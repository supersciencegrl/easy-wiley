         <title>Rapid Methylation of Aryl Bromides Using Air&#8208;Stable DABCO&#8208;Bis(Trimethylaluminum) via Nickel Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a metallaphotocatalytic strategy for the selective methylation of (hetero)aryl bromides via nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with bis(trimethylaluminum)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABAl&#8208;Me3), as a commercially available, air&#8208;stable, and non&#8208;pyrophoric aluminum&#8208;based reagent. The method enables a fast, robust, and scalable methylation protocol that broadly accommodates various functional groups while preventing protodehalogenation. Mechanistic studies confirm the unprecedented generation of methyl radicals from an organo&#8208;aluminum precursor under photoredox conditions, bypassing the limitations of conventional two&#8208;electron pathways. This work expands the toolbox of practical radical precursors and provides a streamlined approach for selective C(sp2)&#8211;CH3 bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Oxidation of Indoles via Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis in Cooperation with H3PO4 in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed here is the first catalytic enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement of indoles for the efficient synthesis of highly enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The in&#8208;situ generated HBr from substrate oxidation, known to be detrimental to the reaction itself, was perfectly consumed by cathode reduction. Challenges of this process include the difficulty in maintaining the synergy between substrate oxidation and cathode reduction as well as the general incompatibility of a hydrogen bonding catalytic system with the aqueous acidic media. A monophasic system was initially developed, but with little substrate generality. Further analysis of the mechanism and careful optimization allowed the development of a much more general and robust biphasic system that exhibited multiple advantages over chemical oxidation, including broader scope, less waste, milder conditions, and better enantioselectivity. It is also the first demonstration of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis in cooperation with H3PO4 in acidic aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective de novo Construction of Pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused Helicenoids via NHC Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenoids have attracted considerable interest in diverse research areas owing to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of helically chiral molecules has remained a formidable challenge. In particular, the organocatalytic enantioselective construction of heterohelicenoids has witnessed fairly limited progress, presumably due to the lack of rational design of competent substrates, right choice of suitable reactions and highly effective catalytic systems. In this study, we report the helicoselective and divergent synthesis of a new class of pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused [5]helicenoids and [4]helicenoids through an NHC organocatalytic step&#8208;economical (3+3) annulation reaction. The protocol features broad substrate scope, ease of late&#8208;stage functionalization, and excellent stereo&#8208;control with enantioselectivities up to &gt;99%. Moreover, the optical properties of the synthesized oxohelicenoids and their derivatives were characterized to explore their potential applications in material sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Impact of Organic Cation Dipole Moment on Rashba Spin&#8208;splitting in 2D Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rashba spin&#8208;splitting in hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) holds great promise for spintronic applications. However, strategies for controlling Rashba spin&#8208;splitting in these materials remain underexplored. Here, we find organic cation dipole moments play a pivotal role in modulating Rashba effects. By comparing p&#8208;FPEA2PbI4 and PEA2PbI4, we demonstrate that larger dipole moments amplify lattice distortion and local symmetry breaking, as confirmed by second&#8208;harmonic generation. This structural asymmetry doubles the Rashba spin&#8208;splitting energy, quantified through circular photogalvanic effect and circularly polarized light excited photoluminescence. Circular dichroism and magnetic circular dichroism reveal a Rashba&#8208;induced effective magnetic field, while spin pumping resolves a ~50% higher Rashba coefficient in p&#8208;FPEA2PbI4. These results establish a direct correlation between dipole strength and spin splitting in 2D HOIPs, a trend that extends to quasi&#8208;2D and 3D HOIPs. Our work shows dipole engineering as a universal design rule for tailoring Rashba effects in HOIPs, paving the way for high&#8208;efficiency spin&#8208;based optoelectronics and quantum devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Carbon Nitride Colloidal Catalyst for Sustainable Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) photocatalysts have attracted growing interest for the eco&#8208;friendly, solar&#8208;driven synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the catalytic efficiency remains limited by poor accessibility of reactive sites due to the hydrophobic nature and aggregation tendency of conventional g&#8208;C3N4. Here, we report a hydrophilic g&#8208;C3N4 colloidal photocatalyst, synthesized via potassium ion (K+) incorporation and surface grafting with sulfonylcyanide groups, which enables quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic H2O2 production (7,886 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), surpassing most reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based heterogeneous systems. The sulfonylcyanide group is facilitate to O2 adsorption and reduction, while synergistically promoting charge separation with K+ ions. This work demonstrates the potential of hydrophilic g&#8208;C3N4 colloids in quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalysis, and presents a versatile strategy for designing advanced g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts for sustainable chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Scission of Orthogonal Bonds in Four&#8208;Membered Ring Mechanophores upon Activation by a Rotaxane Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4&#8208;membered rings are particularly suited for this as 2 sets of products can be obtained by formal retro&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release/generate a variety of functional molecules. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown promise as photocatalysts for chemical transformations. However, their dense micropores and poor pore connectivity hinder mass transport and charge separation/transfer, limiting their efficiency. Herein, we develop a one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy to synthesize three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous COFs (3DOM&#8208;COFs). This approach uniquely integrates in situ Tp&#8208;Tta COF crystallization with synchronized degradation of polystyrene templates under solvothermal conditions. This method introduces unreported kinetic match between template decomposition and framework growth. Such a confined growth mechanism leads to structurally robust and highly ordered macroporosity without post&#8208;processing. 3DOM architecture enables uniform dispersion of fine ZnCdS nanoparticles for the generation a 3DOM&#8208;COF based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, which exhibits remarkable performance in the oxidation of benzylamine (BA) for simultaneous N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine production with 99% selectivity at a rate of 15.1 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and H2 generation with a rate of 17.8 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. The 3DOM architecture confers 50&#8208;fold faster mass transport than bulk COFs, while the heterojunction facilitates directional charge separation and interface charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the heterojunction optimizes reaction thermodynamics by lowering the potential energy barriers of BA activation. The work pioneers a template&#8208;concurrent synthesis paradigm, resolving COFs' critical pore engineering challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>The Crucial Role of Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Electrocatalytic Oxidative C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage in Lignin Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic oxidative provides a promising alternative to cleaving C&#9472;C bond for converting lignin biomass into high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction usually competes in the aqueous environment. Herein, we successfully recognized that the in situ formed reactive oxygen species O2&#8722; during OER could synergize with the lignin intermediates to facilitate C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage, without additional exogenous oxidants.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidative cleavage of the C&#9472;C bond is highly effective for converting lignin biomass into high&#8208;value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at applied oxidative potential usually competes in the aqueous environment. In this study, we found that OER does not entirely hinder the cleavage process but rather acts as a synergistic catalytic step. By using defect&#8208;rich carbon nanotubes as the electrocatalyst and combining experimental and theoretical analysis, we found that the reactive oxygen species (O2&#8722;) formed before *O2 desorption serve as the key oxygen source. These species could interact with the enolate intermediate of lignin, which facilitates the in situ production of aromatic compounds. Under the optimal potential of 0.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl, 98.8% of 2&#8208;phenoxyacetophenone is converted into phenol and benzoic acid via C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage, with yields of 62.31% and 43.42%, respectively. Additionally, the depolymerization of quasi&#8208;natural poplar lignin achieves a total monomer yield of up to 12.41&#160;wt%. This study provides new mechanistic insights into C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage during electrocatalytic lignin depolymerization under alkaline conditions, contributing to efficient biomass valorization.

         <title>Simultaneous Boosting of Second Harmonic Generation and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Metal Halides Through Enhanced Octahedral Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing octahedral off&#8208;centering distortion (D${\mathcal{D}}$) has been demonstrated to boost both second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs). A strong SHG intensity of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP and a high luminescence dissymmetry (glum) factor of 3.82&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 are achieved in R&#8208;SbCl6. The combined SHG and CPL performance surpasses that of previously reported chiral HMHs.








Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), characterized by their non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystal structures and exceptional photophysical properties, are promising for second&#8208;order nonlinear and linear optics, including second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral HMHs with simultaneously strong SHG response and efficient CPL still present a challenge, due to the distinct structural and electronic requirements of these properties. Here, we report a halogen substitution strategy within inorganic octahedra to modulate the crystal structure and simultaneously enhance both SHG and CPL properties. Three pairs of chiral Sb&#8208;based HMHs are synthesized: (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr6 (MBA = &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylammonium, IA&#160;=&#160;imidazole, abbreviated as R/S&#8208;SbBr6), (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr2.8Cl3.2 (R/S&#8208;SbBr2.8Cl3.2), and (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbCl6 (R/S&#8208;SbCl6). The gradual halogen substitution from R/S&#8208;SbBr6 to R/S&#8208;SbCl6 significantly enhances the structural chirality of inorganic octahedra, resulting in a strong SHG response intensity of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor of 3.82&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The combination of SHG and CPL performance outperforms that of previous chiral HMHs. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that these enhancements originate from gradually increased octahedral distortions induced by halogen substitution. This work establishes a structural optimization strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance SHG and CPL in chiral HMHs, paving the way for their broader photonic applications.

         <title>Activatable Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Macromolecular Probe for Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Natural Killer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) macromolecular probe is developed based on the optimized fluorophore scaffold with a long absorption maximum and high PA brightness. This probe enables dual&#8208;mode noninvasive, real&#8208;time in vivo monitoring of tumor&#8208;associated natural killer cells in the tumor immune microenvironment.








Abstract
Detection of tumor&#8208;associated natural killer cells (TANKs) is crucial for evaluating cancer immunotherapy because they are found to be associated with improved overall survival rate. However, existing analytical methods relying on tissue biopsy are invasive and static, restricting their capacity to deliver dynamic information. Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) macromolecular reporter (BhCyNK) for real&#8208;time imaging of TANKs. To optimize the PA performance, the fluorophore scaffold of BhCyNK is screened. Among four hemicyanine derivatives, BhCyS with the longest absorption maximum (&#8764;800&#160;nm) as well as the highest photothermal conversion efficiency (71.13%) and PA brightness is constructed into BhCyNK, which specifically triggers its NIRF signal (by 10&#8208;fold increase) and PA signal (by 8.3&#8208;fold increase) in the presence of a TANK&#8208;overexpressed protease. BhCyNK effectively distinguishes natural killer cells from other immune cells including T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The high specificity of BhCyNK enables real&#8208;time monitoring of TANKs population in the tumor of living mice amid cancer immunotherapies. The imaging results reveal that the increasing intratumoral signal of BhCyNK after combination immunotherapy correlates well with the increasing population of TANKs. Thus, this study not only reports a molecular strategy to develop efficient PA fluorophores but also provides an ideal tool for noninvasive monitoring of immune cells.

         <title>Boosting Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Sodium&#8208;Bromine Batteries via Chlorine&#8208;Bromine Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sodium&#8211;bromine battery system addresses the safety and gas&#8208;related challenges of Na&#8208;Cl2 batteries and the kinetic limitations of Na&#8208;Br2 batteries. By introducing polyanionic BrCl2&#8722;, a stable two&#8208;electron redox mechanism is achieved, significantly enhancing energy density. This work elucidates the critical role of Br&#8208;Cl chemistry, offering a promising strategy for safe and efficient wide&#8208;temperature energy storage.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operable over a wide temperature range is critical for sustainable energy storage. Sodium&#8208;chlorine (Na&#8208;Cl2) batteries show promising high theoretical energy densities but face significant safety challenges due to gaseous chlorine, particularly at high temperatures. Replacing Cl2 with liquid Br2 to construct a new Na&#8208;Br2 battery mitigates gas risks but introduces issues with sluggish reaction kinetics and high&#8208;temperature volatility.

&lt;p&gt;A novel sodium&#8211;bromine battery system addresses the safety and gas-related challenges of Na-Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and the kinetic limitations of Na-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. By introducing polyanionic BrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, a stable two-electron redox mechanism is achieved, significantly enhancing energy density. This work elucidates the critical role of Br-Cl chemistry, offering a promising strategy for safe and efficient wide-temperature energy storage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high-energy-density batteries operable over a wide temperature range is critical for sustainable energy storage. Sodium-chlorine (Na-Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries show promising high theoretical energy densities but face significant safety challenges due to gaseous chlorine, particularly at high temperatures. Replacing Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with liquid Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to construct a new Na-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery mitigates gas risks but introduces issues with sluggish reaction kinetics and high-temperature volatility. To overcome these limitations, we developed a revolutionary Na-Br(+) battery based on the activated Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, pioneering a stabilized redox process via Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/BrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction with Ultrahigh Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine (PEI)&#8208;modified Cu under acidic conditions is reported as a catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) for NO3&#8722; accumulation and electroreduction to NH3, with impressive half&#8208;cell energy efficiencies of 37.1% and 44.1% in 10&#160;mM and 0.5&#160;M NO3&#8722; solution (pH&#160;=&#160;1), respectively, higher than most reported values.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is an important feedstock for industry, an ideal energy carrier, and a perspective storage media for hydrogen. Recently, electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction under acidic conditions has received considerable attention but it suffers from limited efficiency especially under low NO3&#8722; concentration. Here, we report an in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Cu under acidic conditions as a catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) for electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3. Such CEI can effectively accumulate NO3&#8722; anions via static interactions and accelerate *NO hydrogenation to *NOH by weakening *NO intermediate adsorption on Cu site, thereby facilitating NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Such CEI delivers an increased NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83.5% and an impressive half&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 37.1% in 10&#160;mM NO3&#8722; solution (pH&#160;=&#160;1). The NH3 FE and EE can further increase to 90.2% and 44.1% in 0.5&#160;M NO3&#8722;, respectively. The high EE of CEI surpasses previously reported catalyst performances for NO3&#8722; reduction. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel NO3&#8722;&#8208;furfural battery, showcasing a self&#8208;power electrocatalytic system capable of simultaneously treating NO3&#8722; pollutants, generating value&#8208;added NH3 and upgrading biomass. This work offers valuable insights into the construction of a CEI to enhance the efficiency of NH3 synthesis.

         <title>The Doping Effects on the NIR Emission Enhancement of Gold Nanoclusters and the Application in Efficient NIR&#8208;OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping effects have been clearly established based on alloy nanoclusters Au22&#8208;xCux (tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;6). The more Cu doped, the higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Au19Cu3 and Au17.1Cu4.9 show remarkable solution NIR emission under ambient conditions with the PLQYs at &#8764;710&#160;nm being &#8764;55% and &#8764;72%, respectively. A remarkable external quantum efficiency of &#8764;15.43% is achieved from a NIR&#8208;OLED with Au16Cu6 as the emitting layer, showing the prospect of metal NCs for potential applications in NIR&#8208;OLED.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive materials. A series of highly red/NIR luminescent Au&#8211;Cu nanoclusters have been synthesized, Au22&#8208;xCux (tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;6) (Au22&#8208;xCux). Compared with the parental cluster Au22(tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (Au22), doping effects have been clearly established: the more the amount of doping Cu, the higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Remarkable solutions for NIR emission under ambient conditions are found with Au19Cu3 and Au17.1Cu4.9, and the PLQYs at &#8764;710&#160;nm are &#8764;55% and &#8764;72%, respectively. The study on excited state dynamics of these clusters reveals that the more copper atoms doped, the slower nonradiative decay and the faster intersystem crossing rate, the higher PLQY. Surprisingly, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8764;15.43% is achieved from a NIR&#8208;OLED with Au16Cu6 as the emitting layer, showing the prospect of metal NCs in potential applications for NIR&#8208;OLED.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage C&#9472;N Bond Cleavage Enables Diversification of Multiple Resonance Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a novel synthesis methodology for multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) materials. The selective carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond cleavage of MR frameworks enables the introduction of a wide range of aryl groups that are otherwise difficult to incorporate via conventional borylation methods. This late&#8208;stage functionalization approach boosts the optoelectronic properties of MR materials. As a representative example, DABNA&#8208;dimer exhibited improved EL performance.








Abstract
Recent advances in materials development for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been driven by an emerging design concept known as multiple&#8208;resonance (MR), which provides the benefits of high efficiency and color purity required for commercial OLED displays. Borylation reaction constructing MR frameworks is a key step for developing new &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, while this reaction includes the limitation of selectivity, making it challenging to control reactions in elaborate molecular structures. Although a wide variety of MR compounds have been prepared through carefully planned synthetic schemes based on retrosynthetic analysis, these tasks typically require significant effort for each individual target. Herein, we demonstrate a successful late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy that enables structural modifications after the borylation reaction, especially in hardly accessible regions in MR structures via carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond cleavage. Our new synthetic method also allows access to new products which were never feasible before. The newly developed material, DABNA&#8208;dimer, proves the impact of late&#8208;stage functionalization on OLED characteristics. The present study serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a diversity&#8208;orientated synthesis in the development of MR materials.

         <title>Probing the Heteroepitaxial Seeded Growth and Self&#8208;Sorting Processes of Segmented Co&#8208;Micelles with Chemically Distinct Crystalline Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of heteroepitaxial crysta&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of copolymers with chemically distinct core&#8208;forming block, revealing micelle core lattices through self&#8208;assembly and lattice energy simulations, offering insights into energetic penalties and enabling screening of copolymer candidates for heteroepitaxial growth.








Abstract
The ability to produce uniform micellar nanoparticles with controlled dimension and spatially controlled functionality is a key challenge in nanoscience. Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of block copolymers (BCP) has emerged as an effective approach to generate uniform size&#8208;tunable core&#8208;shell micellar nanoparticles; however, most core&#8208;shell micelles generated via CDSA consist of a continuous crystalline core from BCPs with the same core&#8208;forming block. Herein, we perform insightful studies of heteroepitaxial CDSA process from chemical distinct core&#8208;forming poly(ferrocenyldimethylgermane) (PFDMG) and poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PFDMS) based BCPs to produce segmented block comicelles. The heteroepitaxial growth process produced micelles with kinetically trapped crystalline cores that are thermodynamically less stable than the materials formed via spontaneous nucleation. This was rationalized by determining the previously unknown core lattice of PFDMG micelles, self&#8208;assembly experiments, and theoretical lattice energy calculations, providing an insight into the energetic penalty associated with heteroepitaxial growth. These methods for determining the theoretical core lattice energies in these BCP systems could provide a way to screen BCP candidates that can undergo heteroepitaxial growth. Furthermore, by using our newfound understanding of these micelle systems, we achieved the formation of micelles with crystalline cores that undergo self&#8208;sorting, driven by self&#8208;seeding from fragmented triblock comicellar structures.

         <title>Circumventing Scaling Relations via Gradient Orbital Coupling Promotes Ammonia Electrosynthesis on Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy has been proposed to boost NO3&#8722; electroreduction to NH3 through constructing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling by lanthanide element doping in Co3O4 catalyst. It can tune the adsorption and circumvent scaling relations of key *H and *NO intermediates, achieving high faradaic efficiency and good stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.








Abstract
Highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH3) relies on the balanced activation of various substrates including nitrate and water, but is currently hindered by the inherent scaling relations governing the adsorption of key reaction intermediates, such as *NO and *H. Herein, we develop a strategy to circumvent these limitations by introducing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling in cobalt oxide (Co3O4) through Ce doping. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the lattice strain triggered by the dopant redistributes electron density at the Co and O sites, thereby modulating the adsorption strengths of *NO and *H, which favors the production of NH3 while suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction. It exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 97.8% and a high yield rate of 3423.0&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, Ce/Co3O4 catalyst shows robust performance over a wide range of nitrate concentrations (from 5 to 200&#160;mM) and excellent cycling stability. Our findings also suggest that the gradient orbital coupling approach can be extended to other lanthanide dopants (e.g., Pr and Nd), offering a broadly applicable platform to break scaling relations and improve NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 activity on cobalt catalysts.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Linking of Primary and Secondary Alkyl Amines with CS2 Under Ambient Aerobic Oxidation for Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet highly effective bioconjugation strategy enables the near&#8208;perfect hetero&#8208;selective cross&#8208;linking of primary and secondary alkyl amines using CS2 under mild conditions.








Abstract
Umpolung of primary amines via isothiocyanation presents an attractive approach for cross&#8208;linking biorelevant molecules through two nucleophilic handles. However, conventional isothiocyanation reactions typically require highly electrophilic reagents or strongly oxidative conditions, rendering them unsuitable for complex molecular systems. Herein, we present a robust and nonchemist&#8208;friendly protocol for the isothiocyanation of primary alkyl amines using CS2 under ambient aerobic oxidation conditions, eliminating the need for additional promoters. These mild conditions not only ensure broad compatibility with endogenous functional groups in biorelevant molecules but also unlock a powerful new capability: selective differentiation between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Notably, the unique suppression of homo&#8208;linking for both primary and secondary amines under these conditions enables near&#8208;perfect hetero&#8208;selectivity in cross&#8208;linking two different biorelevant molecules via their abundant amino handles in a one&#8208;pot operation, offering a streamlined, thiol&#8208;independent, and small&#8208;footprint approach to biocompatible conjugation.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Cooperative Strategy for Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Layer toward Fully Printed High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free small molecule BDT&#8208;MB with high mobility is designed, and a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy was further proposed by combining with polymer D18. This strategy successfully solved the issues of unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution in blade&#8208;coated small molecule hole transport layers (HTLs) caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity. Ultimately, a printable, uniform, and ordered fiber&#8208;like morphology dopant&#8208;free HTL film facilitated record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04% for small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (0.062 cm2) and large&#8208;area fully printed modules (15.64 cm2).








Abstract
Enabling large&#8208;area deposition of dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport layers (HTLs) with high reproducibility and uniformity is crucial for fully printed n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) modules. However, typical polymer hole transport materials (HTMs), with non&#8208;Newtonian fluid characteristics, show shear rate&#8208;dependent viscosity during the printing process, whereas blade&#8208;coated small&#8208;molecule HTLs often exhibit unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity; these factors impose challenges on blade&#8208;coating of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area HTL films. Here, we designed a dopant&#8208;free small molecule BDT&#8208;MB with high mobility and further proposed a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy by combining with polymer D18. The mechanism was clearly clarified that the pre&#8208;aggregated polymer D18 acted as a &#8220;seed crystal&#8221; to induce preferential face&#8208;on orientation of small molecule BDT&#8208;MB through intermolecular C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction. This strategy not only suppresses the unfavorable assembly behavior of small molecular HTMs but also overcomes the solute random distribution by tuning the solution with high and constant viscosity. It facilitates printing large&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free HTLs with high uniformity and ordered fiber&#8208;like morphology. The resultant small&#8208;area pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area fully printed modules (15.64&#160;cm2) both achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04%.

         <title>NbGa2S4(S2): A Rare Linear [S2]2&#8722; Coordination to Niobium Resulting in Simultaneously Large SHG Effect and Giant Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare linear [S2]2&#8722; dimer coordinated to Nb4+ in NbGa2S4(S2) results in exceptional bonding flexibility, which gives rise to giant optical anisotropy, a strong second harmonic generation effect and significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion.








Abstract
We report a novel niobium thiogallate, NbGa2S4(S2), featuring a rare linear [S2]2&#8722; coordination to niobium, which simultaneously exhibits a strong second harmonic generation effect [1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;benchmark AgGaS2 (AGS)], a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (5.7&#160;&#215;&#160;AGS), and a giant birefringence (0.29 at 2 &#181;m, the largest among all reported 3D chalcogenides). Theoretical studies reveal that the polarizability anisotropy and hyperpolarizability are significantly enhanced due to the unique alignment of [S2]2&#8722; dimer within the crystal lattice. Additionally, the compound demonstrates exceptional chemical bond flexibility, which leads to significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion, one order of magnitude smaller than that of the benchmark AGS.

&lt;p&gt;A rare linear [S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dimer coordinated to Nb&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; in NbGa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) results in exceptional bonding flexibility, which gives rise to giant optical anisotropy, a strong second harmonic generation effect and significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a novel niobium thiogallate, NbGa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), featuring a rare linear [S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; coordination to niobium, which simultaneously exhibits a strong second harmonic generation effect [1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;benchmark AgGaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (AGS)], a high laser-induced damage threshold (5.7&#160;&#215;&#160;AGS), and a giant birefringence (0.29 at 2 &#181;m, the largest among all reported 3D chalcogenides). Theoretical studies reveal that the polarizability anisotropy and hyperpolarizability are significantly enhanced due to the unique alignment of [S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dimer within the crystal lattice. Additionally, the compound demonstrates exceptional chemical bond flexibility, which leads to significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion, one order of magnitude smaller than that of the benchmark AGS. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of next-generation functional materials with tailored optical and thermal characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Detection of Virus&#8208;Membrane Interactions Using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viral binding and fusion are early steps during viral infection. Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy enables the label&#8208;free tracking of molecular events, as the influenza A virus interacts with a host cell model membrane, providing chemical resolution for viral proteins, viral lipids, and host lipids.








Abstract
Viral binding and membrane fusion are essential steps in viral infection, mediated by viral proteins that bind to host cell receptors and facilitate the fusion between viral and host membranes. Targeting these steps for the development of new antiviral strategies requires methods that enable investigating virus&#8208;membrane interactions under in&#8208;situ conditions, while providing mechanistic insights on a molecular level. Here, we demonstrate the use of surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy combined with tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) for the label&#8208;free detection of virus&#8208;membrane interactions, using the Influenza A/X&#8208;31 virus (IAV) as a model. Exploiting the nanometer&#8208;scale surface&#8208;sensitivity of SEIRA, we detect the vibrational fingerprint of IAV's hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, as it specifically binds to sialic acid receptors of the ganglioside GD1a in the tBLM, mimicking the host membrane. Triggering viral fusion via a pH change, we identify structural changes of HA engaging with the host membrane model. Moreover, by constructing the tBLM from deuterated lipids, we utilize the vibrational isotope effect and distinguish between viral and model membrane, providing a basis to track lipid mixing. This approach establishes a powerful tool for spectroscopic studies of the function and inhibition of viral proteins, while still embedded in intact virus particles.

         <title>AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA: an All&#8208;in&#8208;One Digital Microfluidic Platform for Rapid and Automatic Digital Nucleic Acid Analysis</title>

         <dc:description>
We introduce an all&#8208;in&#8208;one AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA platform, a novel, rapid, and automated method for absolute quantitation of influenza A and B viruses. This digital microfluidics&#8208;based approach completes the entire workflow from sample preparation to digital read&#8208;out within 60&#160; minutes.








Abstract
Accurate nucleic acid quantification analysis (NQA) is crucial for disease treatment and prevention. However, existing digital NQA methods often lack sufficient automation and speed. In this study, we introduce a novel rapid and automated active&#8208;matrix digital microfluidics&#8208;based droplet digital recombinase polymerase amplification method (AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA). This method can quantify influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) within a mere 60&#160;min, covering the entire workflow from nucleic acid extraction to digital amplification, fluorescence detection, and statistical analysis. We fabricated an AM&#8208;DMF chip equipped with high&#8208;throughput electrodes and optimized its control logic. Leveraging an artificial intelligence droplet navigation algorithm, we successfully achieved motion and mixing operations of high&#8208;throughput droplets (4608 droplets, each with a volume of 0.9&#160;nL). A dual&#8208;target RPA system was designed to detect IAV and IBV, and its detection performance was fine&#8208;tuned. Experiments conducted with clinical samples revealed that this method exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity for single&#8208;molecule detection, with a detection limit of 1.69 copies per reaction, and it achieved 100% concordance with qPCR results. This groundbreaking quantification technology holds tremendous promise for advancing disease diagnosis, treatment, and fundamental research.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State and Clustering Effects in Fe&#8208;Complex Negolytes for Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonate&#8208;substituted Fe complex exhibits a formal potential of &#8722;0.44&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl and an exceptional rate constant of 0.69&#160;cm s&#8208;1. Near&#8208;neutral redox flow batteries with 0.5&#160;M Fe complex show excellent stability over 300 cycles without capacity fading. It is attributed to hydrogen bonding, which reinforces Fe&#8211;ligand coordination and promotes trimeric cluster formation, in contrast to that of the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted Fe complex.









Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective redox&#8208;active materials are essential for advancing redox flow batteries (RFBs). Iron, with its abundance and suitability as a redox couple, is a promising candidate; however, achieving stable and fast redox reactions in aqueous RFBs remains a challenge. This study presents an Fe&#8208;based negolyte stabilized by a hexadentate ligand, where Fe&#8211;ligand bonds are enhanced through intermolecular interactions. The sulfonate&#8208;substituted Fe complex exhibits a formal potential of &#8722;0.44&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl and an exceptionally high rate constant of 0.69&#160;cm s&#8722;1. Near&#8208;neutral RFBs incorporating 0.5&#160;M Fe complex show excellent cycling stability, with no discernible capacity fading over 300 cycles. This performance is attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bonds that reinforce Fe&#8211;ligand coordination and promote the formation of stable trimeric clusters. Operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory reveal that &#960;&#8208;backdonation from Fe(II) to the imino&#8208;phenolate moiety further stabilizes the complex after reduction. In contrast, the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted complex exhibits inferior stability due to weaker hydrogen bonding and less pronounced &#960;&#8208;backdonation. These findings underscore the importance of ligand design and intermolecular interactions in developing cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active materials for aqueous RFBs.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Doping: Sulfur&#8208;Induced Electronic and Interfacial Dynamics for Advanced Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers that sulfur doping simultaneously narrows the bandgap of Co3O4 and disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks of H2O within the electric double layer. This not only reduces the electron transfer barriers but also promotes H2O dissociation for nitrate hydrogenation. The &#8220;electronic&#8208;interfacial synergy&#8221; strategy presented here sets up a transformative paradigm for proton&#8208;coupled reactions.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) offers a sustainable route for NH&#8323; synthesis and environmental remediation, yet it is hindered by sluggish kinetics due to inefficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and inadequate electrocatalyst design. Conventional approaches primarily focus on the bulk electronic modulation of the electrocatalyst while neglecting interfacial water dynamics. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;functional sulfur&#8208;doping strategy in Co3O4 (S&#8208;Co3O4) to simultaneously enhance bulk conductivity and optimize interfacial proton transfer. Through innovative benzene sulfonyl chloride blocking experiment, in situ spectroscopic analyses, and kinetic isotope effect studies, we reveal that sulfur doping narrows the bandgap of Co3O4 to enhance bulk charge transport while disrupting rigid hydrogen&#8208;bond network of water in the electric double layer; the weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded H2O reduces the dissociation barrier and facilitates proton supply for nitrate hydrogenation. The proposed &#8220;electronic&#8208;interfacial synergy&#8221; strategy establishes a transformative paradigm for designing electrocatalysts in PCET&#8208;driven reactions, advancing sustainable energy conversion and environmental applications.

         <title>Flexible&#8208;Linked Oligomeric Acceptors: Precise Synthesis and Enhanced Photovoltaic/Mechanical Properties for Stretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three oligomeric acceptors with progressively increasing molecular weights, named 2YF&#8208;Br (3649&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), 4YF&#8208;T (7222&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), and 6YF&#8208;BT (10&#160;953&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), were precisely synthesized. Remarkably, the optimized molecular weight of the acceptors simultaneously achieved enhanced photovoltaic efficiency, thermal stability, and mechanical robustness. The acceptor with the largest molecular weight (6YF&#8208;BT) facilitated the highest crack&#8208;onset strain (25.92%) and the exceptional device stretchability (strain at PCE80%&#160;=&#160;35%).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are among the most promising technologies for wearable power applications. However, the development of electron acceptors that simultaneously meet the demands for high performance and mechanical stretchability remains a significant challenge. In this study, we creatively synthesized three oligomeric acceptors with flexible linkers (2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT) and achieved both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs. Benefiting from an improved fibrous morphology and excellent charge dynamics, rigid OSCs based on 4YF&#8208;T demonstrated a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.76%, outperforming devices based on 2YF&#8208;Br and 6YF&#8208;BT. Additionally, the thermal stability of rigid OSCs progressively improved with increasing molecular weight, from 2YF&#8208;Br to 6YF&#8208;BT. Furthermore, the enlarged molecular weight of the acceptors significantly enhanced mechanical stretchability, with crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) values of 16.11%, 20.62%, and 25.92% for 2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT, respectively. Importantly, as molecular weight increased, the mechanical robustness of IS&#8208;OSCs also improved, with 6YF&#8208;BT&#8208;based devices achieving remarkable stretchability (strain at PCE80%&#160;=&#160;35%). This study introduces a new class of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptors with well&#8208;defined structures, paving the way for the advancement and practical application of IS&#8208;OSCs in wearable electronics.

         <title>Thio&#8208;Tetracosulene: A Highly Twisted Molecular Plectoneme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thio&#8208;tetracosulene, the first macrocyclic aromatic compound (MAC) with a plectonemic configuration, has been synthesized by sulfur fluorine annulative substitution. Distinct from topological knot&#8208;, or M&#246;bius&#8208;type MACs which rely on the connection pattern to induce chirality, the asymmetric structure of thio&#8208;tetracosulene is generated and stabilized by the tendency of a macrocycle in distress to reduce unfavourable strain. 








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of thio&#8208;tetracosulene 3, a highly twisted chiral macrocycle constructed via sulfur fluorine annulative substitution from a cyclometaphenylene derivative. It is the first macrocyclic aromatic compound with a plectonemic configuration, and the structure is unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study. The two enantiomers of 3 can be resolved to investigate their chiroptical properties. In contrast to the known topological knot&#8208;, or M&#246;bius&#8208;type macrocycles which induce chirality by specific connection patterns, the asymmetric structure of 3 is formed and maintained by the tendency of a ring in distress to reduce unfavorable strains.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Mediated Photoreversible Switch Between 2D and 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting weak hydrogen bonds and solution processability of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), reversible switch between two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional HOF is realized by light&#8208;triggered ring&#8208;open/close isomerization of diarylethene unit. Lanthanide is loaded into the HOF and utilized as a security ink, enabling the photoreversible conversion of visible/invisible information patterns.








Abstract
In photoresponsive crystalline porous materials, the light&#8208;driven reversible topological transformation is of particular interest, as it can cause an overall change in structure and lead to more drastic switch in material properties, but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;OF) self&#8208;assembled by photochromic diarylethene (DAE) and tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane (TAM) via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Light irradiation drives isomerization of DAE, and the internal strain generated during photoisomerization is released through dissolution and recrystallization, which are accompanied by the breaking and reestablishment of hydrogen bonds. Benefit from the weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds as well as the good solution processability of HOFs, solution&#8208;mediated reversible switch between 3D and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) HOF is achieved by ring&#8208;open/ring&#8208;close photoisomerization of the DAE moiety controlled by remotely alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Loading lanthanide complex into HOF enables DAE photoisomerization&#8208;controlled photochromic fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between the lanthanide and DAE moiety, resulting in reversible luminescence on/off switch in the host&#8208;guest, capable of intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting in a noninvasive manner.

         <title>Co&#8208;sustained Release Strategy of Nonflammable Gel Polymer Electrolytes Enables Long&#8208;Life Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a capsule&#8208;like gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with a co&#8208;sustained release effect for sodium metal batteries. The designed GPE, featuring an insoluble polymer matrix and carbonate co&#8208;solvents, effectively mitigates phosphate&#8208;induced corrosion on sodium metal anode. More importantly, the formed NaF&#8208;rich SEI layers and the preferred orientation help to suppress sodium dendrite growth and improving sodium deposition/stripping performance.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are considered promising candidates for high energy&#8208;density batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and cost effectiveness. However, the intrinsic flammability of GPE poses challenges for their widespread application. Inspired by the concept of the capsules, a triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based GPE with co&#8208;sustained release effect has been designed. This structure features an insoluble ethoxylated trimethylopropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer matrix combined with carbonate co&#8208;solvents, effectively reducing the corrosion of TEP on sodium metal anodes while maintaining a continuous flame&#8208;retardant effect. In this distinctive structure, the abundant carbonyl group on ETPTA promotes the uniform migration of sodium ions, whereas the carbonate co&#8208;solvent facilitates the formation of a NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, effectively suppressing the growth of sodium dendrite. Low content of TEP guide the preferential orientation of the (100) crystal plane of sodium anode, enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability. Na/GPE/Na cells can achieve stable cycling for over 1600 h, and the NVP/GPE/Na full cells exhibit 86.6% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. Moreover, the engineered GPE enables the operation of a 4.5&#160;V high&#8208;voltage cathode for 500 cycles. This strategy paves a new way for designing high&#8208;safety GPE tailored for high&#8208;performance SMBs.

         <title>Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Lithium Metal in Cubic Wulff Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study&#160;successfully achieved precise control over cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating the anodic interface and optimizing the deposition pressure, while demonstrating kinetically&#8208;driven morphology evolution and substrate&#8208;engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. This achievement reconciles the long&#8208;standing discrepancy between theoretical predictions of Wulff structures and experimental observations.








Abstract
Electrodeposition of lithium (Li) metal is crucial for highenergydensity rechargeable Li batteries. The electrodeposition morphology governs the reversibility of the deposition/dissolution reaction, thereby impacting battery performance and safety. Various morphologies, including hemispherical, granular, columnar, and whisker&#8208;like structures, have been realized by modulating the deposition thermodynamics and kinetics. However, the intrinsic Li deposition structure matching the body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) structure remains unexplored. Here, we first precisely&#160;controlled cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating anodic interface and optimizing deposition pressure, while demonstrating kinetically&#8208;driven morphology evolution and substrate&#8208;engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. These findings integrate the thermodynamic theory of crystal growth with interface engineering, completing the missing piece in the cubic Wulff construction of Li metal and providing a new paradigm for controlling the morphology of metal electrodes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrodeposition of lithium (Li) metal is crucial for highenergydensity rechargeable Li batteries. The electrodeposition morphology governs the reversibility of the deposition/dissolution reaction, thereby impacting battery performance and safety. Various morphologies, including hemispherical, granular, columnar, and whisker-like structures, have been realized by modulating the deposition thermodynamics and kinetics. However, the intrinsic Li deposition structure matching the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure remains unexplored. Here, we first precisely&#160;controlled cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating anodic interface and optimizing deposition pressure, while demonstrating kinetically-driven morphology evolution and substrate-engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. These findings integrate the thermodynamic theory of crystal growth with interface engineering, completing the missing piece in the cubic Wulff construction of Li metal and providing a new paradigm for controlling the morphology of metal electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiotemplated Polyketide Chain Fusion and Reductive Cyclization Build the Reactive Butenolide Core of Malleicyprol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malleicyprol, a virulence factor of notorious animal and human pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group, results from the fusion of two individual polyketide chains. The noncanonical condensation domain of the PKS&#8211;NRPS hybrid synthetase BurF forms an ester bond, and the terminal reductase domain mediates a reductive chain release followed by ring formation. Biomimetic synthesis of malleicyprol confirms the feasibility of the proposed Knoevenagel&#8208;type intramolecular cyclization process that forms the butenolide ring.








Abstract
Malleicyprol, a virulence factor of notorious animal and human pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group, features a molecular cyclopropanol warhead linked to a reactive butenolide core. Biosynthetic considerations suggested that this heterocycle was formed by the merger of two individual polyketide chains, but the precise mechanism has remained elusive. By combining chemical synthesis, complete in vitro reconstitution of the biotransformation, and mutational analysis, we show that two individually generated polyketide chains are joined by a noncanonical condensation domain of the PKS&#8211;NRPS hybrid synthetase BurF, which forms an ester bond. By mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and trapping of the aldehyde generated from a substrate surrogate, we found that the terminal reductase domain mediates a reductive chain release with concomitant ring formation. The feasibility of the proposed Knoevenagel&#8208;type intramolecular cyclization into the butenolide moiety was confirmed by a biomimetic synthesis of malleicyprol. The elucidation of the unprecedented thiotemplated butenolide biosynthesis by head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion of two polyketide chains not only expands the synthetic biology toolbox but may also inspire the development of antivirulence strategies against BP pathogen infections.

         <title>Single&#8208;Specie Selectivity via Subnanomete Hierarchical Porous Channel Metal&#8208;Organic Gels Toward Ultra&#8208;stable Anodes for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gel polymer electrolytes demonstrate substantial potential for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, yet obtaining exquisite balance between molecular/ion sieving precision enhancement and ion conduction pathway optimization remains a persistent scientific challenge. Here, to assure long&#8208;term stabilized zinc electrodeposition, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;DMF metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) embedded with hierarchical sub&#8208;nanochannels was strategically designed to facilitate single&#8208;specie selectivity toward Zn2+. In accordance with the ion&#8208;sieving transition state theory, the MOG accomplished directional discrimination of DMF solvent and ClO4&#8208; species via synergistic size exclusion effect and interaction force (dipole&#8208;dipole interaction, electrostatic interaction and vdW force), which specifically reduces the sieving activation energy of Zn2+. Furthermore, ClO4&#8208; anions with optimized microstructural dimensions and strong coordination ability have stronger interactions with PAN chain segments and promote the dissociation of Zn2+ from PAN chain segments, which facilitates a smooth Zn2+ flux through distinctive ion transport pathways. Besides, the PAN@ClO4&#8208; complex demonstrates sustainable epitaxial stacking characteristics of crystallographically oriented Zn (002) planes, which promote flat and compact Zn deposition. Consequently, the zinc symmetric battery demonstrates an exceptional cycle life exceeding 7000 hours at 0.2 mA cm&#8208;2, with extremely low overpotential (20 mV). Furthermore, the Zn||I2 cell maintains a capacity retention rate of 81.7% after 10000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>"Gene&#8208;Editing" Design Upgrades Eutectic&#8208;Polymer Electrolytes with Ultra&#8208;High Li+ Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic polymer electrolytes (DEPEs) have emerged as highly promising next&#8208;generation electrolytes, offering unparalleled electrochemical performance and safety. Their excellence stems from a synergistic blend of the robust mechanical stability of solid polymer electrolytes and the exceptional interfacial wettability and superior thermal resilience of deep eutectic electrolytes. However, conventional DEPEs frequently exhibit suboptimal Li+ conductivity due to strong coordination between Li+ and oxygen&#8208;containing polymer moieties. Inspired by the concept of &#8220;gene&#8208;editing&#8221; in biology, we propose a novel deep eutectic polymer electrolyte (GEPE) with precisely tailored molecular architectures. This approach exploits the steric hindrance and electron&#8208;withdrawing inductive effects from isophorone diisocyanate&#8208;derived segments to reduce Li+&#8208;polymer interactions, thereby enabling an extraordinary ionic conductivity of 3.00 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C and a Li+ transference number of 0.61. Remarkably, GEPE exhibits extraordinary cycling stability in Li||Li symmetric cells for over 3000 hours, demonstrating dendrite&#8208;free Li metal deposition during prolonged cycling. Moreover, the assembled lithium metal batteries demonstrate exceptional electrochemical performance when incorporating diverse cathodes, including LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, and LiFePO4. Notably, the Li|GEPE|LiFePO4 cells achieve an impressive nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency and remarkable long&#8208;term stability over 10000 cycles at 5C.</dc:description>

The Bi3+ with (18&#160;+&#160;2) electron configuration facilitates the NFPP cathode with high stability and impressive conductivity due to the high covalent characteristic of the Bi&#9472;O bond, reduced band gap, and well Na+ diffusion capability. The ionic polarization strategy make element doping solution more feasible in improve the rate capability and cycling stability at the same time.








Abstract
The Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode material faces the challenge of coordinating the improvement of high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This study proposes an ionic polarization&#8208;driven defect engineering strategy, which regulates the electronic structure and Na+ transmission dynamics of NFPP through Bi3+ doping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that Bi3+ with (18&#160;+&#160;2) electron configuration significantly enhances the crystal structure stability of NFPP by strengthening the covalency of Bi&#9472;O bonds. Meanwhile, the heterovalent Bi3+ doping optimizes the bandgap of the material (from 3.29 to 0.16&#160;eV) and promotes Na+ diffusion, while introducing lattice defects to provide additional sodium storage sites. The optimized 0.02Bi&#8208;NFPP cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as the half&#8208;cell only takes 31.6&#160;min to charge to 80% at a rate of 1 C, and the capacity decay is only 0.000495&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 per cycle (86.9% capacity retention) over 20,000 cycles at 20 C. The full battery based on hard carbon anode maintains 95.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C. This study reveals the synergistic mechanism between ion polarization effect and lattice defects, and provides a new strategy for designing SIBs cathode materials with both fast charging/discharging capabilities and ultra&#8208;long life.

         <title>Impeding Thermal Atomization Enables Synthesizing Fe2N Cluster Liganded Single Fe&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe2N cluster liganded single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst was made via impending the conventional thermal atomization process. The in situ generated Fe2N clusters can optimate the electronic structures of Fe&#8208;N4 sites, thereby rendering Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst a record&#8208;high oxygen reduction activity of 0.957&#160;V versus RHE in alkali condition.








Abstract
Anchoring a ligand, such as a functional group or a cluster, on the active metal center is an effective strategy for regulating the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we present a nitridation&#8208;induced&#8208;clustering strategy to produce not only SAC Fe&#8208;N4 in N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods, but also Fe2N cluster as a ligand anchored on the active Fe site (Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C). Unlike the conventional iron atomization process, the reactive nitridation process can generate thermodynamically stable Fe2N intermediates by nitriding the initially formed iron oxide, thereby impeding subsequent thermal atomization to fabricate Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Compared to the conventional SAC Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C with Fe&#8208;N4 active sites, the Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods are more active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yielding a record high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.957&#160;V versus RHE in alkaline condition. The Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods can be utilized as air&#8208;cathode catalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries with a charge&#8208;discharge gap of only &#8764;0.658&#160;V and outstanding cyclability up to 1000 h. Theoretical calculations show that the Fe2Nnc ligands indeed modified the electronic structures of Fe&#8208;N4 sites, leading to a lower adsorption energy for the ORR intermediate OH* and facilitating the desorption of OH* and thus higher activity for ORR.

&lt;p&gt;Anchoring a ligand, such as a functional group or a cluster, on the active metal center is an effective strategy for regulating the electronic structure of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we present a nitridation-induced-clustering strategy to produce not only SAC Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in N-doped carbon nanorods, but also Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N cluster as a ligand anchored on the active Fe site (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;nc&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N-C).

         <title>Cl3Al&#8208;PH3 Is a Weak Lewis Pair Allowing the Synthesis of Sterically Highly Hindered Primary and Secondary Alkyl Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak Lewis Pair H3P&#8594;AlCl3 can be conveniently prepared in a solvent such as toluene (up to 4&#160;M). Under ambient conditions and pure form, this adduct is a crystalline compound that can be rather easily handled. It is an excellent reagent for the synthesis of especially sterically hindered alkyl phosphanes (R&#160;=&#160;tBu, Ad). The reaction is highly selective and gives primary or secondary phosphanes.








Abstract
Phosphane (PH3) gas has the highest phosphorus content of all commercial phosphorus compounds, yet its use for valuable chemicals is very limited. Aluminum chloride and phosphane yield quantitatively the adduct Cl3Al&#8208;PH3, which is easy to handle and reacts with a large set of alkyl halides to give phosphonium salts that can be converted to primary phosphanes. This sequence has been generalized to access various secondary and some tertiary phosphanes in excellent yields under mild conditions and short reaction times. With unprecedented ease, these reactions allow, in particular, the preparation of sterically demanding phosphanes, which, as ligands, are key components of highly catalytically competent transition metal complexes.

         <title>Small Fluorinated Aromatic Molecule&#8208;Based Radiofrequency Identification Tags Enabled by Stepwise Tuning of Nuclear Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward design strategy for rationally manipulating the 19F chemical shifts of fluorinated aromatics (FArs) was established to generate an encoding library for the development of affordable molecular identification tags operated at radiofrequency. Digital messages up to 128 bits can be encoded in the mixtures of FArs from this library (termed as Farcodes) with both reversible encryption and irreversible erasure.








Abstract
In the Internet of Things (IoT) network, radiofrequency identification (RFID) is a key enabler for wireless communication, facilitating real&#8208;time monitoring and control. A primary goal of enhancing IoT infrastructure is the development of versatile RFID tags that are of compact size, high capacity, and robust security with seamless read&#8208;write operations. Here, we report a fluorine&#8208;19 nuclear magnetic resonance (19F NMR)&#8208;based molecular encoding strategy using a fluorinated aromatics (FArs) library, termed &#8220;FArsEER&#8221; (fluorinated aromatics&#8208;empowered encoding and reading), to generate small molecule&#8208;based ID tags (Farcodes). By leveraging the structure&#8208;sensitive nature of 19F chemical shift, we developed a stepwise tuning strategy to precisely modulate 19F chemical shift via nuclear shielding. Through a simple one&#8208;step synthesis, we constructed a demonstrating platform of 64 FArs with distinct 19F chemical shifts, enabling the quick generation of binary Farcodes capable of 64&#8208;bit encoding and their facile reading and decoding with 19F NMR. Moreover, by leveraging the solvent&#8208;dependent 19F chemical shifts and hydrolysis&#8208;sensitive property, reversible encryption and irreversible erasure were further achieved with Farcodes for information security applications. With further advancements, Farcode may serve as a promising small molecule&#8208;based RFID tag for secure information storage and communication in IoT networks.

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity Spatiotemporal Cholesterol Detection by Quadrature Phase&#8208;Shifted Polarization Stimulated Raman Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing quadrature phase modulation, the phase&#8208;shifted polarization SRS (QP2&#8208;SRS) microscope enables simultaneous measurement of the &#961;&#8208;related &#967;1111(3)$\chi _{1111}^{( 3 )}$ and &#967;1221(3)$\chi _{1221}^{( 3 )}$ components. In cholesterol molecular measurements, QP2&#8208;SRS leverages the structural differences between cholesterol and other biomolecules to enhance chemical identification and enable sensitive, real&#8208;time cholesterol detection in living systems.








Abstract
Visualizing cholesterol dynamics in living systems in situ remains a fundamental challenge in biomedical imaging. Although fluorescence microscopy requires bulky tags that perturb small molecule behavior, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy enables label&#8208;free detection of CH&#8208;rich molecules. However, conventional SRS probes only polarized Raman components, limiting molecular specificity by seemingly overlapped peaks. Here, we extend SRS microscopy to achieve rapid, comprehensive detection of Raman tensor through quadrature phase&#8208;shifted polarization SRS (QP2&#8208;SRS) microscopy. This technique exploits the underlying molecular signatures by detecting both polarized and depolarized components of third&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(3) that originates from molecular structural features. We adopt a specialized optical delay line that rapidly alternates between parallel&#8208; and perpendicular&#8208;polarization states. QP2&#8208;SRS enables unprecedented distinction of similar molecular species in complex mixtures, demonstrating approximately 10&#215; enhancement in chemical specificity and 5&#215; improvement in analytical accuracy. This enhanced sensitivity enables real&#8208;time monitoring of lipid dynamics in living C. elegans and reveals component heterogeneity and morphological changes of LD in NAFLD livers. QP2&#8208;SRS creates new opportunities for investigating cholesterol&#8208;dependent biological processes in their native environment, with broad potential for chemical imaging with enhanced molecular specificity.

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Z&#8208;Substituted Enamides, Enol Ethers, and Vinyl Sulfides Using Iodine (III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequential functionalization of novel BCP&#8208;substituted ethynylbenziodoxolone (EBX) reagents into heteroatom&#8208; and BCP&#8208;substituted alkenes is described. The addition of N, O, and S nucleophiles on the EBXs was stereoselective and generated heteroatomic Z&#8208;vinylbenziodoxolone (VBX) reagents. The hypervalent iodine bond reacted under mild conditions to give access to Z&#8208;substituted enamides, enol ethers, and vinyl sulfides.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are well&#8208;studied bioisosteres for para&#8208;substituted benzene rings, and numerous methods for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized BCPs have been developed. However, synthetic approaches to access vinyl BCP motifs remain limited, with only few reports on the synthesis of BCP&#8208;olefins bearing heteroatom substituents. Herein, we present the synthesis of BCP&#8208;substituted enamides, enol ethers, and vinyl sulfides through the sequential functionalization of ethynylbenziodoxolone (EBX) reagents containing a BCP scaffold. Stereoselective addition of a nucleophile generates heteroatomic Z&#8208;vinylbenziodoxolone (VBX) reagents. The hypervalent iodine substituent of the VBX reagents serves then as a versatile platform for further arylation, vinylation, and trifluoromethylation. This method provides a modular synthesis of previously inaccessible heteroatom&#8208;substituted vinyl BCPs.

The hypervalent iodine substituent of the VBX reagents serves then as a versatile platform for further arylation, vinylation, and trifluoromethylation. This method provides a modular synthesis of previously inaccessible heteroatom-substituted vinyl BCPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Iron&#8211;Aluminium Reactivity for Dinitrogen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen activation was achieved through cooperative bimetallic reactivity of a Fe&#9472;Al system, which features flexible, covalent metal&#8211;metal bonding, and captures two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Subsequent alkylation of the Al site leads to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex that facilitates the silylation of the terminal N atom. 








Abstract
We report a novel bimetallic approach utilizing cooperative Fe&#9472;Al reactivity for N2 activation on the Cp*Fe(1,2&#8208;Cy2PC6H4AlEt) platform, effectively capturing two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Characterizations of the N2&#8208;bridged Fe&#9472;Al dimer (2) using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy coupled to density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals its electronic structure as a resonance hybrid between Fe(II)&#8208;Al(I) and Fe(0)&#8208;Al(III). The flexible, covalent Fe&#9472;Al bonding facilitates the subsequent alkylation of the Al site with nBuLi, leading to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex (3) that enables the silylation of the terminal N atom. Our findings highlight the significance of leveraging Fe&#9472;Al effects as an electron buffer to achieve facile N2 activation.

         <title>Identification of Isomerically Diverse Ginsenosides Using Engineered Aerolysin Nanopore via Non&#8208;Translocation Blockade Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered aerolysin S278K with enhanced constriction, electro&#8208;osmotic flow (EOF), and interaction capability can trap fast&#8208;moving ginsenoside molecules and detain them for extended observation and characterization before release. This creates a non&#8208;translocation nanopore blockade sensing with high signal precision and resolution, enabling identification of 30 structurally complex and isomerically diverse ginsenosides.








Abstract
Typical nanopore sensing depends on slowed translocation through the pore to acquire effective blockade signals. However, this paradigm often suffers from low signal precision and poor resolution, making it challenging to resolve pools of analytes with diverse, similar structures. Here, we present a non&#8208;translocation blockade sensing based on an engineered aerolysin S278K that enables the identification of isomerically diverse ginsenosides&#8212;a class of glycoconjugates whose structural characterization has been a persistent challenge in glycoscience. By introducing the S278K mutation, the aerolysin acquires a highly positively charged interior and generates intense electro&#8208;osmotic flow and enhanced steric/enthalpic barriers, effectively trapping ginsenoside molecules in the K278&#8208;R220 region and preventing their further translocation. This distinct blockade sensing mode significantly improves the detection capability of aerolysin by prolonging residence time (e.g., 43&#8208;fold longer), enabling detailed molecular characterization. As a result, we demonstrate the unambiguous identification of 30 ginsenosides differing in glycosyl composition, isomerism, modification, and aglycone, as well as the quantitative analysis of complex ginsenosides in real samples by integrating deep learning. This work underscores the promise of non&#8208;translocation nanopore sensing for deciphering structurally complex and diverse small molecule analytes.

         <title>Surface Halide Manipulation for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface halide substitution strategy is applied to establish function&#8208;gradient inorganic perovskite, producing stable chlorine&#8208;rich layers atop iodine&#8208;rich ones, achieving 21.2% efficiency in unit cells and 19.2% efficiency in modules, resulting in a projected T80 lifetime of 7.3 years. This makes them among the most stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices.








Abstract
Iodine&#8208;rich inorganic perovskites possessing desirable bandgaps as well as high thermal and chemical stability are facing serious issues of low polymorphic stability, whereas chlorine&#8208;rich inorganic perovskites hold outstanding thermodynamic stability but suffer from low efficiency. Here, we develop function&#8208;gradient inorganic perovskites adopting a surface halide substitution strategy, where a stable chlorine&#8208;rich skin protects efficient iodine&#8208;rich layers, incorporating high stability of chlorine&#8208;rich perovskites with high efficiency of iodine&#8208;rich perovskites. This strategy simultaneously passivates surface defects and stabilizes the photoactive polymorphs of perovskite, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 21.2% for unit cells (0.16 cm2) and 19.2% for solar modules (23.9 cm2). Notably, the compositional gradient mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and enhances resistance to environmental erosion. Thus, our devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1000 h storage in air and 3200 h operation under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at 40&#160;&#176;C, representing the most stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells reported to date.

         <title>Bypassing In Situ CO Poisoning in Furfural Conversion: Electron&#8208;Deficient Pd Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Enable One&#8208;Step Selective Synthesis of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;deficient Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts unlock a tandem decarbonylation&#8208;hydrogenation pathway for the one&#8208;step selective conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfural to tetrahydrofuran, overcoming the limitations of conventional Pd catalysts that yield furan as the main product due to in situ CO poisoning.








Abstract
The one&#8208;step conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfural (FUR) to tetrahydrofuran (THF) via combining decarbonylation and hydrogenation offers a sustainable alternative to the industrial Reppe process, while the selectivity control remains a significant challenge. Herein, we identify carbon monoxide (CO), in situ generated during FUR decarbonylation, as a major hindrance, significantly inhibiting subsequent furan hydrogenation. To overcome this limitation, a zeolite&#8208;encapsulated Pt1Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst, namely Pt10Pd90@S&#8208;1, is designed, which effectively mitigates CO poisoning and enables efficient FUR conversion to THF, achieving 100% FUR conversion and &gt;93% THF selectivity with good long&#8208;term stability (&#8764;100&#160;h)&#8212;among the highest values reported to date. Mechanistic studies reveal that electron&#8208;deficient Pd species adjacent to single Pt atoms in Pt10Pd90@S&#8208;1 significantly enhance H2 activation and furan adsorption, enabling efficient hydrogenation at both the C&#945; and C&#946; positions of furan despite CO poisoning. Furthermore, the one&#8208;step process is economically viable with a minimum selling price (MSP) of USD 1701 per tonne of THF, and a life cycle assessment shows a CO2 equivalent emission of 1.29 tonnes per tonne of THF&#8212;less than 25% of that of the traditional Reppe process. This work represents a transformative advancement in sustainable THF production, with the potential to revolutionize industrial THF production.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting of Flexible Covalent Organic Pillars for Adaptive Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible covalent organic pillars (flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n) are introduced as a family of dual&#8208;open&#8208;ended nanotubular hosts constructed via dynamic imine condensation between pillararene&#8208;derived macrocyclic building blocks and conformationally mobile &#8211;(CH2)n&#8211; aliphatic linkers. These discrete molecular containers feature well&#8208;defined tubular channels capable of adaptive host&#8211;guest interactions. The self&#8208;assembly process exhibits a pronounced odd&#8208;even effect, yielding either enantiomeric or meso duplexes through distinct chiral self&#8208;sorting pathways. Host&#8208;guest interactions between flex&#8208;COP&#8208;4 and a series of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dibromoalkanes were systematically investigated using NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The resulting inclusion complexes span a continuum of binding modes&#8212;from relaxed encapsulation to strained, overpacked assemblies&#8212;governed by geometric complementarity and mutual host&#8208;guest deformation. These findings highlight the role of conformational flexibility in modulating molecular recognition under nanoscale confinement and establish flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n as a dynamic platform for mimicking adaptive features of biological receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>A 19F&#8208;labeled Probe for the Chiral Discrimination of Thiols and Thioethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing compounds are pivotal in cellular processes such as redox balance and signal transduction. Traditionally, these compounds, especially thiols, are detected using fluorescence probes. However, these probes fall short in targeting thioethers due to their lower reactivity. Moreover, the chiral discrimination of thiols and thioethers typically relies on chromatographic methods, where separation&#8208;free, in&#8208;situ strategies are highly desirable. To address this, we have developed a novel 19F&#8208;labeled chiral platinum probe capable of distinguishing both thiols and thioethers. This technique generates distinct 19F NMR signals that correspond to the stereoconfiguration of the analytes, enabling direct determination of their enantiocomposition. This method holds potential for integration into high&#8208;throughput workflows, boosting pharmaceutical and biological research by facilitating rapid, efficient chiral analysis of crucial compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Caged Hydrocarbons as Arenes Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality plays a crucial role in the biological interactions, safety, and effectiveness of drugs. The increasing use of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for planar benzene moieties in drug design has heightened the need for asymmetric catalysis strategies to produce chiral caged molecules. This minireview showcases recent progress in this rapidly growing research field. 








Abstract
The utilization of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for arenes, especially the phenyl ring, in bioactive compounds has resulted in significant enhancements in potency, solubility, and metabolic stability. These improvements highlight the potential of C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds as a promising motif for the development of drug candidates. However, this strategy has also increased the structural complexity of these molecules, posing synthetic challenges in controlling the chirality of caged and highly decorated bioactive scaffolds. Over the past two years, remarkable progress has been achieved in catalytic asymmetric methodologies for the synthesis of caged hydrocarbons, significantly advancing their utility in chiral drug discovery and development. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent breakthroughs in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral caged hydrocarbons, encompassing bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes, cubanes, and related three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds. Additionally, we highlight the intriguing applications of enantiomerically pure caged hydrocarbons in biological studies. It is anticipated that this minireview will inspire further advancements in the enantioselective synthesis of these pharmaceutically valuable caged hydrocarbons.

         <title>Structurally Engineering Multi&#8208;Shell Hollow Zeolite Single Crystals via Defect&#8208;Directed Oriented&#8208;Kinetics Transformation and Their Heterostructures for Hydrodeoxygenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;directed oriented&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to prepare multi&#8208;shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single&#8208;crystalline feature, hierarchical macro&#8208;/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The resultant multi&#8208;shell hollow Ni&#8208;loaded ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline multi&#8208;shell hollow porous materials with high compartment capacity, large active surface area, and superior structural stability are expected to unlock tremendous potential across diverse critical applications. However, their synthetic methodology has not yet been well established. Here, we develop a defect&#8208;directed oriented&#8208;kinetics transformation approach to prepare multi&#8208;shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single&#8208;crystalline feature, hierarchical macro&#8208;/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The methodology lies in the creation of zeolite precursors consisting of multiple inhomogeneous layers with gradient&#8208;distributed defects along the [100] and [010] directions and irregularly discrete defects&#8208;rich regions along the [001] direction via continuous epitaxial growth. Subsequently, the locations with more defects could be preferentially etched to form voids or mesopores, meanwhile oriented recrystallization interconnects the nanoshells into a unified architecture along the [001] direction. Benefiting from the easily accessible bifunctional metal/acid sites and the capability for reactant accumulation, the resultant multi&#8208;shell hollow Ni&#8208;loaded zeolite catalysts show significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels. The insight gained from this systematic study will facilitate the rational design and synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;shell hollow structured single&#8208;crystalline porous materials for a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung Difluoroalkylation of Imines Enables General Access to &#946;&#8208;Difluoroalkylated Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed umpolung difluoroalkylation of Imines has been developed. By inverting the polarity of imines, this approach enables the coupling of various readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. The rapid fluorine replacement of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in these molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach, demonstrates the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.








Abstract
Fluoroalkylated amines play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, yet the general and efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;difluoroalkylated amines remains elusive. Here, we developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed umpolung strategy that enables the difluoroalkylation of 2&#8208;azaallyl anions generated from aliphatic and aromatic imines, effectively overcoming the previous limitations. By inverting the polarity of imines, this strategy allows for the coupling of a variety of readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. This approach is characterized by its high efficiency, broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and ease of synthesis. The rapid modification of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in bioactive molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach shows the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed umpolung difluoroalkylation of Imines has been developed. By inverting the polarity of imines, this approach enables the coupling of various readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. The rapid fluorine replacement of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in these molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach, demonstrates the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluoroalkylated amines play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, yet the general and efficient synthesis of &#946;-difluoroalkylated amines remains elusive. Here, we developed a nickel-catalyzed umpolung strategy that enables the difluoroalkylation of 2-azaallyl anions generated from aliphatic and aromatic imines, effectively overcoming the previous limitations. By inverting the polarity of imines, this strategy allows for the coupling of a variety of readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. This approach is characterized by its high efficiency, broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and ease of synthesis. The rapid modification of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in bioactive molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach shows the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral 1&#8208;Aryl Isoquinolines via De Novo Isoquinoline Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is reported. An enantioselective de novo isoquinoline ring formation is involved in this process. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step of the reaction and the origin of enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Axially chiral heterobiaryl moieties serve as core skeletons for bioactive molecules, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. Enantioselective de novo formation of the heteroaromatic ring is one of the most straightforward approaches to access enantioenriched heterobiaryls. Herein, an enantioselective de novo construction of isoquinolines by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is disclosed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a variety of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 98% yield and 99:1 er). The synthetic application of the current method was demonstrated by functional group transformations and suitability for millimolar&#8208;scale reactions. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step and provided insight into the origin of the enantioselectivity for this reaction.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput DFT&#8208;Assisted Design of Electrode for Efficient High&#8208;Temperature Electrochemical Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the efficiency and feasibility of the high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculation framework and the role of dopants with various oxidation states for the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical dehydrogenation reaction in energy and environment devices. 








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cell (PCEC) is a promising technique to enable efficient dehydrogenation reactions for producing valuable chemicals, but is still limited by the lack of stable electrocatalysts to achieve efficient O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H dissociation. In this work, upon high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations, Ba(Zr,Co,Fe,M)O3&#8208;based (M represents dopants) perovskite is formulated, and oxygen vacancy formation energy (&#916;Evf${{\Delta}}E_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{f}}$) and hydration energy (&#916;Ehydr) are taken as two key performance indicators to screen potential PCEC electrode materials derived from this category. Trivalent doping elements, particularly Y, Yb, Er, and Tm, achieve a good balance between &#916;Evf${{\Delta}}E_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ and &#916;Ehydr. Experiments further validate that the BaZr0.125Co0.375Fe0.375Tm0.125O3&#8722;&#948; showed impressive dehydrogenation reaction activity, with faradaic efficiency as high as 98.90% in water electrolysis, and outstanding ethane conversion rate (67.60%) and ethylene yield (62.62%) for ethane dehydrogenation reaction at 700 &#176;C. The computational approach can be applied to the rational design of novel electrode materials for other electrochemical reactions in energy and environment devices.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Lithium Recovery From Spent LiFePO4 Stabilizes Ferricyanide Catholyte for Durable Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

Redox&#8208;mediated lithium recovery from spent LiFePO4 batteries enables high&#8208;solubility catholytes (up to 1.74&#160;M [Fe(CN)6]4&#8315;) for ultra&#8208;stable alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries. This dual&#8208;function strategy integrates sustainable lithium recycling with advanced energy storage, achieving enhanced cycling stability and energy density.








Abstract
The scarcity of lithium resources and the increasing volume of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exacerbate the imbalance between lithium supply and demand. The development of efficient recovery strategies of valuable lithium ion (Li+) from spent LIBs and their subsequent utilization presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Here, we propose an innovative approach for Li+ recovery from spent lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries (LFPs) and its subsequent utilization in alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries (AZFFBs). Utilizing a redox&#8208;mediated reaction, we achieve exceptional Li+ recovery efficiency from spent LFPs. Furthermore, the recovered Li+ in solution leads to the elevated ionic strength in the electrolyte, enhancing the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to a remarkable level of 1.74&#160;M. Utilizing the above catholyte, an AZFFB cell demonstrates the cycling life extending to 11&#160;000 cycles with a degradation rate as low as 0.00019% per cycle and 0.09% per day at a current density of 120&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient protocol that eliminates additional intermediate processes, achieving effective Li+ recovery from spent LFPs and subsequent utilization in flow batteries. The resulting AZFFB exhibits high energy density and long lifespan, positioning it as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions.

         <title>Hopping Diffusion in Wiggling Nanopore Architecture of MOF Enabling Synergistic Equilibrium&#8208;Kinetic Separation of Fluorinated Propylene and Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address a critical challenge in electronic specialty gas (ESG) purification, we herein present a zirconium&#8208;based MOF with &#8220;wiggling pore geometry&#8221; featuring alternating narrow apertures and enlarged cavities. This architecture establishes an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation mechanism: narrow windows (nw) kinetically hinder C3F8 diffusion (DC3F6/DC3F8&#160;&#8776;&#160;450), while F&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions in cavities thermodynamically favor C3F6 adsorption.








Abstract
The separation of octafluoropropane (C3F8) from hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) is an industrially important yet challenging process due to their similar physicochemical properties and stringent purity demands in industrial applications. Herein, we address this task through precise pore architecture in a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;PMA), which exhibits unique &#8220;wiggling nanopores&#8221; with narrow windows and large cavities. The narrow windows act as diffusion barriers, selectively restricting C3F8 transport, while the large cavities provide strong adsorption sites for C3F6, enabling an equilibrium&#8208;kinetic synergistic separation. This dual functionality results in a &#8764;450&#8208;fold difference in diffusion rates and exceptional kinetic selectivity for C3F6 over C3F8, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, time&#8208;resolved kinetics, and dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations coupled with in situ spectroscopy elucidate the pore geometry&#8208;dependent hopping diffusion mechanism responsible for the separation. This work establishes wiggling pore geometry as a versatile paradigm for advanced adsorbents targeting energy&#8208;efficient separations of structurally similar fluorocarbon mixtures.

The narrow windows act as diffusion barriers, selectively restricting C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; transport, while the large cavities provide strong adsorption sites for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling an equilibrium-kinetic synergistic separation. This dual functionality results in a &#8764;450-fold difference in diffusion rates and exceptional kinetic selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, time-resolved kinetics, and dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations coupled with in situ spectroscopy elucidate the pore geometry-dependent hopping diffusion mechanism responsible for the separation. This work establishes wiggling pore geometry as a versatile paradigm for advanced adsorbents targeting energy-efficient separations of structurally similar fluorocarbon mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing the Selectivity of CH4 Electrosynthesis from CO2 Over Cuprates Through Cu&#9472;O Bond Length Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selectivity descriptor based on Cu&#9472;O bond length was established to screen highly selective cuprates toward CH4 electrosynthesis. This descriptor revealed that CH4 selectivity exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation with the Cu&#9472;O bond length, with the optimal value accessible at &#8764;1.951&#160;&#197;. Using this descriptor, three new cuprates were predicted, demonstrating better performance compared to the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts in acidic electrolytes.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the nature of Cu&#9472;O bond in Cu&#8208;based oxide catalysts and understanding its correlation with CH4 electrosynthesis (from CO2) for selectivity optimization is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, taking a specific type of cuprates structured with CuO4 square&#8208;planar motifs as the platform, we report a selectivity descriptor of Cu&#9472;O bond length for screening highly selective catalysts toward CH4 electrosynthesis. We establish the descriptor by systematic investigations of several proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cuprates. Their Cu&#9472;O bond lengths are precisely controlled ranging from 1.944 to 1.970&#160;&#197; and these bonds remain stable in CH4 selectivity evaluation. Our investigations demonstrate that the CH4 selectivity exhibits a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Cu&#9472;O bond length, and the optimized value is accessible at about 1.951&#160;&#197;. This could be attributed to the optimal (neither too strong nor too weak) *CO adsorption created by the moderate Cu&#9472;O bond length, facilitating *CO hydrogenation. Furthermore, utilizing this descriptor, we predict three highly selective cuprates for CH4 electrosynthesis, with superior selectivity that is near the top of the volcano plot. And importantly, in an acidic electrolyte (pH&#160;=&#160;1), they outperform the reported catalysts, achieving CH4 selectivity of up to 61.7% at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Signal Circuit for Self&#8208;Regulated Bidirectional Communication in Protocell&#8208;Living Cell Communities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercellular communicating protocell with feedback loop was designed for self&#8208;regulating signal transmission in protocell/living cell community. This DNA&#8208;empowered protocell provides a bottom&#8208;up access route toward synthetic cellular systems with abilities for programming desired cellular behaviors.








Abstract
Developing synthetic biology tools to control cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling can provide new capabilities to engineer cell&#8208;cell communication and program desired cellular behaviors. As cell mimics, abiotic protocells provide an attractive opportunity to modulate the intercellular communication with design&#8208;based regulatory features. Despite the chemical communication of protocells that interact with living cells have been demonstrated, the autonomous regulation of intercellular signal transmission in protocell/living cell community remains a critical challenge. Herein, we designed a DNA circuit consisting of a recognition module, activation module, and feedback module that enables protocells to self&#8208;regulate the interaction with living cells by sensing and responding to the signal released from living cells. The feedback module with renewable capability is capable of processing the signal transduction on the membrane surface of protocells and controlling intercellular adhesion. Once dissociated from living cells, the disengaged protocells allow the following interaction with multiple target living cells in succession. Overall, this work provides an avenue to control and program dynamic signal propagation in protocell/living cell community. The designed communication with living cells would open new ways to tune cellular behavior and apply them to cell&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Enhanced Luminance of Pentaazaphenalene&#8208;Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters by Breaking Forbidden Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly developed 1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (5AP) based emitters with donor and acceptor units have succeeded in converting nonemissive 5AP to highly luminescent emitters by breaking the forbidden transition. These emitters exhibited photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 80% and 90%; both are the highest among the 5AP derivatives reported to date.








Abstract
1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (5AP) derivatives are of growing interest because of their potential for exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence and inverted singlet&#8211;triplet excited state properties. However, a major challenge has been the nonemissive nature of 5AP. This study reports a donor&#8208;5AP&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type molecular design for converting nonemissive 5AP into highly emissive molecules. The newly designed molecules, 2,5&#8208;di(1&#8208;pyrrolidino)&#8208;7,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CF3) and 2,5&#8208;di(1&#8208;pyrrolidino)&#8208;7,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;benzonitrile)&#8208;1,3,4,6,9b&#8208;pentaazaphenalene (Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CN), exhibited delayed fluorescence and achieved high photoluminescence quantum yields of 83.5% and 90.6%, respectively, in solid films. These values dramatically exceed those of previously reported 5AP derivatives with only 8% or less. Furthermore, Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CF3 and Pyr&#8208;5AP&#8208;CN exhibited the fastest radiative decays and the narrowest emission spectra among all the 5AP based materials reported to date. This study provides a promising solution to the nonemissive nature of 5AP, leading to the development of a class of highly luminescent materials for future organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Beyond Structure: Methylation Fine&#8208;Tunes Stability and Folding Kinetics of bcl2Mid G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of a single 5&#8208;methylcytosine into a G&#8208;rich sequence originating from the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene promoter affects both the folding kinetics and thermodynamics of the two G4 structures and thus plays a crucial role in regulating G4 folding pathways, which has significant implications for the control of gene expression.








Abstract
Cytosine methylation, a key epigenetic modification in the regulation of gene expression, raises intriguing questions about its role in the formation and thermodynamic stability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. We investigated the impact of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine residue (Cm) on the well&#8208;characterized bcl2Mid G4 structure that forms in a GC&#8208;rich region of the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene promoter, which influences its expression. Using solution&#8208;state NMR and biophysical techniques, we discovered an unexpected sequence&#8208;specific effect of Cm on the folding kinetics of bcl2Mid G4. Specifically, substituting cytosine at position C6 with C6m&#160; slows down G4 folding kinetics and influences the equilibrium between major and minor structures in the presence of K+ ions. Notably, the increased population of the minor structure enabled the characterization of its previously unidentified topology. Additionally, the presence of a single Cm residue induces local structural rearrangements in the major G4 structure and decreases its thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, we found that the zinc finger 3 motif of the Sp1 transcription factor preferentially binds to the minor G4 structure. These results suggest that Cm not only influences G4 polymorphism but may also regulate interactions with transcription factors, potentially affecting the regulation of gene expression.

Additionally, the presence of a single C&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; residue induces local structural rearrangements in the major G4 structure and decreases its thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, we found that the zinc finger 3 motif of the Sp1 transcription factor preferentially binds to the minor G4 structure. These results suggest that C&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; not only influences G4 polymorphism but may also regulate interactions with transcription factors, potentially affecting the regulation of gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial H&#8208;bond Network/Concentration Fields/Electric Fields Regulation Achieved by D&#8208;Valine Anions Realizes the Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A D&#8208;valine anion interfacial layer reversely regulates the interfacial H&#8208;bond network and the interfacial concentration/electric fields, which realizes the synchronous occurrence of inhibition (suppressing H+ migration by disrupting the interfacial H&#8208;bond interaction and restraining the anion depletion layer formation) and optimization effects (homogenizing the interfacial Zn2+ flow and electric field). 








Abstract
Uncontrolled mobile anions and proton transport result in many issues, including interfacial anion depletion, irregular multiphysics fields fluctuations, space charge layer&#8208;induced interfacial Zn dendrites, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which seriously exacerbates the cycling stability of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, this work constructs an efficient D&#8208;valine anion interface structure to reversely regulate the Zn2+/H+ dynamic chemistry and unlocks the multiple regulation effects of this anionic interface by investigating interfacial proton transport and complex concentration/electric fields distribution of Zn anode through dynamic in&#8208;situ spectroscopy analysis, static energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulation. We unravel core factors affecting complicated interfacial HER processes and the generation of the space charge layer. This anionic interfacial layer severs proton hopping transport by rupturing the initial water&#8211;water hydrogen bond, which effectively restrains uncontrolled HER processes. Further, the anion&#8208;immobilized interfacial layer accelerates Zn2+ transfer to optimize the interfacial concentration fields. Also, the anionic interface restrains the formation of the anion depletion layer by relieving rapid Zn2+ ions exhaustion and strengthening the uniformity of interfacial electrical field distribution, which suppresses space charges&#8208;induced Zn dendrite growth. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells deliver an ultralong cycle life of 4150&#160;h. Importantly, the multiple regulation effects enable Zn||I2 cells exhibit long&#8208;term stable life.

In their Research Article (e202503745), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report a selectivity descriptor based on Cu&#9472;O bond length for screening highly selective cuprates toward CH4 electrosynthesis. This descriptor reveals that CH4 selectivity exhibits a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation with the Cu&#9472;O bond length, with the optimal value accessible at &#8764;1.951&#160;&#197;. Using this descriptor, three new cuprates are predicted, demonstrating better performance compared to the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts in acidic electrolytes.

The air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable Ni(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] is obtained via a unique in&#8208;situ reduction and fluorination mechanism from [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 and Ph2P(&#9552;O)&#9472;PPh2, incorporating typically unstable fluorophosphine ligands. In their Research Article (e202506271), Schirin Hanf et al. demonstrated its utility as a robust Ni(0) source, and showed its superior catalytic activity in coupling reactions compared to the conventional [Ni(COD)2].

The cover artwork, designed by Helen Allmendinger, visualizes a novel synthetic pathway and the first crystallographic characterization of the [cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; anion in the solid state. Although this compound is spectroscopically known since the 1980s it was so far prepared and handled only in solution. By complexing the alkali metal cation with [2.2.2]cryptand, the resulting salts of the [cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; are found to be surprisingly stable in the solid state as reported by Christian M&#252;ller et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202505853).

In their Research Article (e202501930), Guohua Zhao and co&#8208;workers report a novel strategy utilizing the self&#8208;optimizing restructuring behavior of MOFs to construct cation vacancies, which effectively suppresses excessive O&#9472;O bond cleavage during oxygen activation. This strategy promotes the 2e&#8722; pathway for H2O2 production (right) over the 4e&#8722; pathway generating H2O (left). By employing a solid&#8208;state electrolyte cell, direct synthesis of ultrahigh&#8208;concentration H2O2 aqueous solution (&gt;8 wt%) is achieved.

         <title>Manipulation of Chemistry and Biology with Visible Light Using Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes and Azonium Ions</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Azobenzenes (TOABs) in broad daylight: in recent years, TOAB photoswitches became indispensable tools for all&#8208;visible&#8208;light manipulation of chemistry, biology and materials. This review explores their unique photochemical properties, design and synthetic approaches, offering support in choosing a TOAB for a given application.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches are used for precise and reversible control over the properties and function of chemical, biological and material systems, offering exceptional spatiotemporal control. Their current development focuses on enabling operation with non&#8208;damaging and deep tissue penetrating visible/near&#8208;IR light. In this context, tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions play a leading role, thanks to their unique photophysical properties and easily modifiable structure. However, it is only recently that synthetic approaches to those sterically demanding systems have been established and their structure&#8208;photochemistry relations have been understood to provide general rules for their tuning to a given application. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of this family of molecular photoswitches, providing an analysis of their photophysical properties, followed by a discussion of the available synthetic methodologies. Finally, we showcase the versatility of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions for enabling light&#8208;control in biological and material sciences, providing multiple insights for future applications.

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry in Functional Hydrogel Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive overview of research progress in functional hydrogel coatings, the interfacial mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed, and the preparation methods with their respective advantages and disadvantages for hydrogel coatings are summarized. Finally, the challenges in terms of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality are outlined, and a glimpse into future opportunities is offered. 








Abstract
Functional hydrogel coatings can endow the underlying substrate with excellent surface properties, such as anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;fogging, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;abrasion, lubrication, and controllable drug delivery, while hardly changing the mechanical properties of the substrate. Through elaborate interface engineering, hydrogel coatings with high interfacial toughness and controllable thickness have been successfully constructed on different substrate surfaces for widespread applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current research progress in functional hydrogel coatings and the associated interfacial chemistry. First, the interfacial interactions and mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed. Next, the preparation methods for hydrogel coatings are systematically summarized, with a focus on the involved critical chemical groups/reactions and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we highlight the challenges from the perspective of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality, and provide a glimpse into future opportunities, hoping to promote the transformation of functional hydrogel coatings from foundational research to industrial applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Gels as Active Tools for Reaction Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

The unique combination of environments within gels, self&#8208;assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators, offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways, achieving unique reaction outcomes, leading to the emerging concept of supramolecular gels as nanoreactors. Smart chemical engineering methods enable the use of such gels to fabricate materials and devices potentially capable of transforming the way synthesis is done.








Abstract
Supramolecular gels, assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs), are fascinating soft materials for use in synthesis, combining aspects of hetero&#8208; and homogeneous systems. The unique combination of environments within a gel offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways. For example, self&#8208;assembly into a gel network can modify the reactivity of catalytic sites on the LMWG. Controlling the assembly of multiple LMWGs can result in integrated gels with orthogonal activities that could not normally coexist. Enzymes encapsulated within self&#8208;assembled gels can exhibit superactivity, extending their use into solvent media more appropriate for organic synthesis. Highly reactive species, such as ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles or moisture/air&#8208;sensitive organometallics, can be protected within the unique environment of a supramolecular gel, facilitating their use in ambient conditions, potentially opening up the use of such species to nonspecialist researchers. Beyond fundamental chemistry, performing reactions in gels leads to the emerging concept of gels as &#8220;nanoreactors&#8221;. Smart chemical engineering methods are enabling the fabrication of materials and devices for use in a variety of synthetic workflows, potentially transforming the way synthesis is done. In summary, this review provides an overview of key concepts and signposts the way toward future developments of gels as active tools for reaction engineering.

         <title>Bioinspired Cationic Antimicrobial Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

A review about membrane active cationic polymers with antimicrobial properties. A focus is laid on polymeric architecture, stimuli&#8208;responsive antimicrobial polymers, as well as synergistic effects of polymers, and other compounds. 








Abstract
Antibiotics are an essential tool of modern medicine, which is critically endangered by the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Without effective antibiotics, a number of medical advancements from the last century are in jeopardy, threatening our global public health and leading to a high death toll. To counteract this development, new therapeutic strategies, that are insusceptible to resistance development have to be established. Among them, antimicrobial polymers (AP)s are a promising class of materials. Their mode&#8208;of&#8208;action is highly unspecific as they kill bacteria by membrane permeabilization or precipitation of intracellular components. As such, it is unlikely for APs to be affected by AMR. This review highlights recent advances in AP design and understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of these cationic macromolecules. One spotlight is on the polymeric architecture and how it influences AP bioactivity. A second highlight is stimuli&#8208;responsive APs and their potential to increase AP selectivity.

     alt="Bioinspired Cationic Antimicrobial Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review about membrane active cationic polymers with antimicrobial properties. A focus is laid on polymeric architecture, stimuli-responsive antimicrobial polymers, as well as synergistic effects of polymers, and other compounds. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics are an essential tool of modern medicine, which is critically endangered by the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Without effective antibiotics, a number of medical advancements from the last century are in jeopardy, threatening our global public health and leading to a high death toll. To counteract this development, new therapeutic strategies, that are insusceptible to resistance development have to be established. Among them, antimicrobial polymers (AP)s are a promising class of materials. Their mode-of-action is highly unspecific as they kill bacteria by membrane permeabilization or precipitation of intracellular components. As such, it is unlikely for APs to be affected by AMR. This review highlights recent advances in AP design and understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of these cationic macromolecules. One spotlight is on the polymeric architecture and how it influences AP bioactivity. A second highlight is stimuli-responsive APs and their potential to increase AP selectivity. Moreover, synergistic effects, e.g., between polymer and antibiotics are reviewed. The last focus is on in vivo applications of APs, which could pave a way toward clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion Transport in Ultrathin 3D Covalent Organic Framework Nanofluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work well manipulates the ion transport in nanoconfined channels by employing 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs). Owing to their continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics demonstrated high ionic flux and cation selectivity. Toward osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics output an ultrahigh power density of 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency ion transport is essential for both biological and nonbiological processes, including the regulation of cell homeostasis, energy conversion, and mass transfer in chemical industry. Nanofluidic channels are considered ideal platforms for delicate control of ion transport in their unique nanoconfinement, yet currently reported 1D and 2D nanofluidics are subjected to elevated transport resistance due to discontinuous and random channels. Here, we engineer ultrathin, 3D covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) nanofluidics featuring continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, demonstrating superior ion conductance. The energy barrier for ion transport across 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics is exceptionally low, suggesting ultrafast and low&#8208;resistance ion movements. Theoretical calculations indicate that 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics facilitate group adsorption to anions, leading to high energy barriers for anion mobility, thus enhancing ion selectivity and high&#8208;throughput cation transport. In osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics achieve a power density of 217.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 with artificial seawater and river water, potentially scalable to 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient. The proposed 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics offer new avenues for desalination and ion/molecular separation.

         <title>Functionalized Cyclic Poly(&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids) via Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of O&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic system consisting of a lanthanum complex with a sterically bulky ligand and a manganese silylamide has been developed to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) stereoregular cyclic polyesters and block copolyesters with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#393; &lt;&#160;1.1) and unique physical properties.








Abstract
Linear poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) are important degradable polymers, and they can be efficiently prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides with pendant functional groups. However, attempts to prepare cyclic poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) have been plagued by side reactions, including epimerization and uncontrolled intramolecular chain transfers or termination, that prevent the synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight stereoregular cyclic polyesters. Herein, we report a scalable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) stereoregular functionalized cyclic poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) by means of controlled polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides using a catalytic system consisting of a lanthanum complex with a sterically bulky ligand and a manganese silylamide. Additionally, using this system, we could readily prepare cyclic block poly(&#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids) by means of sequential addition of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides. The obtained cyclic polyesters and their cyclic block copolyesters exhibit distinctive physicochemical properties&#8212;including elevated phase transition temperature, improved toughness, and reduced viscosity&#8212;compared to their linear counterparts.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Photoswitchable Covalent Ligands for the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based design of a covalent photoswitchable ligand for the &#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor, a therapeutically relevant GPCR, is described. This tool facilitates the modification of the intrinsic activity of the protein by light. Computational analysis of its mechanism of action suggests that the photoswitch takes place within the binding pocket. 








Abstract
The &#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR) is a critical target for the treatment of airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To better understand its mechanism of action and study its dynamics, photoswitchable ligands provide a distinct advantage due to their ability to be activated with high spatiotemporal control. In this study, we developed a series of molecular tools featuring different combinations of pharmacophores, covalent warheads, and linker lengths. These compounds were characterized using highly specific assay protocols to evaluate their covalent binding capabilities, with the goal of identifying optimal covalently&#8208;bound photoswitches. Among these, the covalently&#8208;bound photoswitchable receptor agonist 6 exhibited a significant functional switch. To gain deeper insight into the binding thermodynamics and kinetics of this molecular tool, as well as the molecular determinants involved, we performed metadynamics (MetaD) simulations and analyzed their results using a Markov State Model (MSM) obtained by applying the Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) principle to the MetaD&#8208;derived free energies. These studies suggest that photoswitching of compound 6 occurs within the binding pocket of the &#946;2AR. Consequently, compound 6 holds promise as a valuable tool for investigating &#946;2AR activation kinetics and dynamics with high accuracy, thereby facilitating high&#8208;resolution biophysical studies.

An automated experimental workflow to accelerate the discovery of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), which is often hindered by slow, manual approaches, has been developed. Automation of the synthesis, characterization, and analysis, is supported by computational modelling to rationalize the experimental outcomes, and development of a host&#8211;guest assay elucidated trends in MOC binding behavior.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are a class of self&#8208;assembled materials with promising applications in chemical purifications, sensing, and catalysis. Their potential is, however, hampered by challenges in the targeted design of MOCs with desirable properties. MOC discovery is thus often reliant on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches and brute&#8208;force manual screening, which are time&#8208;consuming, costly, and material&#8208;intensive. Translating the synthesis and property screening of MOCs to an automated workflow is therefore attractive, to both accelerate discovery and provide the datasets crucial for data&#8208;led approaches to accelerate MOC discovery and to realize their targeted properties for specific applications. Here, an automated workflow for the streamlined assembly and property screening of MOCs was developed, incorporating automated high&#8208;throughput screening of variables pertinent to MOC synthesis, data curation and automated analysis, and development of a host&#8211;guest assay to rapidly assess binding behavior. Computational modelling supplemented this automated experimental workflow for post priori rationalization of experimental outcomes. This study lays the groundwork for future large&#8208;scale MOC screening: from a relatively modest screen of 24 precursor combinations under one set of reaction conditions, 3 clean MOC species were identified, and subsequent screening of their host&#8211;guest behavior highlighted trends in binding and the identification of potential applications in molecular separations.

         <title>Efficient Semitransparent Organic Solar Modules with Exceptional Diurnal Stability Through Asymmetric Interaction Induced by Symmetric Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetric molecular structure of 4FY has been shown to induce an &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221;, which promotes a higher degree of molecular packing than in Y6. The asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area semitransparent organic solar modules that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions. 








Abstract
The symmetry&#8208;breaking design strategy of nonfullerene acceptor can improve the performance of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs). However, no report exists on the &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221; induced by symmetric molecular structure in nonfullerene acceptors. Herein, we showcase that 2D fluorophenyl outer groups in symmetric 4FY promote dipole&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly through asymmetric molecular interactions, resulting in a tighter packed structure than Y6 with the same symmetric geometry. Such unique properties lead to high&#8208;performance layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs, accompanied by simultaneously reduced energy and recombination losses and improved charge&#8208;related characteristics. ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY achieve notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.81%, average visible transmittance of 45.43%, and light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.91%. Moreover, exceptional diurnal cycling stability is observed in the ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY with much prolonged T80 up to 134&#160;h, which is about 17 times greater than the reference PCE10&#8208;2F/Y6. Lastly, we fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar modules based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY (active area of 18 cm2), which shows PCE of 6.78% and the highest LUE of 3.10% to date for all&#8208;narrow bandgap semitransparent organic solar modules. This work demonstrates that asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area ST&#8208;OSCs that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions.

         <title>Sprayed Microdroplets Architect a Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micron&#8208;sized droplets promote rapid nucleation of metal&#8208;oxo clusters, forming polyoxometalates within sub&#8208;millisecond timescales, an outcome unattainable in the bulk phase under similar conditions, while avoiding the traditional use of corrosive chemicals, acids, and heat.








Abstract
Although many past attempts have utilized micron&#8208;sized droplets for breaking and forming organic bonds, their potential in promoting inorganic bond formation reactions remains largely unexplored. We report a promising approach to synthesizing a tungsten&#8208;based Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) in various organic and aqueous microdroplets under ambient conditions, eliminating the traditional need for hazardous or corrosive chemicals and high&#8208;boiling solvents. When aerosolized, a simple tungstate (WO42&#8722;) solution spontaneously produces a metal&#8208;oxo cluster (W6O192&#8722;), a valuable POM with broad applications, achieving yields up to 99% in less than a millisecond. Mass spectrometric detection of reactive intermediates unraveled the nucleation mechanism in microdroplets, leading to the formation of polyoxotungstate, which was then further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Empirical observations collectively suggest that rapid solvent evaporation and subsequent enrichment of reactants in the confined volume of microdroplets likely facilitate the growth of the POM through partial solvation at the air&#8211;liquid interface.

         <title>Effect of Alternating Polarity in Electrochemical Olefin Hydrocarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating polarity (AP) is a powerful tool for controlling selectivity in olefin hydrofunctionalization, but this use is underdeveloped. Using electrochemical olefin hydrocarboxylation as a model, we highlight how AP controls product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition. It hinders overreduction, limiting dicarboxylation and electrode passivation, and facilitates a unique electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) mechanism.








Abstract
The electrochemical generation of radical anions from feedstock olefins offers a selective and efficient route for synthesizing commodity chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors via hydrofunctionalization. Traditional methods for electrochemical olefin hydrofunctionalization, for example, hydrocarboxylation, rely on anion intermediates and follow an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;electrochemical&#8211;chemical (ECEC) mechanism involving olefin reduction, carboxylation, further reduction, and protonation. Enhancing terminal carboxylate selectivity often requires a proton source, reducing functional group tolerance and favoring proton reduction over olefin reduction. Alternating polarity, a nascent technique in organic electrochemistry, can improve product selectivity by influencing electron transfer rates and electrode surface species. Herein, we report the use of alternating polarity to selectively generate radical anions from styrene derivatives, using electrochemical hydrocarboxylation as a model. This approach shifts the mechanism to an electrochemical&#8211;chemical&#8211;chemical (ECC) pathway, where the final step involves hydrogen atom transfer. We showcase how alternating polarity modulates product selectivity, yield, and material decomposition, offering new insights into how alternating polarity can advance olefin functionalization by enabling more controlled and selective reaction pathways.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Ensembled Aptamers Enhance Fluid Stability in Circulating Tumor Cells Capture for Tumor Treatment Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) engineered multivalent aptamers (TEAn) with programmable ligands size and configuration, enabling high&#8208;efficiency capture of CTCs and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) clusters on cell membrane.








Abstract
The recognition and binding via receptor&#8208;ligand interactions on cell membranes often weaken in complex environments, such as whole blood samples from cancer patients, making disease diagnosis and treatment evaluation unfavorable. Constructing multivalent ligands with sufficient fluid stability in complex environments remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) ensembled multivalent aptamers (TEAn, n = 1&#8211;3) with programmable ligands size, enabling efficient capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on cell membrane. Compared to traditional aptamer approach, the dissociation constants (Kd) of TEA3 exhibits &#8764;20&#8208;fold growth in serum due to its precise size and rigid DNA framework. This high&#8208;affinity interaction significantly enhances capture efficiency by improving fluid stability of TEAn and magnetic beads complex in complex environment. In addition, this CTC detection strategy is applied for clinical tumor treatment evaluation and progress monitoring in liver cancer patient samples, achieving an accuracy of &#8764;83.3% in classifying patients as complete or partial responses (CR/PR). Overall, this strategy will strongly promote potential clinical application of DNA framework for cancer diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.

Compared to traditional aptamer approach, the dissociation constants (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) of TEA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits &#8764;20-fold growth in serum due to its precise size and rigid DNA framework. This high-affinity interaction significantly enhances capture efficiency by improving fluid stability of TEA&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and magnetic beads complex in complex environment. In addition, this CTC detection strategy is applied for clinical tumor treatment evaluation and progress monitoring in liver cancer patient samples, achieving an accuracy of &#8764;83.3% in classifying patients as complete or partial responses (CR/PR). Overall, this strategy will strongly promote potential clinical application of DNA framework for cancer diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photoactivatable Plasma Membrane Probe Based on a Self&#8208;Triggered Photooxidation Cascade for Live Cell Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we establish a new photoswitching concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC). Rhodamine dyes have mild photosensitizing properties that enable subsequent photoactivation and photobleaching of a leuco&#8208;rhodamine plasma membrane probe. Upon laser irradiation in the visible range, we successfully performed live SMLM (Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy), allowing to image the plasma membrane at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging based on the localization of single emitters requires a spatio&#8208;temporal control of the ON and OFF states. To this end, photoactivatable fluorophores are adapted as they can be turned on upon light irradiation. Here, we present a concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC) based on the photooxidation of a plasma membrane&#8208;targeted leuco&#8208;rhodamine (LRhod&#8208;PM), a non&#8208;fluorescent reduced form of a rhodamine probe. Upon visible light irradiation the small number of oxidized rhodamines, Rhod&#8208;PM, acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen capable of oxidizing the OFF state LRhod&#8208;PM thereby switching it to its ON state. We showed that this phenomenon is kinetically favored by a high local concentration and propagates quickly when the probe is embedded in membrane bilayers. In addition, we showed that the close proximity of the dyes favors the photobleaching. At the single&#8208;molecule level, the concomitant activation/bleaching phenomena allow reaching a single&#8208;molecule blinking regime enabling single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy for super&#8208;resolution of live cellular membranes and their thin processes including filopodia and tuneling nanotubes.

         <title>Selective Leaflet&#8208;Anchored DNA Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Monitoring of Juxta&#8208;Plasma Membrane Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusogenic nanoliposomes were developed to effectively anchor amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. By combining this strategy with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, precise functionalization of both membrane leaflets could be achieved, thereby enabling simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments. 








Abstract
The cell membrane functions as a bidirectional interface that coordinates the selective transport of substances and information between the interior and exterior of the cell. Simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer local environments surrounding this lipid bilayer is crucial for elucidating various cellular activities but significantly challenged by the lack of technologies capable of precisely engineering biosensing probes on both membrane leaflets. In this work, by developing fusogenic nanoliposomes with high cell fusion efficiency, we successfully anchored amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. By integrating this with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, we achieved precise functionalization of both leaflets of the cell membrane, thus enabling simultaneous monitoring of localized targets within their respective juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments, avoiding signal contamination caused by the optical diffraction limit. Using selectively dual&#8208;leaflet&#8208;anchored tetrahedral DNAzyme probes, we revealed that the transmembrane ion channel SLC41A1 synergistically modulated the influx of Na+ and the efflux of Mg2+ in live cells. With a modular design, this membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoplatform can be readily extended for the study of bilateral interface&#8208;dominant cellular processes, shifting the paradigm toward a more localized and subtle perspective.

         <title>Square Planar Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH)2 and its Role in Fast and Selective Catalytic Amine&#8211;Borane Dehydropolymerization to Form High Molecular Weight Polyaminoboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Square planar Ru(II), Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH)2 is the first species formed on simple dehydrohalogenation of RuCl2(iPr2PCH2CH2NH2)2 using tBuOK, a pre&#8208;catalyst system that promotes very fast and selective amine&#8211;borane dehydropolymerization to form high molecular weight polyaminoborane. 








Abstract
Addition of tBuOK to orange RuCl2(iPr2PCH2CH2NH2)2 forms the pink, square planar, Ru(II) complex Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH)2. This is an active catalyst (ToF 250&#160;s&#8722;1) for the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#183;NMeH2 to give high molecular weight polyaminoborane, [H2BNMeH]n (Mn&#160;=&#160;138&#8201;700&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1) at low loadings (0.03 mol%). An induction period observed is due to the initial formation of a hydroxy&#8208;hydride species, Ru(iPr2PCH2CH2NH2)2(OH)(H), prior to fast turnover.

         <title>Acridine&#8208;Substituted&#8208;Centronucleus Nonfullerene Acceptors Enables Organic Solar Cells with Over 20% Efficiency with Low Nonradiative Recombination Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three small&#8208;molecule acceptors, AQx, AQx&#8208;o&#8208;Ac, and AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac, were designed and synthesized, differing in their acridine substitutions. AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac demonstrates minimal static disorder, reduced nonradiative energy loss, and enhanced crystallization, culminating in a PCE of 18.64% in PM6:AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac OSCs. Incorporating AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac as a third component into the PM6:eC9 blend elevated the PCE of the optimal ternary system to 20.28%.








Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel strategy of introducing luminescent acridine units for central nuclear substitution in quinoxaline&#8208;based acceptor molecules (named AQx&#8208;o&#8208;Ac and AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac) to enhance their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), which can effectively improve the electroluminescent quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of OSCs and thereby suppress &#916;Enr. In addition, the substituted acridine unit accelerates molecular aggregation and optimizes molecular crystallization, effectively alleviating the static disorder of acceptor molecules and facilitating charge extraction and transport in OSCs. As a result, the PM6:AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac binary OSCs achieve an excellent PCE of 18.64% with an exceptionally low &#916;Enr of 0.166&#160;eV. To the best of our knowledge, a &#916;Enr of 0.166&#160;eV represents the lowest value reported for OSCs achieving PCEs over 18&#160;%. Finally, the acceptor AQx&#8208;m&#8208;Ac is incorporated into PM6:eC9 blend as the third component, and the optimal ternary device produces a superior PCE of 20.28%. This work highlights the potential of promoting luminescence for suppressing nonradiative energy loss and charts a viable path for upcoming breakthrough in high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.

As a result, the PM6:AQx-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-Ac binary OSCs achieve an excellent PCE of 18.64% with an exceptionally low &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.166&#160;eV. To the best of our knowledge, a &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.166&#160;eV represents the lowest value reported for OSCs achieving PCEs over 18&#160;%. Finally, the acceptor AQx-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-Ac is incorporated into PM6:eC9 blend as the third component, and the optimal ternary device produces a superior PCE of 20.28%. This work highlights the potential of promoting luminescence for suppressing nonradiative energy loss and charts a viable path for upcoming breakthrough in high-efficiency organic photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Method for Constructing Nucleosome Arrays with Spatially Defined Histone PTMs and DNA Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work advances methodology by addressing challenges in mimicking the complex in vivo spatial relationships of histone acetylation and DNA damage. The combination of an abiotic/enzymatic hybrid catalyst system (ABEHCS) and the plug&#8208;and&#8208;play method has constituted a versatile platform to construct nucleosome arrays with precise histone acetylation and DNA damage patterns. 








Abstract
DNA damage repair mechanisms, such as base excision repair (BER), safeguard cells against genotoxic agents that cause genetic instability and diseases, including cancer. In eukaryotic nuclei, DNA within nucleosome arrays is less accessible to repair factors than naked DNA owing to the structural constraints of chromatin. Histone acetylation is crucial for loosening the chromatin structure and facilitating access to damaged DNA, yet its effects&#8212;particularly in histone globular domains&#8212;on BER in nucleosome arrays remain unexplored. Herein, we employ an abiotic/enzymatic hybrid catalyst system (ABEHCS) and a plug&#8208;and&#8208;play strategy to regioselectively introduce histone acetylation and deoxycytidine&#8208;to&#8208;deoxyuridine DNA damage. This approach enables the construction of nucleosome arrays with diverse spatial configurations of histone acetylation and DNA lesions, similar to those found in living organisms. Our findings reveal that H3K56 acetylation in the histone globular domain enhances BER efficiency mediated by UDG and APE1 in nucleosome arrays, contingent upon the spatial relationship between H3K56Ac and the DNA damage site.

         <title>Application of Molecular Ferroelectric in Photocatalytic Selective Oxidization of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

The molecular ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) achieves a remarkable 104&#8208;fold enhancement in alkane oxidation activity compared to BaTiO3, with a turnover number (TON) of 6286 under light and ultrasound. Its built&#8208;in electric field enables efficient charge separation, while synergistic effects drive reactive oxygen species generation, highlighting its promising application in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics utilize metal nodes and organic groups as catalytic active sites, with the surrounding ferroelectric polarization significantly enhancing catalytic activity and showcasing tremendous application potential. However, their application in photocatalysis remains underexplored. This study presents the first investigation of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) as a photocatalyst for alkane oxidation. Under the combined effects of light and ultrasound, this catalyst exhibited a notable turnover number (TON) of 6286&#160;&#177;&#160;491, which is 104 times higher than that of inorganic ferroelectrics like barium titanate (BaTiO3). The molecular ferroelectric exhibits excellent recyclability, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies indicate that the built&#8208;in electric field within the molecular ferroelectric facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers, thereby enhancing its ferroelectric photocatalytic activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results further reveal that the synergistic effects of light and ultrasound effectively generate reactive oxygen species. These findings underscore the unique advantages of molecular ferroelectrics compared to rigid inorganic counterparts, including their distinctive structural features and finely tunable catalytic performance, highlighting their potential for developing homogeneous, precisely active sites and efficient photocatalysts. This research lays the foundation for the broader application of molecular ferroelectrics in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>New Transferrin Receptor&#8208;Targeting Conjugate Effectively Delivers DNA to Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel RNA aptamer targeting the transferrin receptor (TfR), conjugated with DSPE lipid, which achieves remarkably efficient brain uptake, reaching brain&#8208;to&#8208;serum ratios as high as 6.5. Through fluorescence imaging and polymerase&#8208;chain reaction analyses, we verify that this new conjugate successfully delivers a substantial amount of DNA oligonucleotide to the brains of Balb/cJ mice and demonstrates effectiveness in a human blood&#8211;brain barrier cell line model. 








Abstract
Delivery across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) is one of the most challenging tasks for modern biopharmaceutics. Many attempts have been taken, with only low delivery efficacies achieved so far. We report a new transferrin receptor&#8208;targeting (TfR) RNA aptamer conjugated to DSPE lipid that leads to an unprecedented effective uptake in the brain, with brain&#8208;to&#8208;serum ratios up to 6.5 in mice. This result is superior to recently published values of &lt;&#160;1 for antibody conjugates and nanovesicles, pointing to a successful combined effect of the increased lipophilicity and TfR targeting with the new RNA aptamer that our conjugate provides. Using fluorescence whole body imaging, polymerase&#8208;chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we confirm that the new conjugate delivers high amounts of DNA oligonucleotide to brains of Balb/cJ mice, and it is effective in human cells. There is no acute toxicity as verified with histopathological assessment of mice organs. The combination of properties demonstrated by our new conjugate makes it a highly potent delivery tool that can be applied in therapy of brain diseases incl. glioblastoma, neurogenerative diseases, and a broad range of brain infections.

         <title>A Capping&#8208;assisted Strategy for Synthesis of Glass&#8208;like Carboxylate&#8208;based Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis strategy depending on capping effect was proposed for preparing glass&#8208;like coordination polymers for the first time. The prepared glassy coordination polymers possessed excellent mechanical properties and fraction resistance comparable with ceramics and plastic&#8208;like resilience.








Abstract
The direct preparation of glass&#8208;like carboxylate&#8208;based coordination polymers (CPs) possessing continuous internal structure and transparency is challenging due to the lack of control on coordination kinetics and subsequently the range of order. Herein, a capping&#8208;assisted strategy was presented to control the molecular assembly during the metal&#8208;ligand coordination in the solution and to inhibit the long&#8208;range of order hence building glass&#8208;like CPs (g&#8208;CPs) mimicking the polymerization process. 1,3,5&#8208;benzene tricarboxylate (BTC) ligand was used to connect the copper cations (Cu2+) into metal&#8208;organic complexes of different Cu: BTC ratios (metal&#8208;organic pool) in presence of an excess of triethyl amine as a capping agent. Concentrating the Cu&#8208;BTC complexes and further drying under mild conditions induced the decapping process which triggered the random crosslinking between the free carboxylate and Cu2+ to form a boundary&#8208;free continuous internal structure. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;BTC g&#8208;CP exhibited an approximately similar fine structure like its crystalline counterpart (HKUST&#8208;1), which facilitated solvent and thermal&#8208;induced crystallization. Due to the internal structure continuity, the g&#8208;CP possesses ceramic&#8208;like hardness and wear resistance and plastic&#8208;like resilience. This capping&#8208;assisted strategy has been successfully extended to Ni&#8208;BTC and Fe&#8208;BTC systems under mild conditions and thus presenting a general method for the formation of glass&#8208;like carboxylate&#8208;based CPs.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Controlled, Sequential Self&#8208;Sorting of Supramolecular Assemblies in Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

A redox reaction&#8208;mediated transient deactivation strategy has been employed to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular structures in solution and inside model protocells&#8212;an unprecedented architecture in the field.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting of cellular components is essential for maintaining order and function in living systems, enabling complex processes to operate seamlessly. Emulating such self&#8208;sorting in synthetic self&#8208;assembly, however, has conventionally relied on structural or chirality mismatches of monomers yielding self&#8208;sorted systems under thermodynamic conditions. In contrast, reaction&#8208;coupled, kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly, ubiquitous in biological systems, is critical for achieving spatiotemporal characteristics. Extending this principle to temporally self&#8208;sorted synthetic assemblies is key to developing multi&#8208;component biomimetic systems. Herein, we present a strategy towards this direction, to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular assemblies through differences in the chemical&#8208;reactivity of monomers, coupled to redox&#8208;reactions. This approach exploits the distinct redox potentials of monomers to achieve precise temporal&#8208;control over self&#8208;sorting, while inherent structural mismatches among monomers ensure the kinetic stability of self&#8208;sorted state. Reduction reactions transiently disrupt their assemblies into dormant inactive monomeric states, while subsequent kinetically controlled reassembly occurs via reversible oxidation reactions. Finally, utilizing this sequential self&#8208;sorting, we aim to mimic multicomponent cellular self&#8208;organization by demonstrating the kinetically controlled growth of self&#8208;sorted structures in the presence of model protocells, using lipid vesicles as compartments. Although spatial&#8208;distribution remains non&#8208;selective, the dormant monomeric states facilitate monomer encapsulation and the unprecedented stepwise&#8208;formation of self&#8208;sorted assemblies within model protocells.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Aromatic Lactones into Bioisosteres by Carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;Boranol Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed group&#8208;exchange strategy has been developed for the direct conversion of aromatic lactones into cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate broad functional&#8208;group compatibility and the synthetic value of this strategy. Furthermore, the application of this methodology to the rapid modification of lactone cores in bioactive molecules underscores its practical utility.








Abstract
Bioisosteric replacement is an important strategy in drug discovery and is commonly practiced in medicinal chemistry; however, the incorporation of bioisosteres typically requires laborious multistep de novo synthesis. The direct conversion of a functional group into its corresponding bioisostere is of particular significance in evaluating structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;exchange strategy that enables the direct conversion of aromatic lactones, a prevalent motif in bioactive molecules, into their corresponding cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate the synthetic value and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility of this strategy, while the application of this methodology to the rapid remodeling of chromenone cores in bioactive molecules highlights its utility.

         <title>Design and Construction of D&#8208;A&#8208;Extended 3D Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study successfully developed three distinct 3D extended D&#8208;A COFs with a pyr topology by employing a newly designed intrinsic D&#8208;A type building block. Among these, the A&#8208;D&#8208;A structured COF stands out due to its multiple charge transfer channels in 3D space, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. This finding provides valuable insights into designing extended D&#8208;A constructs within 3D frameworks to optimize photocatalytic performance. 








Abstract
The development of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Although most studies have concentrated on 2D COFs, research into their 3D counterparts remains limited. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized a carbazoyl dicyanobenzene derivative (TBFCC) as an intrinsic D&#8208;A building block. By selecting TAPA, TAPB, and TAPT as the donor, acceptor&#8208;&#960;, and acceptor donors, respectively, we synthesized three distinct D&#8208;A&#8208;extended COF materials: D&#8208;D&#8208;A, A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;A, and A&#8208;D&#8208;A. Among these, 3D&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF, featuring an A&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 31.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported 3D COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This superior performance is attributed to its A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration, which provides multiple charge transfer pathways in 3D space, overcoming the electron transport limitations inherent in 2D COFs. Consequently, this feature facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charges within the framework and reduces carrier recombination, thereby optimizing photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Decoding the Chemical Language of Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides from the Untapped Archaea Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary metabolites (SMs) are essential across all life domains, yet those originating from the Archaea domain remain poorly understood. Here, the systematic genome mining and the pioneering heterologous expression of archaeal SMs have revealed the chemical landscape of archaeal lanthipeptides, showing both canonical and non&#8208;canonical forms. These lanthipeptides exhibit antagonistic activity and activate the host's motility, likely shaping the archaeal community and mediating environmental adaptation.








Abstract
Chemical communication is crucial in ecosystems with complex microbial communities. However, the difficulties inherent to the cultivation of archaea have led to a limited understanding of their chemical language, especially regarding the structure diversity and function of secondary metabolites (SMs). Our in&#8208;depth exploration into the biosynthetic potential of archaea has unveiled the previously unexplored biosynthetic capabilities and chemical diversity of archaeal ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Through the first application of heterologous expression in archaeal SM discovery, we have identified 24 lanthipeptides, including a distinctive type featuring diamino&#8208;dicarboxylic termini. It highlights the uniqueness of archaeal biosynthetic pathways and significantly expands the chemical landscape of archaeal SMs. Additionally, archaeal lanthipeptides demonstrate antagonistic activity against haloarchaea, mediating the unique biotic interaction in the halophilic niche. They showcase a new ecological role of RiPPs in enhancing the host's motility by inducing the rod&#8208;shaped cell morphology and upregulating the archaellin gene expression, facilitating the archaeal interaction with abiotic environments. These discoveries broaden our understanding of archaeal chemical language and provide promising prospects for future exploration of SM&#8208;mediated interaction.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells via Multi&#8208;Functionalized Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We specifically introduced a 4&#8208;BBA molecule into the perovskite film to form a multifunctional bridging structure anchored with the SAM layer, which passivated Pb2+ ion defects and regulated crystallization of the perovskite film, enhancing interfacial contact and releasing residual strain. The resultant f&#8208;PSCs achieved a high PCE of 25.30% (25.13% certified) with a record VOC of 1.21&#160;V. 








Abstract
Inverted flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are promising candidates for mechanical photovoltaic applications due to their ease of preparation, lightweight, and portability. However, the weak interface connections, residual strain, and the nonradiative recombination loss among adjacent layers are critical challenges that restrict f&#8208;PSCs development. To address these issues, a functionalized molecule with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors, 4&#8208;Carboxyphenylboronic acid (4&#8208;BBA), is designed in the perovskite precursor for modulating perovskite crystallization, which achieves uniform and stress&#8208;relaxation perovskite film and forms a robust bridging structure anchored at the buried interface. Theoretical calculation and experimental results show that the C&#9552;O group passivates Pb2+ with I&#8722; vacancy defect through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, reducing trap&#8208;assisted recombination. Furthermore, the designed 4&#8208;BBA is preferentially deposited at the buried layer interface between the perovskite and substrate, forming hydrogen bonds with the self&#8208;assembled monolayer via B&#9472;OH bonds, creating a mechanically stable bridge between the layers. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the champion f&#8208;PSC reached 25.30% (25.13% certified). And the f&#8208;PSC open&#8208;circuit voltage set a record of 1.21V. Importantly, the unencapsulated f&#8208;PSC using 4&#8208;BBA retains 95.3% of its original performance after 5000 cycles at a bending radius of 10mm, demonstrating extraordinary bending stability.

&lt;p&gt;We specifically introduced a 4-BBA molecule into the perovskite film to form a multifunctional bridging structure anchored with the SAM layer, which passivated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion defects and regulated crystallization of the perovskite film, enhancing interfacial contact and releasing residual strain. The resultant f-PSCs achieved a high PCE of 25.30% (25.13% certified) with a record &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.21&#160;V. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverted flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) are promising candidates for mechanical photovoltaic applications due to their ease of preparation, lightweight, and portability. However, the weak interface connections, residual strain, and the nonradiative recombination loss among adjacent layers are critical challenges that restrict f-PSCs development. To address these issues, a functionalized molecule with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors, 4-Carboxyphenylboronic acid (4-BBA), is designed in the perovskite precursor for modulating perovskite crystallization, which achieves uniform and stress-relaxation perovskite film and forms a robust bridging structure anchored at the buried interface. Theoretical calculation and experimental results show that the C&#9552;O group passivates Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; vacancy defect through Lewis acid-base interactions, reducing trap-assisted recombination. Furthermore, the designed 4-BBA is preferentially deposited at the buried layer interface between the perovskite and substrate, forming hydrogen bonds with the self-assembled monolayer via B&#9472;OH bonds, creating a mechanically stable bridge between the layers. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the champion f-PSC reached 25.30% (25.13% certified). And the f-PSC open-circuit voltage set a record of 1.21V. Importantly, the unencapsulated f-PSC using 4-BBA retains 95.3% of its original performance after 5000 cycles at a bending radius of 10mm, demonstrating extraordinary bending stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangements of the Alkaloid Intermediate Geissoschizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
19E&#8208;geissoschizine is a key precursor in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Using enzymatic assays and gene silencing, three CYPs were identified from C. roseus that oxidize this compound to four alkaloid scaffolds: strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline, and mavacurane. Mutational analysis reveals how active&#8208;site changes fine&#8208;tune product specificity, highlighting nature's strategy for metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Plants can generate structural diversity by enzymatic rearrangement of a central intermediate. 19E&#8208;geissoschizine is one such chemically versatile intermediate that plays a central role in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Here we report how 19E&#8208;geissoschizine undergoes oxidative transformations to generate four distinct alkaloid scaffolds through the action of three biosynthetic enzymes. Using in vitro enzymatic assays and gene silencing, we demonstrate how these three cytochrome P450 enzymes in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus transform 19E&#8208;geissoschizine into strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline&#8208;type, and mavacurane&#8208;type alkaloids. We use mutational analysis to show how minimal changes to the active site of these similar enzymes modulate product specificity. This work highlights how substrate reactivity and enzyme mutations work synergistically to generate chemical diversity.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) compounds remains a challenging task. Here, we present the first enantioselective intermolecular hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction between aromatic alkenes and TFMS, catalyzed by chiral salen&#8208;Co complexes. This approach efficiently yields a variety of chiral benzylic&#160;trifluoromethoxy compounds with 75%&#8211;99% ee.








Abstract
The construction of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) compounds continues to present challenges due to limited enantioselectivity&#8208;control or the necessity for OCF3&#8208;containing substrates in the only two previous reports. Herein, we have developed a salen&#8208;Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction involving aromatic alkenes and trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS). This method effectively produces a range of chiral benzyl trifluoromethoxy compounds with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 75% to 99%.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Based Galvanic Potentiometric Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Serotonin Signaling Under Psychosocial Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorothioate aptamer&#8208;based galvanic redox potentiometric sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity enables real&#8208;time monitoring of serotonin in a mouse model of psychosocial stress. It reveals, for the first time, a distinct correlation between serotonin release and social hierarchy, with higher serotonin levels in dominant mice.








Abstract
Psychosocial stress, a pervasive factor in mental health disorders, is tightly linked to serotonin (5&#8208;HT) dysregulation. Real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of 5&#8208;HT in vivo is challenged by interference from vitamin C (Vc) and biofouling, requiring invasive pretreatments. We present a self&#8208;powered aptamer&#8208;engineered galvanic sensor (aptGRP5&#8208;HT) that integrates phosphorothioate aptamers with a redox potentiometric mechanism, achieving 21.5&#8208;fold higher selectivity and 98.3&#8208;fold enhanced sensitivity against Vc over conventional sensors while resisting electrochemical biofouling. The aptGRP5&#8208;HT operates in complex biological environments without pretreatment, enabling direct monitoring in a rodent psychosocial stress model. Using this tool, we uncover a neurochemical signature of social hierarchy: high&#8208;ranking mice exhibit elevated 5&#8208;HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with region&#8208;specific correlations to neuronal activity&#8208;reduced spontaneous firing in the mPFC and increased activity in the DRN. This work resolves long&#8208;standing challenges in neurochemical sensing and establishes aptGRP5&#8208;HT as a transformative platform for probing brain function and stress&#8208;related disorders.

         <title>Self&#8208;Optimized Reconstruction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Introduces Cation Vacancies for Selective Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation vacancy engineering was employed to tune the electronic and surface structures of the materials, thereby inhibiting further O&#9472;O bond breakage, which leads to excellent 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance under industrial current density for continuous output of ultra&#8208;high H2O2 concentrations in excess of 8 wt%. This work is expected to provide illuminating insights for the development of efficient 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway represents a green production process that has gained increasing importance. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of efficacious catalysts to attain high activity under industrial current density. In this study, we present a strategy for cation vacancy generation through metal&#8211;organic frameworks self&#8208;optimized reconfiguration for the efficient electrosynthesis of H2O2 under industrial current densities in solid&#8208;electrolyte cell. The ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo electrocatalyst exhibits significant H2O2 selectivity of 97.8%, and the H2O2 productivity is up to 24.53&#160;mol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with a direct and continuous output of &#8764;3.36 wt% H2O2 aqueous solutions under industrial current density (400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). Impressively, the ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 220&#160;h and can output H2O2 aqueous solution with a concentration of &#8764;8.03 wt% in the pilot experiment. Theoretical calculations confirm that the introduction of modest cation vacancies optimizes the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate and reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, thus balancing the selectivity of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction. This work provides valuable insights into the rapid, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of H2O2 and the rational design of highly active catalysts.

Theoretical calculations confirm that the introduction of modest cation vacancies optimizes the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate and reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, thus balancing the selectivity of the two-electron oxygen reduction. This work provides valuable insights into the rapid, eco-friendly synthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the rational design of highly active catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Spatial Transcriptomics on the Same Cancer Tissues to Identify RNA&#8211;Metabolite Correlations</title>

Innovations in spatial omics have advanced disease research, but spatial transcriptomics (ST) and spatial metabolomics remain separate. We present a novel method integrating DESI&#8208;MSI spatial metabolomics and Visium&#8208;ST on the same tissue sections while preserving RNA quality and data integrity. Applied to breast and lung cancer tissue, this approach reveals new metabolite&#8208;transcript correlations in cancer regions, enhancing spatial multi&#8208;omics discoveries. 








Abstract
Innovations in spatial omics technologies applied to human tissues have led to breakthrough discoveries in various diseases, including cancer. Two of these approaches&#8212;spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics&#8212;have blossomed independently, fueled by technologies such as spatial transcriptomics (ST) and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Although powerful, these technologies only offer insights into the spatial distributions of restricted classes of molecules and have not yet been integrated to provide more holistic insights into biological questions. These techniques can be performed on adjacent serial sections from the same sample, but section&#8208;to&#8208;section variability can convolute data integration. We present a novel method combining desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI&#8208;MSI) spatial metabolomics and Visium spatial transcriptomics on the same tissue sections. We show that RNA quality is maintained after performing DESI&#8208;MSI on a tissue under ambient conditions and that ST data is unperturbed following DESI&#8208;MSI. We demonstrate this workflow on human breast and lung cancer tissues and identify novel correlations between metabolites and mRNA transcripts in cancer&#8208;specific tissue regions.

         <title>Regiospecific Halogenation Modulates Molecular Dipoles in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, through regiospecific bromination on a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole, we study the properties related to intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in the molecular dipole of the derived SAM molecules. Bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with the dense assembly promoted by enhanced intermolecular interactions and synergistic effects of stronger crystallinity, JJ26 efficiently modulates the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhances the stability of SAM under external pressure. The OSC device adopting JJ26 demonstrates significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. 








Abstract
Halogenated carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;extraction materials in conventional organic solar cells (OSCs). While halogenation helps optimize the molecular dipole, intermolecular interactions, and energetics of SAM, the highly polarizable carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be reactive and prone to photocleavage depending on their regiochemistry. Herein, we study the regiospecific properties, including the intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in molecular dipole of the brominated SAM molecules by brominating a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole. Additionally, a correlation between the intrinsic molecular stability and the derived SAM surface stability is established to determine the performance and stability of the OSCs. Notably, the bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with dense assembly promoted by the synergistically enhanced intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, JJ26 can efficiently modulate the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhance the stability of SAM under external stress. Consequently, the JJ26 derived OSC shows significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. This work shows that the precise modulation of the regiochemistry of SAM molecules is critical for improving their quality and derived device performance.

         <title>Predator&#8211;Prey Behavior of Droplets Propelling Through Self&#8208;Generated Channels in Crystalline Surfactant Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline layer is formed by an amphiphilic decylamine surfactant at the air/water interface. Aldehyde&#8208;containing ester oil droplets self&#8208;propel by consuming amines from the crystalline layer, thereby generating open channels along which myelin&#8208;forming amphiphile droplets chase and ultimately catch the aldehyde droplets in a predator&#8211;prey analogy.








Abstract
Motile droplets provide an attractive platform for liquid matter&#8208;based applications and protocell analogues displaying life&#8208;like features. The functionality of collectively operating droplets increases by the advance of well&#8208;designed (physico)chemical systems directing droplet&#8211;droplet interactions. Here, we report a strategy based on crystalline surfactant layers at air/water interfaces, which sustain the propulsion of floating droplets and at the same time shape the paths for other droplets attracted by them. First, we show how decylamine forms a closed, crystalline layer that remains at the air/water interface. Second, we demonstrate how aldehyde&#8208;based oil droplets react to decylamine in the crystalline layer by forming an imine, causing the droplets to move through the layer while leaving behind an open channel (comparable to &#8220;Pac&#8208;Man&#8221;). Third, we introduce tri(ethylene glycol) monododecylether (C12E3) droplets in the crystalline layer. The crystalline layer suppresses the motion of the C12E3 droplets, however, the aldehyde droplets create surface tension gradients upon depletion of surfactants from the air/water interface, thereby driving Marangoni flows that attract the C12E3 droplets as well as the myelin filaments they grow: Causing the C12E3 droplets to chase, and ultimately catch, the aldehyde droplets along the channels they have created, featuring a predator&#8208;prey analogy established at an air/water interface.

         <title>Mn(II)&#8208;Based Hybrid Halide Ionogel Scintillator Film for Large&#8208;Area and High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
We propose a versatile approach for the rapid synthesis of luminescent Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#8208;IG) by in situ forming zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during monomer polymerization. The Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (with transmittance approaching 90% at 550&#8211;1100&#160;nm) and uniform, high&#8208;efficiency emission. Leveraging its processability, we have fabricated an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillating film and successfully achieved large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. This simple and rapid synthesis method on ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators and also opens up a new avenue for the in situ construction of uniform 0D halide&#8208;polymer composites.








Abstract
Functionalized ionogels have attracted significant attention in chemical design of new materials and versatile applications, which are formed by polymer network as a matrix with introducing ionic liquids containing characteristic units as a dispersion medium. Here, we present an universal scheme to rapidly synthesize luminescent ionogels through the in situ formation of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during the polymerization of monomer. In particular, Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#9472;IG) were formed by incorporating [C20H20P]+ cations and [MnBr4]2&#8722; anions into the polymer network structure. Thanks to the amorphous nature of Mn&#8208;IG and the homogeneous distribution of self&#8208;trapped [MnBr4]2&#8722; light&#8208;emitting units with [C20H20P]+ cations, Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (nearly 90% transmittance at 550&#160;nm&#8208;1100&#160;nm) and homogeneous highly&#8208;efficient emission. Taking advantage of its processability, we fabricate an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillation film and successfully realize large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The straightforward and rapid synthesis method on such ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process&#8208;demand preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators, and also opens up new routes for the in situ construction of uniform 0D metal halide polymer composites.

&lt;p&gt;Functionalized ionogels have attracted significant attention in chemical design of new materials and versatile applications, which are formed by polymer network as a matrix with introducing ionic liquids containing characteristic units as a dispersion medium. Here, we present an universal scheme to rapidly synthesize luminescent ionogels through the in situ formation of zero-dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during the polymerization of monomer. In particular, Mn(II)-based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#9472;IG) were formed by incorporating [C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;P]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and [MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions into the polymer network structure. Thanks to the amorphous nature of Mn-IG and the homogeneous distribution of self-trapped [MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; light-emitting units with [C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;P]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (nearly 90% transmittance at 550&#160;nm-1100&#160;nm) and homogeneous highly-efficient emission. Taking advantage of its processability, we fabricate an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillation film and successfully realize large-area and high-resolution X-ray imaging. The straightforward and rapid synthesis method on such ionogels paves the way for the low-process-demand preparation of large-area scintillators, and also opens up new routes for the in situ construction of uniform 0D metal halide polymer composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Arylthianthrenium Salts with (Hetero)aryl (Pseudo)halides via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing complex arylthianthrenium salts and readily available (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides as starting materials, in conjunction with hypoboric acid as a reductant, structurally diverse (hetero)biaryl motifs can be rapidly synthesized via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Key to this advance is the selective and mild borylation of arylthianthrenium salts, followed by a conventional SMC (Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling) reaction with aryl halides.








Abstract
Herein, we present a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of arylthianthrenium salts at a late stage with diverse (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides under reductive conditions, in which a palladium(0) catalyst differentiates between two aryl electrophiles based on the different rates of oxidative addition of arylthianthrenium salts and aryl halides for selective umpolung. A measured near&#8208;zero Hammett rho value is consistent with oxidative addition of the arylthianthrenium salts to palladium(0) being insensitive to substituent effects, which enables reaction with structurally and electronically diverse arylthianthrenium salts. In addition, we show the robustness of this method by coupling of two complex fragments that would otherwise be difficult to access in a single step.

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose Toward Propyl&#8208; or Propenyl&#8208;Substituted Monomers and Mechanistic Understanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol solvolyzed lignin followed by simultaneous cleavage of C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bond enables valorization of native lignin in biomass toward prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (79.6% selectivity) and propyl (81.7% selectivity) substituted monomers under N2 and H2 atmosphere, respectively.








Abstract
Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru0.8/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oils (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4&#8208;propylguaiacol and 4&#8208;propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H2 pressure and using methanol as the solvent. But, under N2 atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)guaiacol and 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol&#8208;extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH at the monomeric level. Thus, this work provided novel insights into the reaction pathway of (native) lignin depolymerization.

         <title>A Novel Tandem Reaction System for High&#8208;Concentration Acetic Acid Production from Methane and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a plasma&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalytic tandem system, optimizing plasma processes in a self&#8208;designed reactor to achieve 68.0% methane conversion and 5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 methanol concentration. A hydrophobic ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S catalyst minimized byproduct effects, enabling 52.0% acetic acid selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentration, three orders of magnitude higher than traditional methods, meeting industrial criteria and advancing efficient methane utilization. 








Abstract
Directly converting methane into high&#8208;value products like CH3COOH poses significant challenges owing to the kinetic limitations of C&#9472;H activation and C&#9472;C coupling in traditional single&#8208;catalysis methods. This work systematically studied the compatibility and effectiveness of plasma and thermocatalytic tandem systems. By optimizing the plasma process in a self&#8208;designed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, we enhanced methane conversion (68.0%), methanol concentration (5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1), and CO selectivity (56.9%), while preventing carbon deposition and CO2 formation. In subsequent thermocatalysis, we developed the stearic acid&#8208;modified ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S hydrophobic catalyst to avoid the separation of methanol and CO from the mixture and minimize the influence of by&#8208;products (e.g., H2O). This innovative approach achieved 52.0% CH3COOH selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentrations, three orders of magnitude than traditional methods, meeting the preliminary industrial criteria. This study demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis, offering valuable insights for the efficient utilization of methane and other challenging catalytic reactions.

         <title>Superfast Protein Desulfurization Triggered by Low&#8208;Energy Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) has been developed to enable superfast and clean desulfurization under exceptionally mild conditions. The utility of LEnVLD was demonstrated through the clean desulfurization of a wide range of peptide and protein substrates, and its convenience and robustness facilitated the application of LEnVLD in versatile reaction scenarios such as solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization.








Abstract
The combination of transthioesterification&#8208;based ligation of thiol&#8208;derived amino acids and the post&#8208;ligation desulfurization has greatly expanded the scope of modern chemical protein synthesis. Here, we report a new strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) that enables superfast and clean protein desulfurization (half life =&#160;1.7&#160;s) with improved reaction selectivity compared to the previous methods. The LEnVLD method can be easily carried out under very mild conditions using only a catalytic amount of fluorescent dye and household flashlight (ca. 5&#160;W) irradiation, eliminating the need for any pyrophoric reagent, thiol additives, or excessive radical initiators, and its practicality was demonstrated by the fast and high&#8208;yielding desulfurization of more than 30 peptide and protein substrates bearing a variety of sensitive functional groups (e.g., Thz, N&#8208;alkylated maleimide, and thioester). Moreover, the convenience and robustness of LEnVLD enable its extension to versatile reaction scenarios (e.g., solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization) that would enhance the practical capability of chemical protein synthesis.

         <title>Tandem Biocatalysis to Generate Hydrogen Sulfide and Promote Endogenous Antioxidant Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy where we integrated spatially and temporally controlled catalysis in one system to promote antioxidant response is reported. We developed a glycoconjugate that is cleaved sequentially by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST) to produce potent antioxidants persulfide and hydrogen sulfide, and this compound was found to mitigate inflammation in an animal model.








Abstract
Promoting cellular protective responses during oxidative stress conditions through the generation of antioxidant persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we report a bioinspired glycoconjugate, a candidate for tandem biocatalysis and generates persulfide/ H2S in response to oxidative stress. The glycoconjugate is cleaved by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, an enzyme that is expressed during oxidative stress; the product of this reaction is a substrate for 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme that is involved in persulfide/ H2S biosynthesis. The catalytic systems are orthogonal to one another, and the glycoconjugate is efficiently cleaved by these enzymes to generate the potent antioxidant glutathione persulfide as well as H2S. We demonstrate the efficacy of this conjugate in mitigating inflammation in the brain in an animal model. Together, using rationally designed substrates and fully catalytic steps, we leverage tandem biocatalysis to direct the generation of persulfide/ H2S, and promote cells&#8217; own antioxidant response.

         <title>Plastic from CO2, Water, and Electricity: Tandem Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and Thermochemical Ethylene&#8208;CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new system of generating entirely CO2&#8208;generated abiotic polymers by integrating electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) and organometallic polymerization catalysis is presented, having an overall CO2&#8208;to&#8208;polymer conversion of 14% and current&#8208;to&#8208;polymer efficiency of 51%. A strategy for tuning the product composition obtained from eCO2R by combining different electrocatalysts is introduced. CO&#8208;ethylene copolymerization activity in the presence of potential poisons from eCO2R is retained.








Abstract
Converting CO2 into industrially useful products is an appealing strategy for utilization of an abundant chemical resource. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) offers a pathway to convert CO2 into CO and ethylene, using renewable electricity. These products can be efficiently copolymerized by organometallic catalysts to generate polyketones. However, the conditions for these reactions are very different, presenting the challenge of coupling microenvironments typically encountered for the transformation of CO2 into highly complex but desirable multicarbon products. Herein, we present a system to produce polyketone plastics entirely derived from CO2 and water, where both the CO and C2H4 intermediates are produced by eCO2R. In this system, a combination of Cu and Ag gas diffusion electrodes is used to generate a gas mixture with nearly equal concentrations of CO and C2H4, and a recirculatory CO2 reduction loop is used to reach concentrations of above 11% each, leading to a current&#8208;to&#8208;polymer efficiency of up to 51% and CO2 utilization of 14%.

         <title>Spherical Nucleic Acids&#8208;Directed Cryosynthesis of Manganese Nanoagents for Tumor Imaging and Therapy</title>

DNA&#8208;templated theranostic manganese nanoparticles synthesized under liquid nitrogen show features of magnetic resonance imaging, gene silencing, and chemodynamic therapy for tumors.








Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based theranostic nanotechnologies that can respond to specific tumor pathophysiological parameters hold great promise for tumor diagnostics and effective treatments. However, their clinical translation is hindered by insufficient intracellular availability of essential metal cofactors required for DNAzyme activation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy for fabricating multifunctional DNA&#8208;templated manganese carbonate nanoparticles (DtMnP). The process involves three critical phases: (i) spherical nucleic acid hybrids, DNAzyme&#8208;functionalized AuNPs, serve as scaffolds for spatially controlled Mn2+ deposition through phosphate coordination, initiating heterogeneous nucleation of MnCO3; (ii) rapid liquid nitrogen freezing induces nanoparticle growth along DNA templates; and (iii) lyophilization&#8208;mediated structural stabilization enables convenient long&#8208;term storage. The DtMnP exhibits pH&#8208;responsive dissolution, releasing 90% of Mn2+ within 60&#160;min under tumor microenvironment conditions (pH 5.5). The released Mn2+ ion enables dual functionality: (i) superior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast of MCF&#8208;7 xenograft models with enhanced biosafety, and (ii) synergistic therapeutic efficacy through DNAzyme&#8208;mediated EGR&#8208;1 gene silencing (60% mRNA downregulation) combined with Mn2+&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (45% apoptosis in MCF&#8208;7 cells). The cryo&#8208;encapsulated DtMnP exemplifies a flexible and efficient approach for integrating various functional components into a single nanoparticle for tumor theranostic applications.

         <title>Nitrogen Insertion via Asymmetric Condensation and Chirality Transfer: A Stereodivergent Entry to Cyanocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyanocyclopropanes is achieved via asymmetric nitrogen insertion into prochiral cyclobutanones. Key mechanistic steps involve an organocatalyzed asymmetric condensation followed by chirality transfer via an intercepted Neber rearrangement. The reaction can be conducted in a one&#8208;pot, stereodivergent manner, allowing access to all possible cyclopropane isomers with precise control of stereochemistry.








Abstract
The condensation of prochiral cyclobutanones and diphenylphosphinyl hydroxylamine is achieved under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Interestingly, the competing aza&#8208;Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction is completely suppressed and the axially chiral oxime esters can be isolated in excellent yield and selectivity (up to 96% yield, up to 97:3 er). Computational analysis highlights the crucial role of the Br&#248;nsted acid in facilitating a successful condensation. Building on the inherent reactivity of the corresponding oxime esters, a one&#8208;pot protocol toward cyanocyclopropanes was discovered, which establishes two consecutive stereocenters. This unusual ring contraction is triggered by strong base and permits an axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer with good enantiospecificity (up to 98% es). Fine&#8208;tuning the reaction parameters enables stereodivergent access to both diastereomers of the cyanocyclopropanes, and the utility of this method is demonstrated through the formal synthesis of the drug tasimelteon.

         <dc:description>

Abstract
As a paradigm&#8208;shifting material platform in energy catalysis, precisely engineered ordered mesoporous carbon spheres emerge as supreme metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts, outperforming conventional carbon&#8208;based counterparts through synergistic structural and electronic innovations. Herein, we architecturally design vertically aligned cylindrical mesoporous carbon spheres with atomic&#8208;level sulfur doping (S&#8208;mC) that establish unprecedented performance benchmarks in the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) to hydrogen peroxide. Systematic comparative studies reveal that the S&#8208;mC catalysts achieve exceptional H2O2 selectivity (&gt;99%) and activity at current density of &#8722;3.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free catalysts in current density. Impressively, the optimized S&#8208;mC electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 25&#160;mol&#160;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. The carbon matrix's unique sp2/sp3 hybrid network coupled with S&#8208;induced charge redistribution generates electron&#8208;deficient hotspots that selectively stabilize *OOH intermediates, as evidenced by in situ spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations. This structural&#8211;electronic synergy endows the carbon framework with metal&#8208;like catalytic efficiency while maintaining inherent advantages of chemical robustness and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The marriage of S&#8208;doping engineering with mesoscopic pore architecture control opens a new way for developing efficient carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen selective reduction to H2O2.

         <title>Short Lifetime Radical Metal Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first luminescence radical cluster was constructed with open&#8208;shell luminescent radical ligands. The spin&#8208;allowed doublet emission endows it with 100% exciton utilization and a short radiation decay lifetime on the nanosecond scale, making it suitable for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging without residual images.








Abstract
Metal clusters, an emerging class of scintillator materials, have attracted much attention owing to their inherently high X&#8208;ray absorption, mild synthesis conditions, low toxicity, strong luminescence, and large Stokes shift. However, the decay lifetime of metal clusters is usually on the order of microseconds, which is unfavorable for safety inspection, nondestructive testing, and medical imaging. Here, the open&#8208;shell luminescent radical ligand was used to construct the first radical cluster scintillator Cu2I2(L)4. The spin&#8208;allowed doublet emission of Cu2I2(L)4 theoretically enabled 100% exciton utilization and exhibited a short radiation decay lifetime on the nanosecond scale. Cu2I2(L)4 can be fabricated into a flexible scintillator screen for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a high resolution of 30.7&#160;LP mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the Cu2I2(L)4 scintillator screen has no residual images during X&#8208;ray imaging. This work reports the first luminescent metal cluster with a radical ligand and presents a new strategy for constructing short lifetime X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>A Powerful Regulator to Enhance Electrocatalytic Reaction Kinetics and Thermodynamics: The Ordered Hetero&#8208;Nanowire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator is presented, which simultaneously couples the merits of the kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis. The periodical arrangement enables the formation of the local electric field to improve mass transfer kinetics, accounting for a significant boost in MOR performance. In addition, the hetero&#8208;NWs undergo the energetically favorable non&#8208;CO pathway, which is not susceptible to the invasion of toxic carbonaceous intermediates and thus ensures long&#8208;term durability for MOR.








Abstract
Optimizing the thermodynamics of electrode reactions is a valid strategy for achieving superior electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). However, as the catalyst downsizes to the nanoscale, the influence of mass transfer kinetics is pronounced in improving electrocatalytic activity. Herein, an ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator that couples the virtues of kinetics and thermodynamics is reported. Finite element analysis demonstrates that the periodic arrangement of hetero&#8208;NWs could construct a uniform electric field, promoting the precise mass transfer of reactant molecules and accelerating the electrode reaction kinetics for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In addition, the microscopic electronic structure effect of the well&#8208;defined catalyst weakens the bonding interaction toward toxic carbonaceous intermediates, which meanwhile strengthens the adsorption of hydroxyl species, critically contributing to enhanced MOR durability. The wide generality of this regulator has been confirmed by a series of as&#8208;prepared ordered hetero&#8208;NW catalysts, which show prominent electrocatalytic performance, including relatively high mass activity, superior CO resistance, and long&#8208;term stability. Therefore, this work reveals the importance of the tandem effect of kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis, which provides valuable insights for developing customized and highly efficient catalysts for extensive applications.

         <title>A 3D Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelastic with Triclinic&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition Boosts Temperature/Pressure Dual On/Off Switchable Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D hybrid perovskite ferroelastic shows both temperature&#8208; and pressure&#8208;triggered m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase transitions at 296&#160;K and critical pressure of 0.3&#160;GPa, which enables the temperature/pressure dual stimuli induced on/off switching of birefringence between birefringence&#8208;active state in anisotropic ferroelastic P1&#175;$P{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase and birefringence&#8208;inactive state in isotropic paraelastic Fm3&#175;m$Fm{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m$ phase. Such a dual&#8208;stimuli switchable birefringence is unprecedented.








Abstract
Birefringent crystals have gained enormous attention for decades due to their unique ability to manipulate polarized light. However, achieving the fascinating on/off (active/inactive) switchable birefringence under external stimuli in crystals remains a huge challenge, and the stimuli employed have been constrained predominantly to temperature. Here, through H/F substitution, we designed a 3D hybrid double perovskite ferroelastic [C3H5FNH2]2[(NH4)Fe(CN)6] (1&#8208;F), which undergoes a m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m {\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ ferroelastic transition at 296&#160;K, with the highest possible orientation states of 24 among ferroelastic crystals. Notably, the ferroelastic phase transition of 1&#8208;F can also be triggered by pressure with a low critical pressure of &#8764;0.3&#160;GPa. More importantly, 1&#8208;F shows the unprecedented temperature/pressure dual stimuli&#8208;induced on/off switching of birefringence between the birefringence&#8208;active state in the anisotropic triclinic ferroelastic P1&#175;$P{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ phase and the birefringence&#8208;inactive state in the isotropic cubic paraelastic Fm3&#175;m$Fm{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m$ phase during the m3&#175;mF1&#175;$m{\mathrm{\bar{3}}}m{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$ ferroelastic transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of dual stimuli&#8208;induced switchable birefringence in crystals. Our work paves a new way for the switching of birefringence and sheds light on the further exploration of switchable birefringence in ferroelastics.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Celluxanthenes, Antibacterial Arylpolyene Alkaloids From Diverse Cellulose&#8208;Degrading Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and biosynthetic origin of the enigmatic &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS) from the anaerobe thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) were elucidated. YAS is a complex of unusual antibacterial arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes) that are produced by various cellulolytic anaerobes.








Abstract
Cellulose degradation by anaerobic bacteria plays an eminent role in the global carbon cycle and is a critical step in biofuel production. The anaerobic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) is particularly efficient at breaking down biomass and produces a &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS), a pigment that has been implicated in signaling and conferring higher affinity of the cellulosome to YAS&#8208;loaded cellulose. However, the nature and biosynthetic origin of YAS have remained elusive. Here, we show by isolation and structure elucidation that YAS is a complex of unusual arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes). Stable isotope labeling experiments reveal all biosynthetic building blocks for celluxanthene assembly. Through a targeted gene deletion, we identify the celluxanthene (cex) biosynthesis gene cluster and propose a biosynthetic model in which an arylpolyene generated by an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) undergoes a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion with a tryptophan&#8208;derived ketoacid to form a tetronate. Genome mining and metabolic profiling revealed that diverse cellulolytic anaerobes harbor cex gene loci and produce celluxanthene congeners. Celluxanthenes show antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including clinically relevant strains. This study solves the long&#8208;standing enigma surrounding the nature of YAS and lays the groundwork for elucidating the precise biological roles of these intricate pigments.

         <title>N&#8208;(Acyldithio)Saccharin: Design, Synthesis and Applications in Catalytic Enantioselective Disulfuration/Amination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;(Acyldithio)saccharins are a novel class of highly electrophilic disulfurating reagents. Beyond enabling the disulfuration of diverse N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and Cnucleophiles, the reagents facilitate the catalytic enantioselective disulfuration/amination of unactivated alkenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208;chiral disulfide products can be readily converted into various chiral sulfur&#8208;containing compounds.








Abstract
We have designed and successfully synthesized N&#8208;(acyldithio)saccharin, which is a highly electrophilic, bench&#8208;stable, and user&#8208;friendly disulfurating reagent. This reagent can undergo reactions with diverse N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles at room temperature. In most cases, no additional catalyst is required, and the desired disulfides were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields. With this reagent, late&#8208;stage disulfuration of pharmaceuticals and biomolecules was readily accomplished. For the first time, catalytic enantioselective disulfuration/amination of unactivated alkenes was achieved using this reagent. A series of chiral disulfides were obtained with high enantioselectivities and yields. The chiral disulfide products can be readily further transformed into chiral sulfonyl fluoride, chiral thiol, and structurally diverse disulfide products. Furthermore, we have evaluated the electrophilic reactivity of a series of disulfurating reagents based on density functional theory calculations, verifying the high reactivity of N&#8208;(acyldithio)saccharin both experimentally and theoretically.

         <title>Vacancy and Dopant Co&#8208;Constructed Active Microregion in Ru&#8211;MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 for Enhanced Acidic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ru&#8208;doped low crystalline&#8208;crystalline MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 hybrid material was designed. The region containing Ru atom and/or O vacancy is innovatively defined as the active microregion. The Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mo bonds with shorter bond lengths provide satisfactory preconditions for the electronic structure modulation of O atoms. The &#8710;GH* of electron&#8208;rich O atoms is close to 0, which can effectively enhance the catalytic activity of HER.








Abstract
Accurate identification of catalytic active regions is crucial for the rational design and construction of hydrogen evolution catalysts as well as the targeted regulation of their catalytic performance. Herein, the low crystalline&#8208;crystalline hybrid MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 with unsaturated coordination and rich defects is taken as the precursor. Through the Joule heating reaction, the Ru&#8208;doped MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 catalyst is successfully constructed. Building on the traditional view that individual atoms or vacancies act as active sites, this article innovatively proposes the theory that vacancies and doped atoms synergistically construct active microregions, and multiple electron&#8208;rich O atoms within the active microregions jointly serve as hydrogen evolution active sites. Based on X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations, there is a strong electron transfer among Ru atoms, Mo atoms, and O atoms, leading to extensive O atoms with optimized electronic structure in the active microregions. These O atoms exhibit an H* adsorption free energy close to zero, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. This work provides a brand&#8208;new strategy for the design and preparation of electrocatalytic materials and the systematic regulation of the local electronic structure of catalysts.

Entropy&#8208;driven competitive adsorption modulation in perovskite electrocatalysts enables hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries that couple sustainable energy storage and green chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries (HC&#8208;ZABs) epitomize a typical integrated energy storage and conversion device that advances green chemistry and reduces carbon emissions. However, balancing efficiency and selectivity of electrocatalytic cathodic reactions remains the bottleneck in such batteries. Herein, we address this issue by designing a high&#8208;entropy perovskite, La0.6Sr0.1Ca0.1Rb0.1Y0.1CoO3 (HE&#8208;LCO), which outperforms conventional perovskites in offering enhanced electrocatalytic activity, better selectivity, and outstanding stability for cathodic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (BAOR). Combined spectroscopy characterizations, operando measurements, and theoretic calculations reveal that the entropy&#8208;driven modulation of the second coordination sphere in HE&#8208;LCO balances the adsorption of nucleophile benzyl alcohol and OH&#8722;, while inhibiting competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on this rationalized HE&#8208;LCO electrocatalyst, HC&#8208;ZABs realized efficient energy storage and benzoic acid production, boasting a long lifespan of 900 cycles at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 6.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 per cycle. Further, practical ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale HC&#8208;ZABs demonstrated a 62.8% energy efficiency improvement and an average benzoic acid yield of 0.85&#160;g per cycle, highlighting the potential of this integrated device for simultaneous sustainable energy storage and green electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>A Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(Arylene Vinylene) for Efficient Electron Transport and Sensitive Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional poly(arylene vinylene) has been developed, exhibiting a narrow optical band gap and a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport with high charge carrier mobility toward ultrasensitive chemiresistors.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers and their layer&#8208;stacked 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks, such as 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (2D PAVs), are emerging as promising polymer semiconductors for electronics and photocatalysis. However, achieving narrow optical band gaps and efficient electron transport remains a significant challenge for this class of materials to enhance the device's performance. Here, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type 2D PAV (2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, where TBDT&#160;=&#160;thienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene and IT&#160;=&#160;s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetraone) synthesized via an Aldol&#8208;type 2D polycondensation approach. Notably, 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT benefits from an effective intralayer donor&#8211;acceptor effect, exhibiting an optical band gap of 1.15&#160;eV, the smallest among the reported 2D conjugated polymers. Density functional theory calculations reveal a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport for 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, with a strongly dispersive conduction band minimum and, thus, a small effective mass for electrons half that for holes. Additionally, terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate a high charge mobility of 26&#160;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at room temperature for the powder sample. Given the high electron&#8208;deficiency of 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT for facile electron injection from hazardous gases and the high&#8208;mobility electron&#8208;dominating transport in the material, we further fabricate chemiresistors from 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, showing ultrasensitive SO2 analyte detection with limit of detection of 0.088&#160;ppb, significantly surpassing the reported chemiresistive SO2 sensors.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Metalated 1D Perylene Diimide Carbon&#8208;Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H Activation and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

A one&#8208;dimensional ABC&#8208;stacking covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as a metal&#8208;coordination site, was synthesized. Post&#8208;synthetic cobalt metalation afforded PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co, which enhanced single oxygen (1O2) generation and electron&#8208;hole pair separation, significantly boosting its photocatalytic performance in &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H activation and CO2 reduction.








Abstract
The photocatalytic activation of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles provides a direct and efficient route to high&#8208;value &#945;&#8208;amino amides but remains challenging due to intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;metalated, one&#8208;dimensional ABC&#8208;stacking covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co), integrating perylene diimide (PDI) as a photosensitizer and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as a metal coordination site. Cobalt metalation significantly enhances photocatalytic efficiency, enabling the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H carbamoylation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles with yields of up to 91%, far surpassing its non&#8208;metalated counterpart (59%). This enhancement arises from the synergistic interplay between the PDI units and cobalt centers, which promote electron&#8208;hole pair separation and enhance singlet oxygen (1O2) generation. Moreover, PP&#8208;COF&#8208;Co exhibits a 57&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity compared to its pristine analogue. This work highlights the critical role of metalation in modulating charge dynamics within COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers insights into the development of next&#8208;generation materials for sustainable catalysis.

1,2&#8208;Azaborines serve as building blocks to enantiomerically enriched &#948;&#8208;aminoboronic esters through the development of the first enantioselective hydrogenation of a boron&#8208;containing heteroarene.








Abstract
We describe herein an iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of 1,2&#8208;azaborines to access &#948;&#8208;aminoboronic esters of potential biological importance. This method represents the first enantioselective hydrogenation of a boron&#8208;containing heteroarene and features diverse substitution patterns and wide scope. The synthetic utility of our method was demonstrated by the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;phenibut and the formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;3&#8208;PPP and fluvirucinine A1.

A General and Efficient Method for the Direct Synthesis of Primary Arylamines Through Electrochemical Amination of Aryl Halides With NH3 Has Been Developed. The Weak Nucleophilic Reagent NH3 Acted as an Ammonia Surrogate. This Approach Shows Good Functional Group Tolerance and a Broad Scope of Functionalized Primary Arylamines That Can be Further Late&#8208;stage Modification of Drug Molecules and Gram&#8208;scale Reaction Demonstrate Its Synthetic Utility.








Abstract
Primary arylamines are the most pivotal class of organic motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, ligands and natural products. Ammonia (NH3) is an ideal nitrogen source in terms of reactivity, atom economy, and environmental compatibility. Despite significant progress in the synthesis of primary arylamines, the development of a general method for rapid access to diversely functionalized primary arylamines is still urgent and necessary. Herein, we developed a method for the direct synthesis of primary arylamines through electrochemical amination of aryl halides with NH3. Notably, the weak nucleophilic reagent NH3 was directly used as an ammonia surrogate, allowing for efficient conversion of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds to diverse primary arylamines with good functional group tolerance. A broad scope of functionalized primary arylamines has been achieved in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes using aldehydes and silylboranes has been developed, with ligand control influencing the reaction pathway. The employment of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, whereas using (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine leads to 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity.








Abstract
The regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes presents a formidable challenge due to inherently complex selectivity control over multiple potential reaction pathways. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes and silylboranes, achieving unprecedented site&#8208;selectivity using nickel catalysts with distinct phosphine ligands. The use of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, while employing (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine facilitates 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity. This method displays excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and substantial functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ligand choice is crucial for directing the reaction pathway and stabilizing &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;nickel intermediates. Our protocol provides a practical and efficient approach to synthesizing valuable functionalized allylsilanes, which are important in various synthetic applications.

&lt;p&gt;A regiodivergent nickel-catalyzed carbosilylation of 1,3-dienes using aldehydes and silylboranes has been developed, with ligand control influencing the reaction pathway. The employment of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3-addition selectivity, whereas using (2-biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine leads to 4,1-addition selectivity.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the CO2&#8208;Assisted NO Electrochemical Deoxygenation and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

A strategy utilizing CO2 to assist NO electroreduction has been proposed to enhance NH3 synthesis performance. The primary reason for this enhancement is that *CO and *COOH (produced from CO2 reduction) facilitate the deoxygenation of *NO and the hydrogenation of *N, respectively.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic NO reduction to NH3 holds significant potential for pollutant treatment and resource recovery. Herein, we report that the introduction of CO2 on octahedral oxide&#8208;derived copper (o&#8208;OD&#8208;Cu) significantly enhances the electrochemical reduction of NO to NH3. With 10% NO in a CO2 environment, the Faradaic efficiency for NH3 production in a flow cell remains around 80% over a wide current density range from 20 to 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. At a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the yield can reach up to 1403.9&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, which is 3.71 times higher than without CO2 and surpasses the performance reported in similar literature. Moreover, even at a low concentration of 1% NO, the Faradaic efficiency can reach a maximum of 70.11% at a current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. In situ investigations and theoretical calculations revealed that, in the coexistence of NO and CO2, the NO reduction pathway involves a unique route wherein *CO and *COOH, produced from CO2 reduction, can respectively promote the deoxygenation of *NO and hydrogenation of *N by acquiring O atoms from *NO and providing H atoms for the sustained hydrogenation of *N, thereby accelerating the conversion process of NO to NH3.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Assisted Electron and Proton Transfer Boosting Redox Metabolism&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis and Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium and aurintricarboxylic coordination nanoparticles generate singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals specifically triggered by acidic H2O2 via dual&#8208;Russell reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction while depleting glutathione. Significantly, adenosine triphosphate induces VAP NPs aggregation, strengthens hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, and accelerates proton/electron transfer, thereby amplifying ROS level to co&#8208;activate ferroptosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
Compared to the intractability of traditional apoptosis, the vulnerability exposed by cancer cell metabolic reprogramming provides an advantage for ferroptosis treatment. Herein, we developed vanadate and aurintricarboxylic acid coordination nanoparticles (VAP NPs) that synergistically trigger dual cell death pathways. This nanoplatform leveraged dual&#8208;Russell mechanisms and Fenton reactions to generate singlet oxygen/hydroxyl radicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) while depleting glutathione via vanadium redox cycling, thereby silencing glutathione peroxidase 4 and modulating the Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) axis. Notably, TME&#8208;overexpressed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acted as a biochemical catalyst, accelerating the transfer of protons and electrons during reactive oxygen species generation to amplify therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, VAP NPs could achieve outstanding efficacy for intrinsically stimulated synergy of ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor therapy. This study provides reference for revealing the new function of ATP in enhancing the regulation of redox metabolism.

Self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte: A novel electrolyte concept utilizing LiTDI enables a high&#8208;concentration, anion&#8208;rich interfacial region and a low&#8208;concentration bulk electrolyte. This unique design simultaneously enhances interfacial stability and ion transport kinetics in high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrolyte is the key component dictating lithium battery performance, especially under extreme conditions such as fast cycling and low temperatures. However, conventional electrolyte design principles, which generally rely on a homogeneous mixture of solvents, salts, and functional additives, fail to simultaneously meet the requirements for both anodic/cathodic interfacial stability and bulk ion&#8208;transport kinetics in lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present a self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte design methodology. Lithium 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ide (LiTDI), featuring the ability to selectively self&#8208;assemble on the cathode/electrolyte interface, compartmented the electrolyte into a heterogonous one. Close to the cathode side, LiTDI could induce an interfacial high&#8208;concentration region, where the anion&#8208;rich solvation structure facilitates the formation of a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI). In the bulk, the electrolyte maintains a low concentration with low viscosity, ensuring fast ion transport and superior rate performance. Li||NCM811 cells achieve over 500 stable cycles with 80.3% capacity retention and deliver 169.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a 10C discharge rate. Under low&#8208;temperature conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), the cells maintained outstanding stability over 700 cycles at 0.5C charge/discharge, achieving capacity retention of 96.6% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2%. This work provides a new electrolyte design paradigm, addressing the critical challenges of LMBs for high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Switchable Closed&#8208;Shell and Open&#8208;Shell Biradical States in Bis&#8208;Palladium Complexes of Tetrathiadodecaphyrin via Coordination Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes of a figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin, featuring different coordination modes (NNCS&#9472;Pd versus NNCC&#9472;Pd) and electronic states (closed&#8208;shell versus open&#8208;shell biradical), have been prepared. The two complexes exhibit noteworthy photoacoustic (PA) response to the first and second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I/II) range, respectively, and are interconvertible through a one&#8208;electron redox involving a reversible metal coordination rearrangement.








Abstract
A figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin (1), featuring two porphyrin&#8208;like sub&#8208;pockets separated by central carbazolylenes was synthesized. Metalation of the thiaporphyrinoid ligand with Pd(OAc)2 produces two distinct bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes with different coordination environments. Complex 2, adopting an {NNCS} metalation mode, exhibits a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure, whereas complex 3, with an {NNCC} coordination environment, exists as a ligand&#8208;centered organic biradicaloid with two magnetically independent spins (S&#160;=&#160;1/2). Biradical formation is attributed to single&#8208;electron transfer from each ligand sub&#8208;pocket to the Pd(II) center accommodated in a d8 square&#8208;planner coordination geometry. Notably, the complexes are interconvertible through doubly one&#8208;electron redox processes, demonstrating a reversible metal coordination rearrangement via thiophene ring flipping within a porphyrinoid framework. This work establishes the first example of such tunable metal coordination, offering a precise strategy for modulating closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell biradical states. In addition, while complex 2 displays intense absorption and photoacoustic responses to the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) light in water after encapsulation within nanoparticles, the nanocomposites encapsulating biradicaloid 3 exhibits enhanced responsiveness in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region.

&lt;p&gt;Bis-Pd(II) complexes of a figure-eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin, featuring different coordination modes (NNCS&#9472;Pd versus NNCC&#9472;Pd) and electronic states (closed-shell versus open-shell biradical), have been prepared. The two complexes exhibit noteworthy photoacoustic (PA) response to the first and second near-infrared (NIR-I/II) range, respectively, and are interconvertible through a one-electron redox involving a reversible metal coordination rearrangement.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A figure-eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), featuring two porphyrin-like sub-pockets separated by central carbazolylenes was synthesized. Metalation of the thiaporphyrinoid ligand with Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces two distinct bis-Pd(II) complexes with different coordination environments. Complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, adopting an {NNCS} metalation mode, exhibits a closed-shell electronic structure, whereas complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, with an {NNCC} coordination environment, exists as a ligand-centered organic biradicaloid with two magnetically independent spins (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1/2). Biradical formation is attributed to single-electron transfer from each ligand sub-pocket to the Pd(II) center accommodated in a d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; square-planner coordination geometry. Notably, the complexes are interconvertible through doubly one-electron redox processes, demonstrating a reversible metal coordination rearrangement via thiophene ring flipping within a porphyrinoid framework. This work establishes the first example of such tunable metal coordination, offering a precise strategy for modulating closed-shell and open-shell biradical states. In addition, while complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; displays intense absorption and photoacoustic responses to the first near-infrared (NIR-I) light in water after encapsulation within nanoparticles, the nanocomposites encapsulating biradicaloid &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibits enhanced responsiveness in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Basis of Sequential Enantioselective Epoxidation by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase in Lasalocid A Biosynthesis</title>

Lsd18 is a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase from Streptomyces lasalocidi that performs two enantioselective epoxidations during lasalocid A biosynthesis. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Lsd18 bound to a substrate and product analogue illuminate how this enzyme performs multiple epoxidations on the same substrate molecule and how it controls stereoselectivity.








Abstract
Polyether polyketides are a structurally diverse group of natural products known for their antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. Lasalocid A is a canonical natural polyether produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces lasalocidi. In lasalocid A biosynthesis, a polyene polyketide intermediate is converted into a bisepoxide by the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase enzyme Lsd18. Remarkably, Lsd18 acts on two distinct C&#9552;C groups in the substrate molecule, forming two (R,R) epoxides. We have determined the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Lsd18 in the substrate&#8208;free, substrate&#8208;bound, and product&#8208;bound forms. Our work has revealed that Lsd18 has an extra&#8208;large substrate&#8208;binding pocket that allows the polyene to adopt different conformations within the enzyme pocket. This feature enables Lsd18 to epoxidate both of the C&#9552;C groups. Additionally, a subpocket located near the Lsd18 active site controls stereoselectivity by dictating which face of the C&#9552;C group is placed next to the flavin. Molecular understanding of how Lsd18 transforms a polyene into a bisepoxide during lasalocid A biosynthesis lays the foundation for the production of designer polyethers for drug development.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Carbonylation of Azetidines via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluorocarbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a site&#8208;selective Cu&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of azetidines promoted by difluorocarbene insertion at low temperature, enabling access to a variety of functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes (40 examples). This skeletal expansion strategy provides a distinct disconnection approach to synthesize medicinally relevant five&#8208;membered heterocycles.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Lactams are privileged five&#8208;membered pharmaco&#8208;phores in numerous bioactive compounds, but access to these motifs typically relies on cycloaddition/substitution chemistry involving activated substrates or CO carbonylations under harsh conditions. Here, we report a new route to functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams through formal carbonylation of azetidines under nonprecious metal catalysis. The method leverages a copper&#8208;stabilized difluorocarbene to promote site&#8208;selective insertion followed by in situ hydrolysis to unmask the lactam group. In contrast to most difluorocarbene reactions that cause ring cleavage of saturated heterocycles in the presence of heat, the present system operates at a low temperature and retains the integrity of the cyclic structure. Synthesis of various drug&#8208;like lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes highlights utility.

         <title>Ionized Water Facilitates the Sustainable Radical&#8208;Mediated Reduction of CO2 to Multi&#8208;Carbon Hydrocarbons and Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water generates radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) that reduce CO2 to C1&#9472;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates. e&#8315;aq activates CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables hydrogenation. Oxidative radicals recycle oxygenates back into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a sustainable network. This process demonstrates ionized water as a reactive matrix for abiotic organic synthesis. 








Abstract
The abiotic synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 and water under prebiotic conditions is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in understanding the origins of life. Here we demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway for reducing CO2 to C1&#8210;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates driven solely by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water, mimicking early Earth environments. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 17O/13C isotope labeling, and femtosecond transient absorption, we identify ionized water&#8208;derived radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) as the key redox mediators. e&#8315;aq acts as a super&#8208;reductant (&#8722;2.9&#160;V) to activate CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables sequential hydrogenation. Critically, oxidative radicals (H2O&#8226;+ and &#8226;OH) recycle recalcitrant oxygenates (formate and oxalate) back into active CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a dynamic radical network. This process generates a diverse library of organic compounds, including methane, ethylene, and C6 dimethyl succinate, via radical assembly mechanisms spanning hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT), self&#8208;coupling, and cross&#8208;coupling. By integrating experimental validation with prebiotic simulations (formate&#8208;mediated redox modulation), we resolve the paradox of inert CO2/H2 activation in primordial environments and establish water not merely as a solvent but as a reactive matrix directing abiotic organic synthesis.

         <title>An Immediate Bacterial&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Thio&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide: A Real&#8208;Time NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial</title>

         <dc:description>
A supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide can be immediately reduced to a supramolecular radical anion by bacteria, leading to a NIR&#8208;II absorption. This strategy effectively raises the reduction potential, thereby greatly boosting the reduction speed. This approach has been used as a real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacterial and opens new horizons for bio&#8208;responsive agents.








Abstract
A new kind of supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide (SNDI) which can be immediately reduced as supramolecular radical anion by bacteria is reported. The introduction of thiocarbonyl effectively elevates the reduction potential of SNDI, largely increasing the bacteria&#8208;response speed in hypoxia. It selectively distinguishes the bacteria with high and low reduction ability in real time. The host&#8211;guest complexation of SNDI and cucurbit[7]uril can enhance radical anion quantum yield, ensuring intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and realizing high photothermal conversion. The real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacteria is successfully carried out. This development will enrich the design of bio&#8208;responsive agent with promising future towards actual application.

This approach has been used as a real-time NIR-II photothermal anti-bacterial and opens new horizons for bio-responsive agents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new kind of supramolecular thio-naphthalene diimide (SNDI) which can be immediately reduced as supramolecular radical anion by bacteria is reported. The introduction of thiocarbonyl effectively elevates the reduction potential of SNDI, largely increasing the bacteria-response speed in hypoxia. It selectively distinguishes the bacteria with high and low reduction ability in real time. The host&#8211;guest complexation of SNDI and cucurbit[7]uril can enhance radical anion quantum yield, ensuring intense NIR-II absorption and realizing high photothermal conversion. The real-time NIR-II photothermal anti-bacteria is successfully carried out. This development will enrich the design of bio-responsive agent with promising future towards actual application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Surface&#8208;Enhanced Ni&#8211;Mn Diatomic Site Catalysts for Efficient Seawater Electrolysis via the Degradation of High Ionization Potential Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively constructs a dual transition metal atoms catalytic system through the strategic anchoring of Ni and Mn atoms on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (O&#8208;BN), achieving breakthrough performance in simultaneous high ionization potential pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution for marine energy applications under light condition.








Abstract
In response to energy shortages and hard&#8208;to&#8208;degrade chemical pollution, especially high ionization potential (IP) organic pollutants, this study developed a novel photoelectrocatalyst, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN, for degrading IP pollutants in seawater and generating hydrogen. Incorporating Ni&#8211;Mn dual atoms into an O&#8208;doped boron nitride (OBN) framework, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN, shows excellent stability and HER performance. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis revealed its low Gibbs free energy change (&#916;GH* = 0.03&#160;eV) for HER, outperforming Pt (111). Achieving an ultralow overpotential of 43.8&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 under AM 1.5G, simulated light surpasses commercial Pt/C catalysts. High IP pollutants enhance hydrogen evolution rates, indicating a synergistic effect. Theoretical calculations elucidated the interplay between seawater electrolytes and high IP values on the photoelectrocatalytic performance. Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN demonstrated excellent stability and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 3.72%, offering a sustainable solution for marine pollution control and clean energy production.

         <title>Octalenobisterphenylene and Its Diradical Dianionic Cyclodimer: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terphenylene dimer B, a fragment of the metallic (4,6,8)biphenylene network, with pronounced reactivity and strain was prepared from biaryl A by successive closures of four four&#8208;membered and two eight&#8208;membered rings. The treatment of B with sodium metal induced cyclodimerization, yielding a diradical dianion [(Na+)2(B&#8226;&#8211;)2] through a presumed radical&#8208;anion&#8208;mediated mechanism. The two spins in [(Na+)2(B&#8226;&#8211;)2] exhibit negligible mutual interaction.








Abstract
Octalenobisterphenylene 1 (also known as terphenylene dimer) was synthesized from 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;substituted biaryl by tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization followed by oxidative coupling. This one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol facilitated the successive formation of four four&#8208;membered and two eight&#8208;membered rings. Treatment of 1 with sodium metal, followed by crystallization from THF, yielded the remarkable diradical dianion [(1&#8226;&#8211;)2]2&#8722;, where the two molecular halves are connected by four &#963; bonds. The cyclodimerization is driven by the pronounced reactivity and strain of the central six&#8208;membered ring within the [3]phenylene subunit. The structure and diradical nature of [(Na+)2(1&#8226;&#8211;)2] were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT computations, and 1H NMR and ESR spectra. These investigations revealed that the two spins, one on each molecular half, exhibit minimal mutual interaction.

A data&#8211;knowledge&#8208;dual&#8208;driven framework is proposed for mining high&#8208;temperature fast&#8208;charging electrolytes, integrating high&#8208;throughput calculation, machine learning, and experimental verification. The screened ethyl trimethylacetate&#8208;based electrolyte strengthens Li&#8208;ion batteries performance at 4.0 C and 45 &#176;C by thermostable solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. 








Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) starve for minutes&#8208;level fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), while the heat gathering at high&#8208;rate charging and torridity conditions has detrimental effects on electrolytes, triggering rapid battery degradation and even safety hazards. However, the current research on high&#8208;temperature fast&#8208;charging (HTFC) electrolytes is very lacking. We revolutionized the conventional paradigm of developing HTFC electrolytes integrating with high&#8208;throughput calculation, machine&#8208;learning techniques, and experimental verifications to establish a data&#8211;knowledge&#8208;dual&#8208;driven approach. Ethyl trimethylacetate was efficiently screened out based on the approach and enabled batteries to work under high temperatures with distinctly restricted side reactions. A stable and highly safe fast&#8208;charging (15&#8208;min charging to 80% capacity) cycling without Li plating was achieved over 4100 cycles at 45 &#176;C based on 181&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells, demonstrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in this field.

         <title>An Enzymatic Platform for Aniline Synthesis Through Oxidative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic platform for aniline synthesis, based on the oxidative amination of readily available cyclohexanones, has been reported. Engineered variants exhibit broad substrate compatibility, enabling the synthesis of 40 structurally diverse secondary and tertiary anilines with conversions of up to 91%. Mechanistic studies revealed that directed evolution enhanced enzyme performance in imine desaturation while suppressing phenol formation.








Abstract
Aniline motifs are commonly found in natural products and synthetic molecules. While chemists have developed numerous methods for constructing C(sp2)&#9472;N bonds, their biocatalytic counterparts in nature are primarily limited to P450&#8208;based protein machineries. To address this limitation, we developed a biocatalytic platform for aniline synthesis based on oxidative amination of cyclohexanones. Through directed evolution of a flavin&#8208;dependent enzyme PtOYE, we identified several protein catalysts (e.g., OYE_G3 and OYE_M3) that exhibited activity across a broad array of substrates, enabling the preparation of 40 different secondary and tertiary anilines with various substitution patterns in up to 91% GC conversion. Mechanistic investigations revealed the improved kinetic performance of the evolved variants on the desaturation of imines. Additionally, mutations introduced through protein engineering further reduced the propensity for phenol formation. This enzymatic platform represents a highly promising application of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, showcasing their great potential in organic synthesis and drug development.

         <title>Cathodic Hydroxide Ions Induce Tetrose Formation during Glycolaldehyde Electroreduction to Alcohols: A Potential CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Carbohydrate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glycolaldehyde electrolysis mechanism to alcohols and tetroses is comprehensively studied. Novel insights on the role of glycolaldehyde in the late stages of the overall CO2 reduction reaction pathways to ethanol and ethylene glycol on copper are presented. We demonstrate for the first time that C4 sugars (47.2% maximum conversion) can be produced in the electrochemical cell under ambient conditions due to the hydroxide ions produced on the cathode.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 can potentially alleviate climate change by hampering the atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. The production of carbohydrates from CO2 reduction will have promising applications for the manufacturing of valuable, multi&#8208;carbon compounds that are traditionally produced from the petrochemical or agricultural industries. In this work, we analyzed the copper&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical reduction of glycolaldehyde, a commonly observed trace CO2RR product that has been previously proposed as an intermediate for alcohol formation. We determine that glycolaldehyde is not the main intermediate on polycrystalline copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts that selectively produce ethanol. In an unbuffered electrolyte, the cathodic hydroxide ions produced induce the coupling of glycolaldehyde to tetroses in the solution phase, yielding a maximum glycolaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;sugar conversion of 47.2% under ambient conditions. Using in situ infrared spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that glycolaldehyde reduction to alcohols proceeds via adsorption of its enol tautomer, &#951;2(C,C)&#9472;CHOH&#9552;CHOH. Our findings not only shed light on the C2 alcohol formation pathways during CO2RR, but also imply that a CO2 electrolyzer can potentially produce C4 carbohydrates via CO2 reduction to glycolaldehyde followed by C&#9472;C coupling in the solution phase, with only a high local pH needed to drive the tetrose formation step.

         <title>DNA Nanotubule&#8208;Based Nanodevices with ATP&#8208;Responsive Gating for Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Nucleic Acids and Proteins</title>

Schematic illustration of two pathways for macromolecular therapeutics delivery: nanoparticle&#8208;adopted endocytosis (left) and DNA nanotubule&#8208;mediated cytosolic delivery (right). By bypassing conventional endocytic routes, the nanotubules directly transport substantial payloads, including nucleic acids and proteins, across the plasma membrane. 








Abstract
Delivering biomacromolecules to the cytosol remains a formidable challenge, as these molecules are predominantly sequestered within endosomes after endocytosis. The limited efficacy of current delivery systems in promoting reliable endosomal escape underscores the need for innovative strategies. Here, we report a DNA origami nanotubule to construct transmembrane delivery nanodevices with size&#8208;selective gating and ATP&#8208;responsive channel activation. By integrating unilamellar vesicles as large storage compartments, these nanodevices can encapsulate a wide range of macromolecules, including small interfering RNA, messenger RNA, plasmid DNA, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. By bypassing traditional endocytic pathways, the nanotubules enable the delivery of substantial payload quantities directly across the plasma membrane. This approach provides a promising platform for delivering macromolecular therapeutics into the cytosol, advancing gene therapy strategies, and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Photovoltaic Absorber &#8220;Glues&#8221; for Efficient Bifacial Selenium Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

A glue&#8208;bonding strategy using high&#8208;viscosity molten selenium (Se) as an adhesive is reported to bond two fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses, creating bifacial solar cells without magnetron sputtering. The Se cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, with efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8.








Abstract
Bifacial solar cells hold great potential for achieving higher power output than conventional monofacial devices by harvesting solar irradiance from both their front and rear surfaces. However, almost all currently reported bifacial devices typically require a sputtered rear transparent conducting oxide electrode, which can damage the underlying layers due to plasma effects during the deposition process. Here, we report a glue&#8208;bonding strategy that uses a high&#8208;viscosity photovoltaic absorber slurry&#8212;in the case of molten selenium (Se)&#8212;as the adhesive to bond two charge&#8208;transport layer&#8208;deposited commercial fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide glasses, directly creating bifacial solar cells without the use of magnetron sputtering. We find that molten Se exhibits relatively high viscosity, high stability, and Newtonian fluid characteristics, facilitating film formation using this strategy. The resulting bifacial Se solar cells exhibit a bifaciality factor of 90.1%, surpassing all types of conventional thin&#8208;film solar cells. These cells achieve efficiencies of 8.61% under 1&#8208;sun illumination with an albedo of 0.3 and 26.17% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination with an albedo of 0.8, with no efficiency loss after 1000&#160;h of ambient storage.

Synopsis: Heating the trinuclear Ti dinitrogen complex [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#181;3&#8208;&#951;1:&#8201;&#951;2:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] 1(Cp*&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) leads to the cleavage of N&#8801;N bond, forming a tetranuclear titanium nitride cluster [{TiCp*}4Cl(&#181;&#8208;Cl)3(&#181;3&#8208;N)2] 2. Complex 2 reacts with pinacolborane, leading to the formation of N&#8208;B bond derivatives [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;NBpin)Cl}2]. When treated with pyridine or DMAP, complex 2 was dissociated to form a bent trinuclear Ti nitrido complex. 








Abstract
Heating the readily available trinuclear Ti dinitrogen complex [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#181;3&#8208;&#951;1:&#8201;&#951;2:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] 1(Cp*&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), originally reported by C. Y&#233;lamos and J. Jover, in benzene at 80&#160;&#176;C leads to the cleavage of N&#8801;N bond, forming a tetranuclear titanium nitride cluster [{TiCp*}4Cl(&#181;&#8208;Cl)3(&#181;3&#8208;N)2] 2. The structure of 2 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the energy barrier for the NN bond cleavage in the transformation from 1 to 2 is about 26&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. Complex 2 exhibits reactivity toward various electrophiles, producing a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in the presence of air, while concurrently regenerating Ti(IV) salts. Furthermore, complex 2 reacts with pinacolborane, leading to the formation of N&#8208;B bond derivatives [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;NBPin)Cl}2] 3. When complex 2&#8211;15N is treated with pyridine or 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), it dissociates to form a bent trinuclear Ti nitrido complex [{TiCp*}3Cl3(L)2(&#181;&#8208;15N)2] 4&#8208;L (L&#160;=&#160;py or DMAP).

         <title>Electrostatic Potential Matching in an Anion&#8208;Pillared Framework for Benchmark Hexafluoroethane Purification from Ternary Mixture</title>

The electrostatic potential matching in the anion&#8208;pillared SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu realizes effective anchoring of CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions, exhibiting the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity as well as unprecedented CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 selectivity, thereby achieving benchmark separation of ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture. 








Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of CF3CF3 from ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 mixture is crucial since its vital role in the semiconductor industry. However, efficient separation of chemically inert CF&#8323;CF&#8323; remains challenging due to the difficulty in creating specific recognition sites in porous materials. In this work, we report the first example of anion&#8208;pillared MOFs to the separation of fluorinated electronic specialty gases, utilizing the unique electrostatic potential matching in the bipolar pores of SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to realize a benchmark CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 separation. SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu exhibits the highest CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 adsorption capacity at 0.01&#160;bar, as well as the highest CF3CH2F/CF3CF3 and CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 IAST selectivity. Additionally, high&#8208;purity (&#8805; 99.995%) CF3CF3 with record productivity (882.9&#160;L kg&#8722;1) can be acquired through one&#8208;step breakthrough experiment of CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/CF3CF3 (5/5/90). Theoretical calculations further reveal that the coexistence of electronegative SiF62&#8722; and partially electropositive H sites promotes SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to effectively anchor CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2 through multiple supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Dimensionality Reduction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Monolayers for Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>

Dimensionality reduction of 3D MOFs into 1.8&#8208;nm&#8208;thick monoMOF maximizes catalytic site exposure and enhances CO2 electroreduction. The cobalt(II)&#8211;porphyrin&#8208;embedded monoMOF&#8208;Co achieves 93% CO Faradaic efficiency (versus 51% for 3D_MOF&#8208;Co) at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE, with a 10,600&#160;h&#8722;1 turnover frequency and 47&#8208;hour stability in near&#8208;neutral electrolyte, demonstrating superior electron/mass transfer through dimensional engineering.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential candidates for electrocatalysis due to their well&#8208;defined, tunable structures, and ability to incorporate diverse active sites. However, their inherent insulating nature restricts electron transfer from electrode to remote active sites, leading to diminished catalytic performance. In this work, we present a novel strategy to overcome this limitation by reducing 3D MOFs (3D_MOFs) into monolayered MOFs (monoMOFs) with a thickness of &#8764;1.8&#160;nm, maximizing the exposure of catalytic sites to the electrode and enhancing electrocatalytic performance. We designed and synthesized a monoMOF incorporating cobalt(II)&#8211;porphyrin sites in the linker (monoMOF&#8208;Co) for CO2 electroreduction. After being grafted onto graphene oxide, the monoMOF&#8208;Co exhibited a peak faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO&#160;=&#160;93%), surpassing the performance of a 3D_MOF incorporating the same porphyrin&#8211;Co&#8208;based linker (3D_MOF&#8208;Co, FECO&#160;=&#160;51%). Additionally, monoMOF&#8208;Co achieved a turnover frequency of 10&#160;600 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintained stability over 47 h in a near&#8208;neutral aqueous solution. In situ spectroscopic studies further confirmed the distinct electric field environment in the Stern layer between monoMOF&#8208;Co and 3D_MOF&#8208;Co. Furthermore, similar enhancement effects of monoMOFs over 3D_MOFs were observed in the nitrate and oxygen electroreduction reactions, highlighting the broader applicability of monoMOFs in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Engineering Bodipy&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Spectrum Photocatalysis in Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three highly&#160;stable bodipy&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (BMOFs) were synthesized by treating dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Featuring the distinct bodipy scaffold in the framework, these BMOFs displayed high reactivity in heterogenous photocatalytic C&#9472;H bond&#160;activation of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to access amides under visible light.








Abstract
Developing photocatalysts that can efficiently utilize the full solar spectrum is a crucial step toward transforming sustainable energy solutions. Due to their light absorption limitations, most photo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constrained to the ultraviolet (UV) and blue light regions. Expanding their absorption to encompass the entire solar spectrum would unlock their full potential, greatly enhancing efficiency and applicability. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a series of highly stable boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (bodipy)&#8208;based MOFs (BMOFs) by reacting dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Leveraging the acidity of the methyl groups on the bodipy backbone, we expanded the conjugation system through a solid&#8208;state condensation reaction with various aldehydes, achieving full&#8208;color absorption, thereby extending the band edge into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) regions. These BMOFs demonstrated exceptional reactivity and recyclability in heterogeneous photocatalytic activities, including C&#9472;H bond activation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles and C&#9472;N bond cleavage of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to produce amides under visible light. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of BMOFs in photocatalysis, marking a significant leap forward in the design of advanced photocatalytic materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Building a Confluence Charge Transfer Pathway in COFs for Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Water and Air</title>

This work not only provides new insights into the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by modulating charge transfer pathways to boost H2O2 photosynthesis but also paves the way for practical application of COF photocatalysts to generate H2O2 for water decontamination.








Abstract
Sunlight&#8208;driven photosynthesis by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from water and air without using sacrificial reagents is a promising H2O2 fabrication approach but is still restricted by the insufficient charge separation and sluggish 2e&#8722; water oxidation process. Herein, we provide a facile strategy to simultaneously improve charge separation and water oxidation in COFs via confining the charge transfer pathways from two diversion ones to a confluence one through regulating the site of nitrogen in bipyridine. Combining in&#8208;situ characterization with computational calculations, we reveal that compared to COF&#8208;BD1 containing two diversion charge transfer pathways, the charge transfer pathway in COF&#8208;BD2 is confined to a confluence due to the electron&#8208;deficiency effect of nitrogen, which greatly accelerates the intermolecular and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transfer. Via effectively reducing the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining water oxidation reaction (WOR), the subsequent water oxidation process to produce the key *OH intermediate in COF&#8208;BD2 is also greatly facilitated, boosting the yield of H2O2 (5211&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) from water, oxygen, and light without sacrificial agents or additional energy consumption. We further demonstrate that H2O2 can be efficiently produced by COF&#8208;BD2 in a broad pH range, in real water, and in an enlarged reactor using natural sunlight for water decontamination.

         <title>Boron Doping&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Ce3+ Ratio in Amorphous CeO2/GO Catalyst for Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel strategy to synthesize amorphous CeO2/GO with an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio of 85.7% through B&#8208;doping. The resulting amorphous structure reduces the band gap, enhances charge separation efficiency, and significantly boosts diluted CO2 photocatalytic activity. The material achieves remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rates of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2) with 100% selectivity, highlighting its potential for sustainable CO2 conversion. 








Abstract
Direct utilization of diluted CO2 enables sustainable CO2 conversion into valuable products, with reduced CeO2 emerging as an attractive candidate due to its exceptional redox flexibility. The catalytic efficacy of CeO2 is intimately tied to the electronic structure of 4f, yet the persistent challenge lies in maintaining a high and stable concentration of Ce3+. In this study, we propose a symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;induced amorphization strategy to achieve an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio by B doping, which facilitates the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in amorphous CeO2. First&#8208;principles calculations and infrared spectroscopy reveal that B doping with three excess electrons induces the formation of planar triangular B&#8211;O&#8323; units by disrupting the original high&#8208;symmetry Fm3&#175;m$Fm\bar 3m$ structure of CeO2, facilitating the spontaneous transition to the amorphous phase. Electronic structure analysis confirms that even a modest 7.5% B doping can significantly elevate the Ce3+ ratio to 85.7%. The resulting amorphous B&#8208;doped CeO2/GO shows a remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2), with 100% selectivity in both cases. This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO2/GO with high Ce3+ an effective material for CO2 photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO2 capture and utilization.

         <title>Unveiling the Catalytic Potential of Facet Heterojunctions in Platinum Alloys for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition of octahedral PtNi nanoparticles (NPs) to a truncated structure enriches the diversity of catalytic sites. The edge sites, featuring facet heterojunctions, leverage geometric and ligand synergies to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and optimize the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates, leading to superior performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).








Abstract
Ensuring high&#8208;quality activity of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) while mitigating the degradation of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts remains challenging. A platinum&#8208;skinned truncated octahedral PtNi alloy with (100)/(111) facet heterostructures is synthesized through a low&#8208;temperature thermally driven etching strategy, demonstrating exceptional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. The heterostructure of the Ptskin&#8208;PtNi(111) facet destabilizes the *OOH intermediate and promotes the preferential O&#9472;O bond cleavage, leading to the optimization of ORR pathway. A linear correlation between the generalized coordination number (CN&#175;$\overline {{\mathrm{CN}}} $) and &#916;G*OH demonstrates that the facet hetero&#8208;sites optimize the adsorption of *OH to the theoretically optimal state through ligand and geometric effects. The optimized PNZC&#8208;5A160 catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity (2.97 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V vs. RHE) and superior H2&#8208;O2 single PEMFC performance [mass activity (MA) of 0.5 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free; peak power density of 1.42&#160;W cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. After accelerated stress tests, the loss in MA at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free and in potential at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2 is only 8% and 3.7&#160;mV, respectively, due to the enhanced binding of subsurface Pt and Ni to surface Pt atoms through Pt skin, thereby inhibiting the dissolution of Pt and Ni.

         <title>Antibacterial Siderophores of Pandoraea Pathogens and Their Impact on the Diseased Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of environmental and pathogenic Pandoraea species identified a conserved NRPS gene cluster and led to the discovery of novel siderophores, pandorabactins, which exert their antibacterial activity by depleting iron from competitors. Bioinformatic analysis of sputum from cystic fibrosis patients coupled with bioassays indicates that pandorabactins outcompete other bacteria in sequestering iron and have an impact on the diseased lung microbiota.








Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics&#8208;guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of Pandoraea and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron.

&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic-resistant bacteria of the genus &lt;i&gt;Pandoraea&lt;/i&gt;, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse &lt;i&gt;Pandoraea&lt;/i&gt; species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (&lt;i&gt;pan&lt;/i&gt;) that codes for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics-guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the &lt;i&gt;pan&lt;/i&gt; gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (&lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Stenotrophomonas&lt;/i&gt;) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of &lt;i&gt;Pandoraea&lt;/i&gt; and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultra&#8208;Incompressible Beryllium Tungsten Nitride Pernitride BeW10N14(N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ternary transition metal pernitride was synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach starting from W2Be4N5. The structure features not only the rare structural motif of BeN6 octahedra but also dinitrogen anions. DFT calculations reveal ultra&#8208;incompressible and metallic behavior of the new compound.








Abstract
For the activation of nitrogen and its reduction to ammonia, transition metals are crucial in biological as well as industrial processes. So far, only a few binary transition metal compounds with nitrogen dimer anions are known, whereas a ternary compound has remained undiscovered as yet. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first ternary transition metal compound, namely, BeW10N14(N2), which exhibits dinitrogen anions. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from W2Be4N5. The crystal structure, elucidated with synchrotron radiation, unites WN7 capped trigonal prisms with intriguing BeN6 octahedra and (N2)&#8208;anions. Elastic and electronic properties of the title compound were corroborated by DFT calculations, revealing simultaneous ultra&#8208;incompressible and metallic behavior. The synthesis and investigation of the first ternary transition metal nitride with dinitrogen units opens the door to a new field of research on nitride and pernitride chemistry.

         <title>Crystalline Silagermenides as Powerful Synthons: Unraveling &#960;&#8208;Bonding and Lone Pair Effects in the Multiple Bonds of Heavier Main Group Analogs of the Vinyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic silagermenides are synthesized through a straightforward desilylation process. Their electronic properties are explored using DFT calculations, revealing a high&#8208;lying and polarized Si&#9472;Ge &#960; bond. Reactions with electrophiles lead to nucleophilic substitution at the Si atom, giving germylene intermediates, which then undergo further transformation into unique main group compounds and unprecedented metal complexes.








Abstract
Compared to common vinyl anions, their heavier heteronuclear analog, silagermenides [R2Si&#9552;GeR]&#713;, remain exceedingly rare. Herein, we present a systematic investigation of silagermenides, synthesized via a straightforward desilylation route. We delve into the bonding characteristics, revealing a weak, polarized Si&#9472;Ge &#960; bond with a significant nonbonded lone pair character at the &#946;&#8208;Si position. This &#946;&#8208;Si exhibits predominantly nucleophilic behavior, while the &#945;&#8208;Ge position demonstrates subtly electrophilic tendencies, despite the presence of a vinylic, formally anionic Ge atom. This leads to the formation of silagermenide complexes in an unprecedented &#951;2 coordination mode, as well as various silagermenes and germylenes with unconventional substituents. We also document the facile cleavage of the ambiphilic Si&#9552;Ge double bond, resulting in the transfer of a formal doubly reduced silylene and a formal germyliumylidene. Our findings expand the understanding of heavier main group analogs of the vinyl anion, with important implications for their synthesis and reactivity.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Circumtetracene: Unraveling Structure&#8208;Property Relationships of Circumacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable circumtetracene derivative has been successfully synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. A comparison of its electronic properties (both experimentally and by theoretical calculations) with those of previously reported circumacene analogues, led to elucidation of a significant transition in the electronic structure from a closed&#8208;shell global aromatic to a singlet open&#8208;shell local aromatic configuration upon &#960;&#8208;extension.








Abstract
Circumacenes have garnered significant interest in both fundamental science and nanoelectronics due to their unique electronic structures. However, their synthesis and investigations into the structure&#8211;property relationships present considerable challenges. In this work, we report the successful synthesis and characterization of a stable circumtetracene derivative in crystalline form. For comparison, a new circumanthracene derivative was also prepared. The electronic properties of both compounds were systematically investigated using both various experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It was found that circumtetracene exhibits a dominant local aromatic nature with small open&#8208;shell diradical character, while circumanthracene displays a closed&#8208;shell global aromatic character. Both compounds show amphoteric redox behavior with narrow energy gaps. The dication of circumtetracene and the dianions of circumtetracene and circumanthracene can be obtained experimentally through chemical oxidation and reduction, all displaying intense NIR absorptions. Furthermore, the electronic properties of these derivatives were compared with those of previously reported circumacene analogues, revealing a transition in electronic structure from closed&#8208;shell global aromatic to singlet open&#8208;shell local aromatic configurations upon &#960;&#8208;extension. This work provides a comprehensive exploration of the structure&#8208;property relationships within the circumacene series, offering valuable insights for the design and synthesis of novel multizigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>A Bench&#8208;Stable Fluorophosphine Nickel(0) Complex and Its Catalytic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein present the synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable Ni(0) complex, [Ni(PFPh2)4], stabilized by vastly underexplored fluorophosphine ligands. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and Kumada&#8208;Tamao&#8208;Corriu cross&#8208;coupling reactions as well as in Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#9472;N bond formation reactions, indicates its promising potential as alternative to conventional Ni(0) sources.








Abstract
We herein present a fluorophosphine&#8208;based nickel(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] (1), which is highly stable in air and water. [Ni(PFPh2)4] can be obtained from a one&#8208;pot reaction of [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 with Ph2P(&#9552;O)&#8211;PPh2, involving a unique in situ reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) and a simultaneous fluorination by the BF4&#8722; anion. This complex does not only incorporate a nickel center in the zero&#8208;oxidation state, resulting from a Ni(II) precursor, but also includes fluorophosphine ligands, which typically disproportionate immediately in solution. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] as highly stable Ni(0) pre&#8208;catalyst in combination with additional phosphine ligands, such as dppf (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene), in various coupling reactions uncovers its high catalytic activity and versatility, which is superior to [Ni(COD)2] (COD&#9552;cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene) as conventional Ni(0) source.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Sodium Cyclohexanolate/Phenoxide Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair demonstrated 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. The synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light enhances the overall performance, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light provides heat, while high&#8208;frequency light facilitates the desorption of product from the catalyst surface.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage is a key challenge for the implementation of hydrogen energy, with dehydrogenation being particularly difficult because of its endothermic nature, slow kinetics, poor selectivity, etc. Solar energy&#8208;driven hydrogen uptake/release represents an interdisciplinary approach that provides an effective solution to those problems. Herein, we report the solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen uptake of 4.9&#160;wt.% over sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair, achieving over 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. Notably, the initial dehydrogenation rate reaches 23.4 mmolH2gcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{{\mathrm{l}}}_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_2}}}{{{\mathrm{g}}}_{{\mathrm{cat}}}}^{ - 1}{{{\mathrm{h}}}^{ - 1}}$ that is ca. 2 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The superior photocatalytic performance stems from the synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light mainly provides heat, high&#8208;frequency light drives the desorption of product from the catalyst surface. This approach offers a path toward a sustainable solar&#8208;driven hydrogen energy system.

         <title>Modification of [2.2]Paracyclophanes via Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Electrooxidative or Photoredox C&#9472;H Acyloxylation and Alkoxylation</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol with an excellent s&#8208;factor for the preparation of chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes through cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#9472;H oxygenation was developed. This approach leverages traceless electrons or oxygen to replace traditional stoichiometric metal oxidants, facilitating the reaction under mild conditions with broad scope.








Abstract
Chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) have widespread application in asymmetric catalysis and materials science. However, enantioselective C&#9472;H activation of PCPs remains elusive and challenging due to steric hindrance, which differs significantly from conventional aryl C&#9472;H bonds. Herein, we present a cobalt/Salox&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#9472;H acyloxylation and alkoxylation of racemic PCPs with carboxylic acids and alcohols under electrooxidative or photoredox conditions. This innovative approach leverages traceless electrons or oxygen to replace traditional stoichiometric metal oxidants, allowing the reaction to proceed under mild conditions. The method enables the efficient synthesis of oxygenated optically enriched PCPs, achieving yields of up to 50% with 99% ee, as well as up to 49% yields and 99% ee for the recovered starting materials, resulting in exceptional s&#8208;factors of up to 1057. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, accommodating a diverse array of carboxylic acids, including complicated natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. This strategy not only provides an efficient route for synthesizing optically enriched PCP compounds but also highlights the potential of electrooxidative and photoredox methodologies in asymmetric C&#9472;H activation reactions.

         <title>Unprecedented &#8220;off&#8208;pathway&#8221; [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Retroelectrocyclization Reaction Between an Unsymmetric Alkyne and Tetracyanoquinodimethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widely used [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction between tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and an activated alkyne has been shown to occur&#160;with &#8220;inverted&#8221; regiochemistry to give exclusive formation of an unexpected regioisomer. A combined experimental and theoretical study helped unravel the peculiar reaction mechanism underlying the regioselectivity switching.








Abstract
In recent years, the [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction between electron&#8208;rich alkynes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has emerged as one of the most effective synthetic routes to prepare a large variety of molecular and polymeric electron donor&#8211;acceptor systems. Besides its simplicity, fast rate, and high yield, this reaction may also display complete and predictable regioselectivity, as in the case when tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is used in combination with unsymmetric, activated alkynes. Here, we report the first example of a [2+2] CA&#8208;RE reaction between TCNQ and an aniline&#8208;activated alkyne following an &#8220;inverted&#8221; regiochemistry, thus leading to the exclusive formation of an unexpected regioisomer in contrast to the expected one. A combined experimental and theoretical study helped us to unravel the peculiar reaction mechanism underlying the regioselectivity switching.

         <title>Remote Spin&#8208;Center Shift Enables Activation of Distal Benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remote spin&#8208;center shift process that involves 1,n&#8208;radical translocation followed by elimination of a leaving group has been developed to enable distal benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N bond activation. By this process, a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical promoted radical deoxygenative and deaminative functionalization of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines to afford a wide range of alkylated products.








Abstract
A spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) is a radical process that commonly involves a 1,2&#8208;radical shift along with the elimination of an adjacent leaving group by a two&#8208;electron ionic movement. The conventional SCS process is largely limited to 1,2&#8208;radical translocation, while a remote SCS event involving 1,n&#8208;radical translocation over a greater distance to enable distal bond functionalization remains largely underexplored. Herein, we report the boryl radical&#8208;promoted distal deoxygenation and deamination of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines, respectively, through a remote SCS event. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom of a benzoate or benzamide. Then, radical translocation took place across the aromatic ring to promote benzylic C&#9472;O or C&#9472;N bond cleavage. The resulting radical intermediate subsequently coupled with various alkenes to afford a wide range of alkylated products. The proposed mechanistic pathway was supported by experimental investigations.

         <title>Acyclic Quaternary Stereocenters via Catalytic Asymmetric Cross&#8208;Couplings with Unactivated Alkyl N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of compounds featuring an acyclic quaternary stereocenter was achieved through an iron&#8208;catalyzed alkylation reaction using unactivated alkyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters. The efficiency of this sterically demanding construction is dictated by an outer&#8208;sphere C&#9472;C bond formation mechanism, with enantioselectivity regulated by a cooperative triple catalysis system that integrates photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and iron catalysis.








Abstract
While significant advancements have been made in creating quaternary stereocenters (all&#8208;carbon substituents) within cyclic frameworks, generating acyclic quaternary stereocenters poses a more formidable task due to increased conformational flexibility. Herein, we report an enantioselective synthesis of compounds containing acyclic quaternary stereocenters through an iron&#8208;catalyzed alkylation reaction between an acyclic tertiary alkyl source and an unactivated primary alkyl source. This method not only facilitates the rapid construction of sterically hindered motifs but also effectively enhances the saturation level of the molecule. Key to this method is an outer&#8208;sphere C&#9472;C bond formation mechanism, where enantioselectivity is governed by a cooperative triple catalysis system that combines photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and iron catalysis. A series of compounds featuring acyclic quaternary stereocenters is produced under mild reaction conditions, and various transformations are presented to illustrate the potential applications of this approach. A comprehensive mechanistic study supports the crucial SH2 (bimolecular homolytic substitution) mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective synthesis of compounds featuring an acyclic quaternary stereocenter was achieved through an iron-catalyzed alkylation reaction using unactivated alkyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters. The efficiency of this sterically demanding construction is dictated by an outer-sphere C&#9472;C bond formation mechanism, with enantioselectivity regulated by a cooperative triple catalysis system that integrates photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and iron catalysis.

1,3&#8208;Benzodithiolylium cation was identified as an alcohol&#8208;activating reagent for energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical alkylation, avoiding electron transfer. Photocatalytic deoxygenative coupling reactions of alcohols with diverse oxime carbonates involving selective C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction are presented, including energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven carboimination of alkenes, energy transfer (EnT)/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling, and cyclization cross&#8208;coupling. 








Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;benzodithiolylium (BDT) cation was identified as an efficient hydroxyl&#8208;activating reagent for the photocatalytic deoxygenative radical functionalization of alcohols in the absence of any electron transfer process. A series of unprecedented photocatalytic energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical coupling reactions of alcohols with bifunctional oxime carbonates have been developed based on the activation by BDT. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical sorting followed by C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction facilitates the heteroselective cross&#8208;coupling of two distinct alkyl radicals originating from parallel radical relays. These reactions allow the versatile synthesis of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules, including amino acid derivatives, imines, nitriles, and pyrrolines, by using ubiquitous alcohols as regiodefined alkyl building blocks.

         <title>Oligoether Chain Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhancing Transport Pathways and Oxygen Reduction Activity for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligoether chain engineering in covalent organic frameworks with hydrophilic ethylene oxide&#8208;based structures enhances mass diffusion and facilitates the formation of OOH* intermediate in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics and high selectivity for the two&#8208;electron pathway in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
Oligoethers with various numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) units, known for their flexibility, electronegativity, and hydrophilicity, can be leveraged to construct complex molecular architectures with broad applicability. In this study, we present the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating oligoethers with EO segments of varying lengths (2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EOs) to explore the role of EO units in modulating the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway for electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. By embedding hydrophilic EO side chains into the hydrophobic frameworks, intermolecular interactions are promoted through hydrogen bonding, leading to the self&#8208;assembly and spatial aggregation of these side chains. The high crystallinity of the COFs facilitates orderly stacking of the skeleton, creating hydrophilic nanoscale transport channels that enhance ORR kinetics. Among the synthesized COFs, 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EO1, which contains one EO group, exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 5820&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of 89.2%. Theoretical calculations and in situ electrocatalytic experiments reveal that the elongation of the EO units significantly alters the electronic structure of carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen atoms, lowering the energy barriers associated with the formation of OOH* intermediates and thus promoting the 2e&#8722; ORR pathway. This work offers valuable insights into optimizing COFs with different EO units for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR&#8208;based electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Pathways for Sustainable and Cleaner Recovery of Precious Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient photocatalytic recovery of precious metals from waste catalysts is achieved using decatungstates ([W10O32]4&#8722;) and advanced solvent control, enabling a &#8764;100% platinum recovery efficiency with sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly methods.








Abstract
The recovery of precious metals from waste streams is crucial for sustainable resource utilization but remains hindered by traditional methods involving high toxicity, energy consumption, and environmental pollution. Here, we present a photocatalytic strategy employing hydrothermally synthesized decatungstate ([W10O32]4&#8722;) homogeneous ion catalysts to achieve simultaneous oxidation and reduction of precious metals under ambient conditions. This innovative approach integrates solvent&#8208;controlled reaction pathways, enabling efficient dissolution and recovery of precious metals from diverse waste sources, including electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), platinum membrane electrodes, and platinum&#8208;containing catalysts. The decatungstate catalyst exhibits exceptional performance, with an apparent quantum yield of 0.027%&#8212;nearly double that of commercial TiO2 (0.014%)&#8212;and achieves recovery efficiency of 80%&#8211;100% for platinum, surpassing 21 tested photocatalysts. The process adheres to a solid&#8208;phase dissolution model and remains against ionic interference. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations corroborate experimental UV&#8211;vis spectra, while electron&#8208;hole pair analyses elucidate atomic and molecular contributions to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) further validates the thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction pathways. By combining high efficiency, ambient operational conditions, and scalability, this work establishes decatungstates as a sustainable benchmark for green precious metal recovery, addressing the limitations of traditional methods and advancing innovation in resource circularity.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries via Using I&#8722;&#8208;Based Active Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;organic battery (Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 battery) is developed by using an I&#8722;&#8208;based active cathodic electrolyte. Benefiting from the high redox potential of the I&#8722;/I0 redox couple, the Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 cell harvests a high average discharge voltage (0.75&#160;V vs. Zn/Zn2+) and outstanding cycling stability at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Organic cathodes possess inherent structural diversity and fast redox kinetics, showing great application prospects in aqueous Zn batteries. Nevertheless, most of the reported organic cathodes display low average working voltage resulting in poor energy density. Herein, diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN)@CMK&#8208;3 composite is utilized as cathode for aqueous zinc battery, which combines the Zn2+ and H+ co&#8208;storage and I&#8722;/I0 conversion by introducing I&#8722;&#8208;based active additive into 0.5&#160;M Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte. The in situ/ex situ analyses and computational studies disclose that HATN@CMK&#8208;3 with C&#9552;N groups not only stores Zn2+ and H+ ions at low potential but also acts as a substrate to promote the conversion reaction of I&#8722;/I0 at high potential. Accordingly, the Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 cell delivers a high average voltage of 0.75&#160;V, prominent long&#8208;life (10&#160;000 cycles) and, high energy density (198&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, under high mass loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) or low&#8208;temperature conditions, the cell still achieves decent capacity and cycle stability.

Benefiting from the high redox potential of the I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; redox couple, the Zn//HATN@CMK-3 cell harvests a high average discharge voltage (0.75&#160;V vs. Zn/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and outstanding cycling stability at a high mass-loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic cathodes possess inherent structural diversity and fast redox kinetics, showing great application prospects in aqueous Zn batteries. Nevertheless, most of the reported organic cathodes display low average working voltage resulting in poor energy density. Herein, diquinoxalino [2,3-a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-c] phenazine (HATN)@CMK-3 composite is utilized as cathode for aqueous zinc battery, which combines the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-storage and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; conversion by introducing I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-based active additive into 0.5&#160;M Zn(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte. The in situ/ex situ analyses and computational studies disclose that HATN@CMK-3 with C&#9552;N groups not only stores Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions at low potential but also acts as a substrate to promote the conversion reaction of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; at high potential. Accordingly, the Zn//HATN@CMK-3 cell delivers a high average voltage of 0.75&#160;V, prominent long-life (10&#160;000 cycles) and, high energy density (198&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Remarkably, under high mass loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or low-temperature conditions, the cell still achieves decent capacity and cycle stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
We report the first bis(pinacolato)diboron&#8208;enabled Ni&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to synthetically valuable chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols via axial chirality transfer to central chirality. A broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules, and diverse transformations highlight the utility of this reaction.








Abstract
Chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols are important structural motifs in functional materials, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive molecules. Hence, developing efficient methodologies for synthesizing compounds featuring these privileged scaffolds represents a crucial pursuit within synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a regio&#8208; and enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols with high levels of regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity via axial chirality transfer to central chirality. The utilization of an environmentally sustainable bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) is crucial for the success of this asymmetric reductive cyclization reaction. Simultaneously, the mild reaction environment greatly enhances functional group compatibility. This has been demonstrated by the broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of bioactive compounds or drug molecules, and subsequent transformations. Amongst, it is worth emphasizing that these functionally enriched chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols can efficiently participate in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions to synthesize enantioenriched polycyclic and heterocyclic molecules, thereby further validating the significance of introducing a cyclopentadiene skeleton. The preliminary mechanistic studies revealed the mode of action of B2pin2 in mononuclear Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation reactions and density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified the origin of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Optimizing Charge Separated Synergistic Binding Sites in Self&#8208;Healing Crystalline Porous Organic Salts for Benchmark Trace Alkyne/Alkene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 24, June 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;separated, self&#8208;healing, crystalline, porous organic salt with multiple optimizing synergistic electropositive and electronegative sites is reported for benchmark short&#8208;chain alkyne/alkene separation with record selectivity.








Abstract
The separation of trace alkyne (C2H2/C3H4) impurities from alkenes (C2H4/C3H6) is a significant but challenging process to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 and C3H6. Herein, we reported an optimally designed charge&#8208;separated organic framework, crystalline porous organic salt (CPOS&#8208;1), with confined polar channels for highly efficient alkyne/alkene separation. CPOS&#8208;1 exhibits excellent stability, remarkably high C2H2 (18.4&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and C3H4 (20.9&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) uptakes at 0.01&#160;bar and 298&#160;K, and benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (25.1) and C3H4/C3H6 (43.9) separation selectivities for 1/99 alkyne/alkene mixtures. The practical alkyne/alkene separation performance was completely identified by breakthrough&#8208;column experiments under various conditions with excellent cycle stability and high alkene productivities (C2H4: 216.6&#160;L&#160;kg&#8722;1; C3H6: 162.4&#160;L&#160;kg&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations indicated that pore aperture in CPOS&#8208;1 acts as a tailored single&#8208;molecule trap, where alkynes are captured by multiple synergistic electropositive and electronegative sites, thus enhancing alkyne recognition. Furthermore, the ease of rehealing facilitates its practical application, transcending the limitations of the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs).

In this scientific perspective, we intend to provide a coherent framework for the field of magnetocatalysis by highlighting opportunities associated with the use of magnetic fields to activate catalysts. A particular focus will be placed on magnetically induced catalysis, providing an overview on current advances and identifying scientific and technical challenges on the path toward a widespread use of this technology in research and industry.








Abstract
The rapidly growing importance of electrification in the chemical industry opens room for disruptive innovations regarding energy input into catalytic processes. Energy efficiency and dynamics of renewable energy supplies represent important challenges, but the design of catalytic systems to cope with such new frameworks may also stimulate the discovery of new catalyst materials and reaction pathways. In this context, many opportunities arise when catalysts are activated in a rapid, localized, and energy&#8208;efficient manner. Among the various concepts to achieve adaptivity in catalysis, magnetic induction heating applied directly at the catalyst or in vicinity of the active site has gained increasing attention recently. In this Scientific Perspective, we provide a coherent framework to the emerging field of catalysis using magnetic fields&#8212;and in particular alternating current magnetic fields&#8212;to activate catalytic materials and define it as magnetically induced catalysis. Promising approaches and selected examples are described to illustrate the scientific concept and to highlight its broad potential for innovation in catalysis from laboratory to industrial scale.

         <title>Scalable and Practical Electrooxidation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Methylarenes to Access Aromatic Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic aldehydes are pivotal synthetic intermediates with applications in fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. While the oxidation of methylarenes represents an ideal route to aromatic aldehydes due to the availability of starting materials, existing methods face significant challenges, including reliance on hazardous oxidants, costly catalysts, poor scalability, and limited compatibility with electron&#8208;deficient substrates. To address these limitations, we report a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron&#8208;deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach operates under industrially viable conditions&#8212;high current densities (75 mA cm&#8722;2), minimal electrolyte loading (0.05 equiv), and operation in an undivided cell without additives&#8212;to produce aromatic acetals, which are readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehydes. The use of minimal electrolyte not only reduces costs and simplifies product isolation but also significantly enhances anodic oxidation selectivity, ensuring high efficiency and practicality. This protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, compatibility with both batch and continuous flow systems, and exceptional scalability, as demonstrated by successful kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis.</dc:description>

To address these limitations, we report a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron-deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. This approach operates under industrially viable conditions&#8212;high current densities (75 mA cm&#8722;2), minimal electrolyte loading (0.05 equiv), and operation in an undivided cell without additives&#8212;to produce aromatic acetals, which are readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehydes. The use of minimal electrolyte not only reduces costs and simplifies product isolation but also significantly enhances anodic oxidation selectivity, ensuring high efficiency and practicality. This protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, compatibility with both batch and continuous flow systems, and exceptional scalability, as demonstrated by successful kilogram-scale synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Distortion Promoting Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Emissions in Cu(I)&#8208;Based Halides for Thermography and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>

         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides as a chemically tunable platform achieve multi&#8208;functional optical applications with versatile luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we design and prepare Cu(I)&#8208;based hybrid halide (DMAP)Cu3I4 (DMAP = 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine), with ambient temperature&#8208;induced photoluminescence evolution from red to near&#8208;infrared emissions. The in&#8208;situ variable&#8208;temperature crystallographic study reveals lattice distortion with more disordered [Cu3nI4n]n&#8208; units appear at high temperature, further indicating that the observed wavelength&#8208;tunable emission is attributed to transitions from Cu cluster center to halogen&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. Thus, (DMAP)Cu3I4 shows a compelling thermometric precision (high sensitivities of 0.0001&#8208;0.6 K&#8208;1) at a wide temperature range of 80&#8211;300 K. In particular, the remote thermography is established with a high spatial resolution of ~20 lp mm&#8208;1 by processable thin films. These findings enhance the potential for molecular&#8208;level illumination in Cu(I)&#8208;based halides and contribute to the exploration of their optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Twist&#8208;Promoted Photoredox Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frame&#8208;work for Defluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relatively short excited&#8208;state lifetime is one main drawback of organic photosensitizers, resulting in their restricted catalytic capability and high catalyst loadings. We herein report the design of a twisted ligand N9,N9,N10,N10&#8208;tetrakis[(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid]&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthracene diamine (H4TCPDA). Its twisted geometry significantly elongates the lifetime of charge&#8208;transfer state as substantiated by detailed ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic and electrochemical studies. Moreover, its rigid structure benefits the formation of highly crystalline Y&#8208;TCPDA metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with excellent stability toward F&#8208; solutions. Therefore, Y&#8208;TCPDA competently catalyzes chemoselective defluorinative modifications, a challenge remained in MOF catalysis, and olefin reductive cross&#8208;coupling with high turnover numbers of up to 9000. Control experiments underscore the protection of organic photocatalytic centers by the MOF platform, while similar organic catalysts are found to be decomposed in a homogeneous catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct activation of sulfides by C&#8211;H oxidation with photoexcited nitroarenes: Formal manipulations of the C&#8211;S bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfide motif is distributed widely across chemical and biological space. In synthesis, its installation often marks the end point of a sequence, due to its relative inertness; sulfides typically require direct oxidation of sulfur before they are receptive towards transformation. Unfortunately, selective&#160;S&#8208;oxidation is not always straightforward, with the need for oxidants lacking chemoselectivity in the presence of functionality and delivering mixtures of oxidation products. This multi&#8208;step manipulation of the sulfide motif, initiated by direct&#160;S&#8208;oxidation, limits the use of sulfides as synthetic handles for downstream manipulation. Herein, we describe a direct activation of sulfides by C&#8211;H oxidation alpha to sulfur &#8211; rather than traditional oxidation at sulfur &#8211; that facilitates efficient formal C&#8211;S bond manipulation. The mild nature of the photo&#8208;induced anaerobic oxidation protocol enables its merger with high&#8208;value transformations in telescoped or one&#8208;pot protocols that deliver branched amines, secondary alcohols, and alkenes from aldehyde and ketone intermediates. The method expands the chemistry of sulfides by diverting reactivity away from sulfur (oxidation, alkylation) and instead targeting directly the alpha position, resulting in formal manipulation of the C&#8211;S bond, and redefining sulfides as latent synthetic handles to be &#8220;switched on&#8221; at will.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Structures and Properties of Overcrowded&#8208;Ethylene Decorated (Diaza)phosphinines via Tunable Main&#8208;Group Element Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating more sophisticated molecular systems that are responsive, dynamic, and controllable through a combination of chemical structure modification and external stimuli represents a pivotal challenge in the development of functional molecular machines. Herein, we report a new series of overcrowded&#8208;ethylene (OCE) decorated (diaza)phosphinines. Combining with the main&#8208;group element and nonplanar OCE structures, new P&#8208;molecules showed the tunable folded(F)/twisted(T)&#8208;conformations and physical properties via the distinct P&#8208;hyperconjugation of the P&#8722;C and P&#8722;N bonds. Such hyperconjugation induced tunability is different from the classical OCEs where p&#8208;&#120587;/&#120587;&#8208;&#120587; conjugation effects are the dominating factors controlling the structures and properties. Furthermore, bromination of NP&#8208;oxide derivative induced an unexpected chemochromic T&#8594;F isomerization, highlighting the dynamic conformation character. Leveraging on the different structures, PC and PN derivatives further enabled the formations of radical cations and anions having different spin characters on the P&#8208;centers. As the new example of P&#8208;Thiele&#8217;s hydrocarbon family, combining the PN structure with the overcrowded anthraquinodimethane structure yielded a light&#8208;responsive open&#8208;shell PN&#8208;anthraquinodimethane diradicaloid with a triplet ground state influenced by the PN hyperconjugation effect in F&#8208;conformation and the aromaticity gain in T&#8208;conformation. Overall, our new strategy of the hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated tunability, paves the way toward complex organic materials with tunable the structures and physical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjustable Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate to Biodegradable Polymer Monomers by Mn&#8208;Catalyzed Solvent Switching Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Waste plastics represent a new resource for the chemical industry. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent&#8208;switching strategy to upcycle waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into monomer terephthalic acid (TPA) and key bulk feedstocks for biodegradable polymers, such as lactic acid (LA), or glycolic acid (GA). PET undergoes rapid and mild depolymerization into its monomers TPA and ethylene glycol (EG) under the catalysis of a manganese complex. When methanol (MeOH) is used as the solvent, it undergoes selective dehydrogenative coupling with in&#8208;situ generated EG, efficiently yielding TPA and LA with yields exceeding 98%. By replacing MeOH with tert&#8208;amyl alcohol (t&#8208;AmOH), PET is quantitatively converted into TPA and GA. The PET conversion mechanism was elucidated through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and molecular model studies. This work presents a sustainable and innovative approach for upcycling waste PET into high&#8208;value products, while open a new route to synthesize biopolymer monomers, which are essential for developing chemically recyclable and biodegradable polymers, thereby advancing the production of sustainable single&#8208;use polymer products.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Versatile DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aldehydes by Controlled Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldehyde&#8208;functionalized oligonucleotides have found diverse applications in chemical biology and material science. However, due to the electrophilic nature of aldehydes, incorporating aldehyde functionalities directly into DNA is challenging, particularly for highly reactive alkyl aldehydes. Inspired by natural oxidases, we herein developed a controlled oxidation strategy to generate aldehyde&#8208;functionalized DNAs from synthetically accessible DNA&#8208;conjugated amines in situ. A broad range of DNA&#8208;conjugated alkyl and aryl aldehydes were efficiently produced from the corresponding amines using O2/laccase/TEMPO, with feasible micromole&#8208;scale preparation. Moreover, combining oxidative cleavage of DNA&#8208;conjugated secondary and tertiary amines with reductive amination enabled switchable amine&#8211;aldehyde transformation and reversible solid&#8208;phase bioconjugation of DNA probes. Furthermore, the reactivity &#8216;umpolung&#8217; from nucleophilic amines to electrophilic aldehydes highlights its potential for synthesizing chemically diverse DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs). In summary, the presented controlled oxidation strategy expands the current toolbox to introduce aldehyde functionalities into DNAs within a chemical biological context.</dc:description>

In summary, the presented controlled oxidation strategy expands the current toolbox to introduce aldehyde functionalities into DNAs within a chemical biological context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Active Pt&#8208;Fe Catalysts Towards CO Preferential Oxidation with an Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;efficiency Pt&#8208;Fe(OH)x/MA catalyst with abundant Pt&#948;+&#8211;(OH)x&#8211;Fe3+ interfacial sites was prepared via topological transformation process of hydrotalcite precursor, which exhibited outstanding catalytic performance towards preferential oxidation of CO with an ultra&#8208;wide full CO conversion window (25&#176;C&#8722;225 &#176;C) at a rather high space velocity (130 000&#160;mL gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1).








Abstract
Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 (CO&#8208;PROX) is a promising solution to remove the residual CO in the feed stream to avoid Pt poisoning in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), in which the development of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts with a wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a Fe(OH)x modified Pt clusters (&#8764;1.6&#160;nm) catalyst supported on MgAlOx (denoted as MA) derived from PtFeMgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxides (PtFeMgAl&#8208;LDHs) precursor, which is featured with abundant Pt&#948;+&#8211;(OH)x&#8211;Fe3+ interfacial sites. Impressively, the optimal catalyst Pt&#8208;Fe(OH)x/MA exhibits exceptional catalytic performance towards CO&#8208;PROX, which can completely remove CO in a H2&#8208;rich stream with an ultra&#8208;wide full CO conversion window (25&#176;C&#8722;225 &#176;C) at a rather high space velocity (130 000&#160;mL gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). The mass&#8208;specific activity reaches to 9.09 molCO gPt&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, which is preponderant to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. In addition, a 240&#160;h stream&#8208;on&#8208;line test over Pt&#8208;Fe(OH)x/MA shows a satisfactory stability. A comprehensive investigation based on in situ experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveals that the &#8211;OH group at the Pt&#948;+&#8211;(OH)x&#8211;Fe3+ interfacial site is easily bound to the linearly&#8208;adsorbed CO at the adjacent Pt&#948;+ site to form carboxylate intermediate, followed by its decomposition to CO2. Meanwhile, the generated coordination unsaturated Fe2+ site facilitates the activation cracking of O2 molecule without energy barrier. A structure design strategy of interfacial synergistic catalysis towards CO&#8208;PROX is proposed in this work, which shows fundamental significance and application prospects in hydrogen purification.

         <title>Engineering Robust Hydrophilic&#8211;Hydrophobic Interface via &#960;&#8208;electron Delocalization for Ultralong&#8208;Lived Zinc&#8211;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization strategy is proposed to in&#8208;situ construct the self&#8208;assembled hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic interface layer (HHIL) on Zn anode after structure screening of additives. HHIL derived by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and ion&#8211;dipole interactions promote the generation of inorganic&#8208;rich interfacial chemistry during cycling. The flexible HHIL and rigid inorganic&#8208;rich interface affords the highly reversible Zn anode and ultralong&#8208;lived aqueous zinc ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are hindered by the severe interfacial issues of Zn anode such as side reactions and dendrite growth. The in&#8208;situ construction of robust interface to tackle above issues remains a grand challenge and lacks rational design principles, especially under high current density. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization strategy is proposed to in&#8208;situ construct the self&#8208;assembled hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic interface layer (HHIL) for ultralong&#8208;lived AZIBs, where interface design principles are built based on the electronic structure and spatial configuration of additives. Encouragingly, HHIL derived by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and ion&#8211;dipole interactions is robust during long&#8208;term cycling and facilitates the generation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interface chemistry. The flexible HHIL and rigid inorganic&#8208;rich interface afford the rapid interface kinetics, and effectively suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth. Notably, Zn//Zn cells deliver the cycling life over 900 h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, and Zn//NVO full cells stably perform over 25&#160;000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the practical pouch cell is also demonstrated.

         <title>Topologically Entangled Network Polymer Electrolyte with Ionophilic&#8211;Protonation Dual Side Chains for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A segmented polymerization strategy combining DBRP and ROP constructs a topologically entangled polymer electrolyte with ionophilic&#8211;protonation dual side chains on an electrospun skeleton. The ionophilic moieties provide abundant coordination sites, significantly enhancing Li+ transport, whereas exposed carboxyl groups induce protonation on the cathode surface via H+/Li+ exchange, thereby suppressing transition metal (TM) ion migration. Simultaneously, the topologically entangled polymer network ensures uniform electric&#8208;field distribution and continuous Li&#8314; conduction, mitigating lattice&#8208;oxygen release and enhancing structural stability under high&#8208;voltage conditions.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (HVSSLMBs) is severely limited by unstable ion transport, insufficient oxidative stability, and poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) compatibility of conventional solid electrolytes. Herein, we report a topologically entangled polymer electrolyte featuring ionophilic&#8211;protonation dual side chains. The ionophilic functional groups on these side chains provide abundant coordination sites, significantly enhancing Li+ transport, whereas exposed carboxyl (&#9472;COOH) groups induce protonation on the cathode surface, effectively suppressing transition metal (TM) ion migration. The topologically entangled polymer network ensures uniform electric&#8208;field distribution, mitigates lattice&#8208;oxygen release, and maintains continuous Li+ conduction. As a result, this electrolyte achieves a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.81 mS cm&#8722;1 and an oxidation stability up to 4.9&#160;V. Moreover, the in situ formed inorganic species (LiF, Li2O, and Li2CO3) stabilized the EEI, enabling stable cycling of the symmetric cell for 2000 h. Batteries assembled with a high&#8208;voltage Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 (LRMO) cathode retain a specific capacity of 217.37 mAh g&#8722;1 after 250 cycles, and Ah&#8208;level pouch cell utilizing LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode exhibits stable cycling performance over 150 cycles. These findings demonstrate the great promise of this strategy for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries with outstanding cycling performance and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Branching&#8208;Induced Intermolecular Repulsion Effects Drive Stable and Sustainable Flow Batteries on Condensed Nitroxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We firstly propose a side&#8208;chain engineering strategy featuring a branched dual&#8208;ammonium structure for nitroxyl radical&#8208;based aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). This design enhances the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion of nitroxyl radicals by increasing &#8764;40% of binding energy barrier, thereby suppressing side reactions associated with molecular aggregation.

Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) play a critical role in scalable energy storage applications where safety, cost, and lifetime matter most. However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, breaking from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain&#8208;branched dual&#8208;ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs. Paired with a viologen anolyte, the AORFBs with condensed electrolytes deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (99.85%/day) and a peak power density of 140.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. In situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible characterization and theoretical simulation elucidate that the branched dual&#8208;ammonium structure accelerates &#8764;40% of the binding energy barrier, thereby enhancing intermolecular electrostatic repulsion. This effect effectively inhibits side reactions triggered by nucleophilic attacks, particularly in condensed nitroxyl radicals, maintaining the structural stability of both radical and oxoammonium states as well as their reversible transformations. Our redox organic formulation offers a direction towards stable and high&#8208;energy density AORFBs that seamlessly integrate eco&#8208;friendliness, durability, and sustainability.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Metal Ce&#8208;Zr&#8208;Mn Clusters as Photo&#8208;Catalysts for Decarboxylative Functionalization of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative hydrazination of carboxylic acids was achieved using a 1:5:2 ratio of three metal salts, Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3, as a catalyst under visible light irradiation. The catalytic activity, compared with our previously developed Ce6 cluster photo&#8208;catalysts, was enhanced by the formation of single cerium&#8208;incorporated hexanuclear mixed&#8208;metal clusters containing a [CeZr5O4(OH)4]12+ core. The manganese salts further accelerated the overall reaction rate (10 times faster reaction rate with the manganese salt than that of the manganese&#8208;free conditions). Using the isolated cluster, CeZr5O4(OH)4(OCOCH2tBu)12(HOCOCH2tBu)4 (4a), with Mn(OAc)3, phenol and thiophenol&#8208;containing carboxylic acids were transformed to their decarboxylative hydrazinated products in moderate to high yields, while a mixture of Ce6O4(OH)4(OCOCH2tBu)12(HOCOCH2tBu)4 (4c) and Mn(OAc)3 or Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3 yielded lower amounts of the products. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating cerium(IV) into the zirconium&#8208;based core to tolerate these easily oxidizable functional groups. Moreover, decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids under air followed by treatment with NaBH4 resulted in the production of one&#8208;carbon shortened alcohols in excellent yields when using Ce(OtBu)4 and Zr(OtBu)4 or Hf(OtBu)4 in a 1:5 ratio: the reaction rates were 8 to 10 times higher than that of the previously developed cerium&#8208;catalyzed reaction under identical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar&#8208;Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While birefringence phase&#8208;matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;n &lt; 0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&#955; &lt; 280 nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite&#8208;based NLO crystals, (C2N4OH7)H2PO3 (GUPO) and C(NH2)3H2PO3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guanidinium cations and [H2PO3]&#8315; anions enables record&#8208;breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates.&#160;Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full&#8208;wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm.&#160; Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 &#215; KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO&#160;at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing demand for information security in the digital era has accelerated the development of novel encryption materials, among which optically responsive systems have emerged as particularly promising candidates due to their exceptional tunability and non&#8208;invasive characteristics. However, current optical encryption materials remain largely confined to static or binary states, presenting a fundamental challenge in achieving precisely controlled hierarchically responses for developing high&#8208;capacity, multi&#8208;level encrypted materials. Herein,&#160;we successfully construct a novel class of dynamically multi&#8208;level responsive luminescent materials driven by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and apply them to a multi&#8208;level information encryption system.&#160;The highly efficient host&#8208;guest complexation between 4&#8208;phenylpyridine&#8208;functionalized isoquinoline derivatives (IQP) and macrocyclic molecule CB[8] enables the construction of linear supramolecular polymers (IQP&#8834;CB[8]).&#160;Affected by the dynamic protonation of isoquinoline and the host&#8208;guest interaction, the monomer and polymer exhibit the characteristics of multicolor luminescence.&#160;Furthermore, IQP can undergo a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction in the confined space of CB[8], it can reversibly transform from a conjugated supramolecular polymer to a non&#8208;conjugated polyrotaxane, and shows pronounced optical response on the time gradient.&#160;Consequently,&#160;this light,&#160;heat, acid/base&#8208;sensitive supramolecular system exhibits reversible responsiveness and time&#8208;dependent characteristics, thereby establishing a multi&#8208;channel fluorescent cascade encryption platform capable of multi&#8208;level information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Ligand Exchange for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Transfer Hydrothiocarbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transfer hydrocarbonylation of alkenes could streamline the synthesis of value&#8208;added carbonylated molecules by avoiding the use of pressurized toxic CO. Existing methods, however, are limited to the use of alcohol&#8208;derived formates or anhydrides as CO and nucleophile&#8208;surrogates, because the parallel mechanism does not work for other transfer carbonylation reagents comprising nucleophilic fragments with higher coordination affinities to transition metals. Herein, we present a novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy to address this challenge by promoting the ligand exchange via facilitating the dissociation of CO instead of nucleophiles, upon which was also an efficient transfer hydrothiocarbonylation of olefins with thioformates successfully established. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, excellent regioselectivities, broad functional group compatibilities, and vital synthetic efficacy. The kinetic analysis unveiled a striking linear correlation between the product concentration and the time&#8208;squared. Furthermore, the kinetic behaviors observed for the substrates were all consistent with the rate law derived from the proposed mechanism. These results demonstrated the pivotal importance of rapid CO dissociation via light excitation to suppress the side reaction of premature reductive elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Unspecific Peroxygenases for Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation of &#946;&#8209;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization. Compared to cytochrome P450s, the catalytic potential of UPOs has been less investigated, largely due to their limited natural diversity and the challenges associated with their optimization through enzyme engineering. In this study, we engineered an UPO from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8209;ketoesters, a valuable transformation yet to be realized in biocatalysis. Through enzyme engineering, two AniUPO variants, AniUPO&#8208;M3 and AniUPO&#8208;M6, were developed to produce a wide range of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, achieving up to 97% yield, 4140 total turnover number (TTN), and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio (er). The biocatalytic process operates under mild conditions and is scalable for preparative applications. This study broadens the catalytic repertoire of UPOs and enhances their potential for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Intermediates Spillover Boosts Electrochemical Nitrate Conversion to Ammonia over Dual Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate conversion to ammonia driven by sustainable green electricity is regarded as a promising supplement to the traditional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is still restricted by the low NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency. Here, we propose a continuous intermediates spillover strategy by constructing dual single&#8208;atom alloy to boost ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency. The intermediates continuously spill over back and forth on the atomically dispersed Mo and Fe sites in Pd lattice, which adaptively experiences low energy barrier for each elementary step in nitrate conversion. As a result, the synthesized dual single&#8208;atom alloy metallene delivered an NH3 yield rate of 13.4 mol gcat.&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, and Faradaic efficiency of 94.6%, as well as remarkable cycling stability of 300 hours. Furthermore, the dual single&#8208;atom alloy metallene was assembled into a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as the cathode, which delivered an output voltage of 1.477 V, and the maximum output power density of 13.4 mW cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Integration of Functionalized Bridges by One&#8208;step Superacid&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction to Fabricate Porous Polymers for CO2 Capture and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of ultra&#8208;microporous functionalized porous organic polymers (POPs) was developed starting from glyoxylic acid as a cross&#8208;linker and triflic acid as a catalyst on polyaromatic monomers, generating in situ methine bridges with carboxylic acids. This one&#8208;pot synthetic method generated functionalized POPs with high connectivity per each aromatic group and a high density of aliphatic carboxylic acids decorating the pore walls. Remarkably, the functional groups were transformed into esters, Na&#8208; and Li&#8208;carboxylates by post&#8208;synthetic modification with high yields, generating polyionic porous polymers. These porous polymers displayed excellent CO2 adsorption at 298 K and isosteric heat of adsorption with values as high as 50 kJ mol&#8208;1 for the Na&#8208;containing POP endowed with numerous ionic charges, as estimated by direct measurements with microcalorimetry coupled to CO2 adsorption isotherms. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on self&#8208;supporting monolithic composites demonstrated high selectivity for CO2 adsorption over N2 up to 500 for diluted streams and 340 under relevant conditions for carbon capture from flue gases (0.15 CO2 partial pressure).</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design and Synthesis of Narrowband Near&#8208;Ultraviolet and Pure Deep&#8208;Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials by an Ether Group Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are promising materials for the development of displays due to their multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) with narrowband emission. However, except for electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions, synthetic strategies for the generation of boron&#8208;containing MR&#8208;TADF molecules remain virtually unexplored. In particular, the synthesis of MR&#8208;TADF emitters that exhibit narrow near&#8208;ultraviolet and pure deep&#8208;blue emission constitutes a challenging task. Here, we present a directed tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;lithiation&#8211;borylation approach that provides a new family of N,N&#8208;bridge&#8208;type triphenylboranes that bear phenylimino groups instead of the methylene groups at the 8&#8208; and 14&#8208;positions and ether groups instead of the hydrogen atoms at the 3&#8208; and 19&#8208;positions of 1&#8208;borapentacyclohenicosanonaene. The effects of the electron&#8208;donating resonance of the oxygen atoms of the ether groups and the incorporation of oxygen atoms in the six&#8208;membered cycle allow the precise tuning of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps, resulting in narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet and pure deep&#8208;blue TADF with Commission&#8208;International&#8208;de&#8208;l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates (CIEx,y) of (0.142&#8211;0.160, 0.029&#8211;0.063) for the photoluminescence (PL) and (0.146&#8211;0.160, 0.026&#8211;0.053) for the electroluminescence (EL). The CIEx,y for the EL meet the BT.2020 requirement for the blue primary of ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Relay&#8208;Enhanced Electron Transfer in Triple&#8208;Layer Ru@Ir@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for the Ammonia Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is important for enabling the efficient use of NH3 as a promising carrier for hydrogen storage and transportation. However, the catalytic activity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based catalysts decreases significantly due to the strong adsorption of N species. In this study, a triple&#8208;layer core&#8210;shell structured Ru@Ir@Pt model catalyst was employed to demonstrate that the relay electron transfer strategy can decelerate the adsorption of N species and increase AOR activity, a process facilitated by the built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) induced by differing work functions that drive the sequential relay of charge transfer across the interfaces between different metals. In situ FTIR revealed that AOR proceeds primarily via the N2H4 pathway of the G&#8210;M mechanism. Both the experimental and theoretical simulation results confirm that relay electron transfer strategy&#160;enables the outermost Pt electron&#8208;rich state to reduce the intensity of N adsorbed species and lower the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step in the AOR, resulting in excellent activity with a mass activity reaching up to 353.7 A&#183;g&#8211;1. This value is 5.24 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C and significantly surpasses most previously reported catalysts. This work presents a novel material design approach for developing high&#8208;performance advanced ammonia oxidation electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Conjugated Polymers by Selective Methyl/Methylene C&#8208;H Activation on Gold Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene (C=C) linkage facilitates the distribution of highly conjugated electrons along the polymer chain, thereby playing a crucial role in the development of conductive polymers for promising applications in organic electronics. Directly connecting two methyl groups to construct a vinylene linkage would streamline the synthesis process considerably, reducing the number of reaction steps required. However, reactions through alkyl groups normally form C&#8208;C single bonds as linkages. Achieving vinylene bonds via further dehydrogenation remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of vinylene linkages by selectively activating methyl/methylene C&#8208;H bonds using the predesigned monomers bearing methylthiophenes on Au(111) and Au(110) surfaces. Non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy confirms the formation of vinylene linkage by bond&#8208;resolved imaging on both surfaces, achieving a vinylene linkage yield of 97.3%. Density functional theory calculations and control experiments reveal that the strong adsorption of the thiophene ring on the gold substrate effectively reduces the energy barriers for methyl and methylene C&#8208;H dissociation, enabling the two&#8208;step dehydrogenation for the formation of vinylene&#8208;linked polymers with up to 27 units. Our findings present a novel strategy for polymerization or oligomerization via vinylene linkages on surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Diffusion Kinetics and Interfacial Stability via In&#8208;Situ Constructed Self&#8208;Healing Interfaces for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial Zn anodes contain inherent manufacturing defects, such as scratches, rough surfaces, fold lines and microcracks. These surface defects damage the uniformity of the interfacial electric field, exacerbate hydrogen evolution problem and dendrite growth. Herein, a self&#8208;healing polymer interface is constructed by unsaturated N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide molecules (NHMA) self&#8208;polymerization. The layer effectively suppresses the detrimental tip effect and enhances the interface stability. Meanwhile, it synergistically facilitates the diffusion kinetics of Zn ions and regulates orientated deposition, thereby enabling an efficient repair of scratches on the Zn surface. Furthermore, the NHMA with acylamino and hydroxyl groups is capable of modulating the hydrogen bond network and solvation structure of the electrolyte, further improving the stability of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Benefit from the enhanced diffusion kinetics and stable NHMA&#8208;derived interfaces, the fabricated symmetrical battery demonstrates a 50&#8208;fold improvement in cycle life under various testing conditions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Commercial Zn anodes contain inherent manufacturing defects, such as scratches, rough surfaces, fold lines and microcracks. These surface defects damage the uniformity of the interfacial electric field, exacerbate hydrogen evolution problem and dendrite growth. Herein, a self-healing polymer interface is constructed by unsaturated N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide molecules (NHMA) self-polymerization. The layer effectively suppresses the detrimental tip effect and enhances the interface stability. Meanwhile, it synergistically facilitates the diffusion kinetics of Zn ions and regulates orientated deposition, thereby enabling an efficient repair of scratches on the Zn surface. Furthermore, the NHMA with acylamino and hydroxyl groups is capable of modulating the hydrogen bond network and solvation structure of the electrolyte, further improving the stability of the electrode-electrolyte interface. Benefit from the enhanced diffusion kinetics and stable NHMA-derived interfaces, the fabricated symmetrical battery demonstrates a 50-fold improvement in cycle life under various testing conditions. Moreover, the full battery can maintain a capacity of 101.8 mAh g-1 after 3000 cycles at 5 A g-1 (1.5 times higher than bare Zn//NH4V4O10). This work establishes a novel framework for rational electrolyte engineering and interfacial modulation in aqueous Zn metal batteries, offering fresh perspectives for future research toward practical energy storage applications&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Birefringence and Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Transmission by Coordination&#8208;Induced Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Pyridine&#8211;Carboxylate</title>

An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid uniformly&#8208;stacked 2D crystal [Be2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(C7H3NO4)(H2O)]&#183;H2O involving hydrogen bond synthons was designed and successfully synthesized, exhibiting strong covalent tetra&#8208;coordinated BeII cations that coordinate with the O and N atoms on birefringence&#8208;active &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; organic groups with optimal spatial arrangement. The crystal demonstrates unprecedented birefringence in the solar&#8208;blind wide UV&#8208;transparent region.








Abstract
Giant birefringent crystal with large bandgap is of paramount importance for modern optical devices but simultaneous achievement of giant birefringence and large bandgap is a great challenge stemming from their inherent contradictory relationship according to Kramers&#8210;Kronig equation. Herein, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid uniformly&#8208;stacked 2D crystal [Be2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(C7H3NO4)(H2O)]&#183;H2O (I) was successfully synthesized by a molecular crystal engineering involving hydrogen bond synthons. Layered I features new [Be2O2N(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(H2O)]&#8734; helical chain composed of BeII tetrahedral coordination, and the strong covalent BeII cations coordinate with the O and N atoms on birefringence&#8208;active &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; organic groups with optimal spatial arrangement. As a result, I demonstrates the largest birefringence of 0.6 in the solar&#8208;blind UV spectral region, with large bandgap of 4.75&#160;eV and short UV absorption edge of 261&#160;nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses uncover that the superior optical properties mainly originate from collective effects of highly&#8208;active (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; groups, distorted Be&#8208;tetrahedral units, and their uniform stacking. This work not only provides a potential solar&#8208;blind UV birefringent crystal for rapidly increasing number of optical applications but also a new chance for the rational design of wide UV giant birefringent crystals.

         <title>Deciphering&#160;the N&#9472;N Coupling Mechanism Over Iron&#8211;Copper Alloy Catalysts During Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In ammonia decomposition, the initial dehydrogenation of adsorbed NH3 and the desorption of nitrogen atoms are two elementary reactions that proceed via competing activation pathways. This study demonstrates that alloying Fe with metals that have a low nitrogen binding energy optimizes the dissociation of NH3 and the binding ability of N* intermediates in the ammonia decomposition reaction process, and new insights are provided for rationally designing Fe&#8208;based catalysts with improved activity and stability.








Abstract
The production of COx&#8208;free hydrogen via the ammonia decomposition reaction (ADR) using Fe&#8208;based non&#8208;precious metal catalysts has attracted much attention. N&#9472;H bond cleavage and N&#9472;N coupling are two key steps in ADR, however, stronger Fe&#9472;N binding leads to lower activity of iron catalysts. Herein, we develop FeCu alloy catalysts with optimized metal&#8208;nitrogen binding energy by incorporating Cu, a metal with inherently weaker nitrogen affinity, into Fe&#8208;based catalysts. The optimized Fe1Cu0.5/MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 139.1&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 550&#160;&#176;C under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV&#160;=&#160;360&#160;000&#160;h&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that the modulation of the d&#8208;band structure due to the alloying effect optimizes the dissociation of NH3 and the binding ability of N* intermediates in the ADR process. Notably, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) combined with theoretical calculations confirm that FeCu alloying effectively reduces the N&#9472;N recombination energy barrier from 2.25&#160;eV (Fe cluster) to 1.77&#160;eV (FeCu cluster). These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of highly active Fe&#8208;based catalysts for efficient ammonia decomposition and sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Material Recycling/Upcycling of Polyamide Waste Enabled by Cosolvent&#8208;Tunable Dissolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical recycling of polyamides (PAs) requires high temperatures due to solvent resistance. Rapid dissolution of PAs in formic acid (FA) using a cosolvent strategy enables room&#8208;temperature recycling and upcycling for utilization of high&#8208;value resources. The weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonding nature of the cosolvent regulates FA's cluster formation and enhances solvation of crystalline PA.








Abstract
Polyamides (PAs, nylons) are a ubiquitous class of high&#8208;performance plastics used extensively in a wide range of applications. Their high resistance to many common solvents and tendency to hydrolyze in strong acids or bases creates a major hurdle to low&#8208;emissions material recycling (i.e., resource separation and recovery). In the present study, the first detailed investigation into the molecular mechanisms of polyamide dissolution, we show that introducing a weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonding cosolvent into formic acid can effectively tune the solvent&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8211;polymer interactions, drastically accelerates the room&#8208;temperature dissolution kinetics of common (short&#8208;chain) polyamides such as PA6 and PA66, as well as long&#8208;chain and semi&#8208;aromatic varieties. The recovered polymers show no change in their chemical structures or properties, and sufficient selectivity allows for fillers such as short and long fibers, inorganic nanoparticles, metals, and other mixed polymer phases to be recovered at high efficiency (&gt;95%) along with recirculation of all solvents (&gt;98%). This cosolvent&#8208;enabled approach has the potential to make polyamide recycling more sustainable and economical by reducing the energy input and CO2 emissions required to separate and recover the various constituent materials from automotive and electrical components, textiles, and beyond.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutics. Here, we present an ultrasensitive single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy assay combined with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics to study membrane permeabilization in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs).








Abstract
Cell membrane disruption is associated with numerous diseases and underlies the activity of various antimicrobial agents. The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutic drugs. Here, we present a single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy assay integrated with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics to study membrane permeabilization in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing as few as seven dye molecules. This assay eliminates the need for liposome immobilization and achieves detection rates in the range of 1000 vesicles per minute, offering unparalleled sensitivity and detection limits as low as 135 pM, corresponding to just eight permeabilizing molecules per vesicle for active compounds such as ionomycin. It provides a robust platform for investigating membrane&#8208;disrupting agents, including those with antimicrobial properties or implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Benzaldoxime Synthesis by Glutathione&#8208;Modified CdS Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis offers an efficient, energy&#8208;saving and environmentally&#8208;friendly pathway for benzaldoxime synthesis. Inspired by the secondary coordination sphere of nitrite reductase, we report herein the first photocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis from NO2&#8208; and benzyl alcohol. Different from introducing co&#8208;catalysts, the integration of glutathione (GSH) relay with CdS quantum dots (QDs) can effectively mediate hole transfer and facilitate selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. At the same time, GSH assists continuous proton transfer to promote selective 4e&#8208;/5H+ NO2&#8208; reduction and form NH2OH in&#8208;situ. As a result, the synergic C&#8208;N coupling delivers a series of benzyl oximes from NO2&#8208; and benzyl alcohols with excellent yield and selectivity. Benzaldoxime synthesis proceeds at a rate of 18.7 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and TON of 52,875, accomplishing 90.6 % benzyl alcohol conversion and 72.3 % benzaldoxime yield, which is comparable to the best records for electrocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis. The scaled reaction to produce 0.58 g benzaldoxime with a yield of 41 % demonstrates efficient, atom&#8208;economic and step&#8208;economic photocatalytic oxime synthesis via selective C&#8208;N coupling from abundant resources.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Review on Aerogels and Polymeric Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review goes to data&#8208;driven. An exhaustive literature survey provides an overview of research status on aerogels, a category of highly porous solids with unique physicochemical properties. Statistical/data&#8208;driven analysis tells us positive/negative aspects; aerogels have a promising potential to contribute to emerging energy/environmental issues, while they are causing an academic fever with irresponsible exaggerations and a flood of unreliable data.








Abstract
A thoroughly data&#8208;driven review on the chemistry, properties, and applications of aerogels is provided. Aerogel is a category of solid materials having homogeneous, highly porous nanostructures. Unique physicochemical properties of aerogels have attracted much attention in wide fields due to their potentials for energy/environmental issues in the 21st century, while an exponentially increasing number of papers are causing an academic fever and unreliable data issues. Statistical analysis based on an exhaustive literature survey from almost all the papers with &#8220;aerogel&#8221; in their titles reveals a flood of freeze&#8208;dried aerogels mainly consisting of organic polymers and organic&#8211;inorganic composites. Process&#8208;property data from polymer aerogel papers are analyzed by a machine&#8208;learning approach aiming to establish data infrastructure toward future aerogel studies. Data&#8208;evidenced critical discussion specifies a tendency in unreliable thermal conductivity data of these papers.

         <title>Operando Spectroscopic Insights into CO2 Reduction at Electrode/Polyelectrolyte Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrode/polyelectrolyte interface is a notable feature in modern electrochemical technologies that utilize membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. However, its interfacial structure and catalytic behavior remain poorly understood. Here we developed an integrated operando Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) method, to directly investigate the CO2 reduction mechanism at the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface within a practical MEA electrolyzer operating at high current densities. Combined with isotope labeling experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we provide, for the first time, the direct spectroscopic evidence of *CCO, a crucial intermediate for C2 product formation, which has been frequently hypothesized but rarely detected in previous studies. By contrast, the linearly adsorbed *COL intermediate, typically observed in conventional liquid electrolytes, was absent. These distinct behaviors arise from the unique structure of the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface, which shifts the rate&#8208;determining step from the usual C&#8208;C coupling to the *CCO hydrogenation in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. This study not only deepens our understanding of electrode/polyelectrolyte interfacial characteristics, but also offers valuable insights for advancing the performance of CO2 MEA electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atomically Precise Alkynyl&#8208;Functionalized Silver&#8211;Polyoxotungstate Nanocluster with Sandwiched Three&#8208;Layer {Ag13}13+ Cluster Architecture and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of atomically precise, structurally well&#8208;defined polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;stabilized silver clusters with accessible silver surfaces remains a significant challenge. Here, we report an alkynyl&#8208;functionalized silver&#8211;POM hybrid nanocluster, [(n&#8208;Bu)4N]7[(C6H9)6(PW11O39)2Ag13] ((PW11)2&#8208;Ag13), which comprises of a distinctive homovalent three&#8208;layer {Ag13}13+ cluster. This architecture yields a lower HOMO&#8722;LUMO energy gap of 1.93 eV, compared to the precursor [PW11O39]7&#8722; (2.74 eV). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that the lacunary [PW11O39]7&#8208; and alkynyl units direct the formation of the atomically precise {Ag13}13+ cluster, preventing undesirable silver aggregation while maintaining exposed silver surfaces that are crucial for catalytic activity. The synergistic redox capabilities of the POM and silver components enhance the redox reactivity of (PW11)2&#8208;Ag13, promoting efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via a Fenton&#8208;like mechanism. Additionally, biological evaluations further reveal that (PW11)2&#8208;Ag13 exhibits significantly superior antitumor activity than [PW11O39]7&#8722;, primarily through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis facilitated by the active silver cluster sites. These findings highlight the potential of silver cluster&#8208;POM hybrids as promising candidates for anticancer therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Accelerates Electrochemically Driven Single&#8208;Molecule Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular adsorption covers a broad spectrum of chemical processes and device fabrications at solid/liquid interfaces. The unraveling of the underlying mechanisms relies on regulating molecular adsorption. However, achieving such regulation at the single&#8208;molecule level remains a challenge. Herein, we utilized a combined ionic liquid and scanning tunneling microscope break junction methods to tune single 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)aniline molecules gradually from the flat configuration to the upright one and found that only the upright configuration can trigger the oxidative coupling. Experimental and theoretical findings demonstrated that the ionic liquid reduced the electron density of the Au electrode, giving rise to the evolution of the interaction between molecule and electrode from the Au&#8208;&#960; dominated coupling to the Au&#8208;&#963; dominated one. This work will inspire the exploration of strategies that can control the molecular assembly, accelerate the chemical reaction, and promote the fabrication of organic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Potassium&#8208;Bismuth&#8208;Telluride Intermetallic Support Promotes Electrochemical Stability in Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We employed accumulative roll bonding to fabricate self&#8208;standing metallurgical composite of in&#8208;situ formed alkaline potassium&#8208;bismuth&#8208;telluride intermetallic K2(Bi2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) embedded in potassium metal. This newly discovered thermodynamically stable potassiophilic crystal, termed &#8220;KBT&#8221;, is fcc antifluorite with K2Te archetype. Symmetric cells achieve 880 hours of cycling at 0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2. Potassium metal battery (KMB) with Prussian blue (PB) cathode in carbonate electrolyte retains&#160;80% capacity after 200 cycles at 1C. In ether&#8208;based electrolyte with organic cathode, it achieves&#160;80% retention&#160;after 900 cycles at 2C. Combined synchrotron X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;tomography, cryogenic focused ion beam microscopy (Cryo&#8208;FIB)&#160;and sputter&#8208;down X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate uniform electrodeposits, versus baseline of potassium filaments intermixed with pores and coarse SEI. Binary K3Bi&#8208;K and K2Te&#8208;K intermetallic supports also provide improved electrochemical performance, albeit to lesser extent. Multiscale simulation provides&#160;insight into role of support structure in adatom energetics, film nucleation, early&#8208;stage&#160;SEI&#160;morphology and interfacial stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Dual Donor&#8208;Acceptor featured Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled by Gating Effects for Ultra&#8208;Stable Na&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) face severe challenges of uncontrolled sodium dendrite growth and interfacial instability. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a distinct locally polarized covalent organic framework (TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF) was synthesized and employed as a Na+ transport accelerator to promote uniform Na deposition. TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF excited the gating effect (a high gating ratio of 23.1) through electronic response to accomplish the separation of Na+ from the electrolyte solvent via the sodiophilic sites (&#8208;O&#8208;C=C units, C=N linkages, C&#8208;Br bonds, and aromatic rings). Simultaneously, it synergistically induced two electron migration routes based on the dual donor&#8208;acceptor (linkages and linkers) structures, thereby enhancing both electron separation efficiency and Na+ cations&#8217; transport. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of multicomponent sodiophilic sites, the TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF&#8208;based symmetric battery achieved an ultra&#8208;stable operating time of 1000 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 with 1 mAh cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the full battery based on the modified Na@TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF electrode and the carbon&#8208;coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP/C) demonstrated high compatibility and good cycling stability. Theoretical calculation and in situ spectra measurements have jointly proved the molecular stability and mechanical robustness. Therefore, this investigation unveils an unconventional method for creating COF&#8208;based protective layers for the possibly practical of the high&#8208;stability SMBs.</dc:description>

TB-Br-COF excited the gating effect (a high gating ratio of 23.1) through electronic response to accomplish the separation of Na+ from the electrolyte solvent via the sodiophilic sites (-O-C=C units, C=N linkages, C-Br bonds, and aromatic rings). Simultaneously, it synergistically induced two electron migration routes based on the dual donor-acceptor (linkages and linkers) structures, thereby enhancing both electron separation efficiency and Na+ cations&#8217; transport. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of multicomponent sodiophilic sites, the TB-Br-COF-based symmetric battery achieved an ultra-stable operating time of 1000 h at 1 mA cm-2 with 1 mAh cm-2.

         <title>Fast Removing Ligands from Platinum&#8208;Based Nanocatalysts by a Square&#8208;Wave Potential Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing effective methods to remove ligands from the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial for obtaining surface&#8208;cleaned nanocatalysts. In this manuscript, we develop a square&#8208;wave potential (SWP) strategy that efficiently removes ligands from the surface of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based nanocatalysts within 1 minute (40 s), achieving a removal efficiency 30 times higher than that of traditional cyclic voltammetry cycling. Comprehensive analyses of physical characterization and catalytic performance confirm the effectiveness of the SWP strategy. In situ electrochemical infrared and Raman spectroscopy show that the oxidation potential (1.24 V) can replace the Pt&#8208;N coordination bond with a Pt&#8208;O covalent bond to form the intermediate state of Pt&#8208;O&#8208;NH2R during ligand removal, while the reduction potential (0.20 V) can detach the ligand from the surface of Pt. Moreover, the SWP strategy is versatile, extending the efficient removal of various ligands from the surface of Pt and the oleylamine ligand from Pt&#8208;based alloy nanocatalysts. The efficient removal of ligands from nanocatalysts is critical for ensuring the reproducibility of electrocatalytic results and for obtaining clean catalysts to reveal intrinsic effects in nanocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Patch&#8208;Clamp&#8208;like Micropipette Electrode with Exterior and Interior Interfaces for Simultaneous Monitoring of Extracellular and Intracellular Serotonin across Neuron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous monitoring of intracellular and extracellular serotonin (5&#8208;HT) across five orders of magnitude is crucial for understanding 5&#8208;HT&#8208;related diseases. Here we created a patch&#8208;clamp&#8208;like micropipette electrode with double sensing interfaces, in which gold nanoparticles were coated onto exterior surface and conductive hydrogel was in&#8208;situ polymerized by designed macromer to form interior interface. Furthermore, we engineered serotonin binding protein (SerBP) as recognition element to develop open&#8208;circuit potentiometric 5&#8208;HT sensor, and modulated SerBP to enhance dissociation constant towards 5&#8208;HT through key residue mutation to broaden the linear ranges by five orders of magnitude for both intracellular and extracellular 5&#8208;HT recording. Meanwhile, the designed non&#8208;insertion mode together with zero potential detection caused minimal cell damage, thus significantly prolonged the recording duration. Using this powerful tool, we first discovered 5&#8208;HT transporter reversed function to release 5&#8208;HT before intracellular exocytosis enhanced, and together through the release&#8208;reuptake&#8208;metabolism cycle to dynamically regulate the concentration of 5&#8208;HT with the development of seizure.</dc:description>

         <title>From Binary to Higher&#8208;Order Organic Cocrystals: Design Principles and Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cocrystals, particularly the evolution from binary to higher&#8208;order structures, have garnered considerable attention due to their tunable intermolecular interactions and unique material properties. Binary cocrystals, formed through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, charge transfer, and hydrogen/halogen bonding, allow for precise control over molecular packing and enhanced optoelectronic properties. In contrast, higher&#8208;order cocrystals, incorporating three or more components, enable greater complexity and functional diversity. Strategies such as homologation via isostructural substitution, hierarchical intermolecular interactions and Long&#8208;range Synthon Aufbau Modules facilitate the synthesis of these advanced materials. The shift toward higher&#8208;order cocrystals paves the way for novel applications in fields such as deep learning for cocrystal prediction, drug design, organic solar cells, and NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. However, challenges related to molecular screening, ratio optimization, scalable synthesis, and long&#8208;term stability remain critical hurdles for the broader implementation of these materials in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Carbazolyl Cyanobenzene Conjugates: Enabling Biomolecule Functionalization via Photoredox and Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since their discovery in 2012, carbazolyl (iso)phthalonitrile derivatives (Cz(I)PN) have found significant applications as photocatalysts in organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce two efficient methods for incorporating carbazolyl cyanobenzenes into various peptide sequences. The first method involves a photomediated decarboxylative functionalization of the C&#8208;terminus of peptides, leading to the formation of various carbazolyl benzonitrile (CzBN) derivatives. The second method exploits a cysteine&#8208;selective SNAr reaction on a fluorinated arene precursor, resulting in novel peptide&#8208;3CzIPN (Triscarbazolyl&#8208;isophthalonitrile) conjugates. Both types of conjugates maintain delayed fluorescence properties, exhibit similar or wider redox potential, and possess higher excited state energy when compared to currently used cyanoarenes. We demonstrated the photocatalytic activity of these conjugates first through a photo&#8208;mediated peptide C&#8208;terminal decarboxylative alkynylation. Then, water&#8208;soluble peptide conjugates were used to catalyze a thiol&#8208;ene reaction on cysteine in aqueous media. Finally, we achieved protein labeling via aryl azide excitation both in vitro and at the cellular level using peptide&#8208;CzIPN conjugates. By incorporating a peptide ligand of the protein integrin &#945;v&#946;3, proximity&#8208;driven labeling next to this target was realized by aryl azide excitation in living cells, showing an excellent overlap with antibody&#8208;based imaging. These findings reveal the potential of cyanoarene&#8208;peptide conjugates for proximity&#8208;driven photochemistry in a complex biological context.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Stabilization of Pt Single Atoms by Cl and Ru for Industrial&#8208;Scale Current Density Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysts are considered ideal cathodic materials for PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) due to their excellent atom utilization and tunable local coordination environment, yet their durability for practical applications remains unresolved challenge. Herein we report the Pt SAs, synergistically stabilized by Cl&#8208;ligand and Ru nanoparticles, exhibit both high activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction. A key finding is that dynamically evolved Pt&#8208;Cl&#8208;Pt coordination structure protects Pt SAs against aggregation. Theoretical analysis reveals the unique electronic structure of Pt SAs is finely tuned through the synergistic role of Ru and Cl, resulting in a notable stabilization of Pt SAs. PEMWE with such a catalyst at an ultra&#8208;low Pt loading delivers a cell voltage of only 1.66 V at a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8208;2, while maintaining the outstanding electrocatalytic and structural stability of the Pt&#8208;Cl&#8208;Pt coordination over 1000 h, thus providing an application potential of SA catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissected MACl Involved Reaction Pathway for Low Temperature Fabrication of High&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction pathways from lead iodide (PbI2) to intermediate phases (firstly dissected) and subsequent transformation of pure &#945;&#8208;phase perovskite at low annealing temperature have been optimized via a novel methylammonium chloride (MACl) vapor assistance approach. Moreover, temperature&#8208;dependent residual stress and cation reaction competition have been resolved thoroughly. The target flexible perovskite solar cell (f&#8208;PVSC) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.46% (best efficiency at 100 &#176;C) with excellent long&#8208;term and mechanical stabilities.








Abstract
FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are highly promising due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the formation of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 requires annealing at a temperature of at least 150 &#176;C, which can induce significant residual stress and make the process incompatible with plastic substrates, resulting in poor crystal quality and compromised mechanical properties. To address these issues, we present a novel approach using methylammonium chloride (MACl) vapor&#8208;assisted lead iodide (PbI2) to form homogeneous intermediate phases (MAPbCl3 and Pb3I8). This method optimizes the reaction pathway; accordingly pure &#945;&#8208;phase perovskite can be completely formed at 100 &#176;C, contrasting with conventional MACl component engineering in organic amine salt solution. We have intensively deciphered the reaction pathway leading to intermediate phase formation, as well as the nucleation and phase transition processes into the photoactive perovskite at 100 &#176;C. Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive study on temperature&#8208;dependent residual stress and cation reaction competition, meanwhile extensively dissecting the competitive implication of interface mismatch and lattice defects leading to residual stress and cation component inhomogeneity. Consequently, the modified flexible&#8208;PVSCs have achieved a remarkable efficiency of 24.46% (25.50% for rigid PVSCs). The devices also exhibit significantly improved long&#8208;term and mechanical stability.

         <title>NPA6: A Molecule for Non&#8208;Covalently Linked Radical&#8208;Enhanced ISC and High&#8208;Performance Photopolymerization with Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule NPA6 can form light&#8208;induced supramolecular assemblies with radicals, thereby achieving noncovalently linked radical&#8208;enhanced ISC. As a photosensitizer in acrylamide polymerization, it achieves nearly 100% conversion at a concentration of 100&#160;ppm under 410&#160;nm light and ambient conditions. The resulting polymers display room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 0.73&#160;s, making them suitable for in situ defect detection. 








Abstract
To harness electron spin exchange for radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC), a typical strategy involves covalently attaching stable radicals to chromophores. Here, we introduce NPA6, synthesized by attaching heptanamide to N,N&#8208;diphenylnaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;amine (NPA). NPA6 maintains the phosphorescent properties of NPA and exhibits unique photo&#8208;generated radical behavior that is absent in NPA. These radicals can further adsorb neutral molecules to form supramolecular assemblies. Compared to pristine NPA6, these assemblies exhibit nearly complete NMR proton signal suppression in the aromatic region, enhanced absorption near 400&#160;nm, and reduced fluorescence intensity. Phosphorescence measurements at 77&#160;K reveal stronger phosphorescence in the assemblies, with delayed excitation spectra confirming phosphorescence originating exclusively from neutral molecules, indicating successful noncovalent radical&#8208;enhanced ISC. As a photosensitizer in N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide polymerization, NPA6 achieves nearly 100% conversion at 100&#160;ppm under 410&#160;nm light and ambient conditions, exhibiting superior polymerization performance. Additionally, its afterglow makes it suitable as an in situ quality indicator for transparent coatings, suggesting its potential applications in photolithography.

         <title>Contrasting Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts Supported on CeOx Nanoislands with Various Ligand Environments Including Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis from chloride&#8208;containing metal salts gave metal complexes chemisorbed on the supported CeOx nanoislands, having a structure approximated as Pt1Cl2O4. Calcination removed Cl and transformed the adsorbed Pt1Cl2O4 to Pt1O6, embedded within the support and without Cl ligands. Moderate Cl coordinated with Pt exhibits the highest catalytic performance, while excess Cl ligands block the metal sites and inhibit the catalytic activity.








Abstract
Metals that are dispersed atomically on supports offer new and potentially valuable catalytic properties associated with their high atom efficiencies and opportunities for tuning their electronic properties by choice of the support and other ligands bonded to them. Herein, we report the synthesis of atomically dispersed Pt, Rh, and Ir anchored on CeOx nanoislands on a high&#8208;area SiO2 support. Synthesis from chloride&#8208;containing metal salts gave metal complexes chemisorbed on the supported nanoislands, with Pt being prototypical and having a structure approximated as Pt1Cl2O4, as shown by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and calculations at the level of density functional theory (DFT). Calcination converted the adsorbed species into a structure represented as Pt1O6, embedded in the CeOx lattice. The Pt1Cl2O4 was observed to have a higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation than the chloride&#8208;free, embedded Pt1O6 species, and DFT results indicate the role of chloride in enhancing the catalytic activity of the isolated Pt, in contrast to its role as an inhibitor when Pt is present as nanoparticles. This work emphasizes the importance of the first coordination shell in controlling the catalytic properties of atomically dispersed noble metals.

         <title>Inwardly Directed Linker Propagation: Constructing 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with triple entanglement were assembled via inwardly directed linker propagation. The efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production by introducing entanglement in COFs was significantly increased.








Abstract
The limited design strategy of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) greatly restricts their structural diversification and potential applications. Herein, we propose an inwardly directed linker propagation strategy for the targeted assembly of 3D COFs (COF&#8208;IN&#8208;1 and COF&#8208;IN&#8208;2) and compare them with outwardly directed expanded COFs (COF&#8208;OUT&#8208;1 and COF&#8208;OUT&#8208;2). COF&#8208;OUTs exhibit planar heteroporous 2D frameworks with cpt topology, while COF&#8208;INs engineer controlled triple entanglements into networks, forming 3D frameworks with acs topology. Moreover, the COFs assembled via inwardly directed linker propagation effectively enhanced the production of H2O2 photosynthesis. To demonstrate the application potential, a biphasic fluid system was constructed for continuous H2O2 photosynthesis and extraction. This work not only expands the design strategy for achieving 3D COFs but also demonstrates that the dimensional regulation of frameworks and tuning of applications can arise from different expanding directions of the linkers.

         <title>Electrochemical Allene C&#9472;H Functionalization via Carbanion Sampling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy chemistry is pushing the boundaries of synthetic chemistry. Traditionally, the selectivity patterns of C&#9472;H functionalization have been governed by the inherent C&#9472;H bond acidity and strength. Herein, we leverage chromium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen evolution to overcome the intrinsic constraints via carbanion sampling. This strategy enables the unprecedented construction of thermodynamically unfavored products, including alkylated allenes and alkynes. 








Abstract
Functionalization of C&#9472;H bonds represents a direct and practical avenue to upgrade simple organic molecules to value&#8208;added products, whereas the reaction selectivity is largely governed by the acidity and bond dissociation energy (BDE) of C&#9472;H bonds. Developing a novel strategy to break these constraints is highly desirable, as it would open a new horizon for conventionally challenging molecules.

     alt="Electrochemical Allene C&#9472;H Functionalization via Carbanion Sampling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy chemistry is pushing the boundaries of synthetic chemistry. Traditionally, the selectivity patterns of C&#9472;H functionalization have been governed by the inherent C&#9472;H bond acidity and strength. Herein, we leverage chromium-catalyzed hydrogen evolution to overcome the intrinsic constraints via carbanion sampling. This strategy enables the unprecedented construction of thermodynamically unfavored products, including alkylated allenes and alkynes. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionalization of C&#9472;H bonds represents a direct and practical avenue to upgrade simple organic molecules to value-added products, whereas the reaction selectivity is largely governed by the acidity and bond dissociation energy (BDE) of C&#9472;H bonds. Developing a novel strategy to break these constraints is highly desirable, as it would open a new horizon for conventionally challenging molecules. Herein, we disclosed a carbanion sampling strategy that enables unconventional selectivity in the allene C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H functionalization harnessing chromium-catalyzed hydrogen evolution. The electrochemical protocol provides in situ access to diverse allene carbanions and facilitates a dynamic carbanion sampling process to give thermodynamically unfavored products. 1,3-Disubstituted allenes were precisely functionalized at the less acidic and stronger C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H site to yield abnormal site-selective allene products, while the 1,1-substituted allenes proceeded isomerization to deliver functionalized alkynes. All of the products presented in this work are unprecedented and exhibit remarkable versatility in late-stage derivatization. The superiority of the carbanion sampling strategy was demonstrated in the convergent synthesis of functionalized allenes from alkyne or mixed substrates. More importantly, we conducted a series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments to rationalize the unconventional selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energetics Modulation for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mobile ions in perovskite films would trigger ion migration and self&#8208;accelerating chemical degradation. Here we propose an energetics modulation strategy by developing the electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinecarboxaldehyde oxime to modulate the ionization energy and energy level structure of perovskite, inhibiting the generation of mobile ions. The optimized devices demonstrate enhanced efficiency of 26.13% with an operating lifetime of T88&#160;=&#160;1000 h.








Abstract
The operational stability of n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under heat, air, and humidity has notably improved over recent years. Yet, performance degradation under light and voltage bias remains a concern for their commercial deployment. One of the main causes of such degradation relates to mobile ions in the perovskite film, which can trigger ion migration and self&#8208;accelerating chemical degradation. Here, we propose an energetics modulation strategy by developing the electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinecarboxaldehyde oxime (PO) ligand for FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The introduction of PO ligands increases the ionization potential of the perovskite, inhibiting the generation of mobile ions during the crystallization process and subsequent device operation. Furthermore, this additive promotes the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts, which can help to regulate the energy level of perovskite and facilitate charge transport to the contact stacks. As a result, the optimized n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs exhibit a high efficiency of 26.13% and maintain over 88% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h maximum power point (MPP) tracking test under 1 sun illumination. This work underlines the importance of energetics modulation for inhibiting intrinsic perovskite degradation that cannot be achieved by mere device encapsulation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Singlet Oxygen Production in a Cascade Photoelectrocatalytic System for Water Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interaction between the photoanodic and cathodic reactions to boost the singlet oxygen production without addition of chemical precursors, which circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable process and fundamentally changes the traditional singlet oxygen generation pathway, thereby promising a green, low&#8208;consumption, and sustainable approach to water decontamination. 








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) demonstrates great potential for selective wastewater detoxification, which raises the appeal to achieve a controllable, mild, and efficient generation of this reactive species for water decontamination. Herein, we present a novel cascade photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system operated via the interaction between the photoanodic and cathodic reactions without the addition of chemical precursors, realizing highly efficient &#185;O&#8322; production (79.7&#160;&#181;mol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1) and low energy consumption (0.052&#160;kWh m&#8722;3 &#8208;log) for antibiotic degradation. The enhanced 1O2 production is proven to benefit from the synergistic effect of multiple activation pathways under PEC excitation. With the combined action of both the built&#8208;in electric field and external electric field, the holes in the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photoanode are maximally retained, and electrons are transferred to cathode to undergo the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the production of the crucial reactive oxygen species as intermediates. The occurrence of a cascade reaction is initiated by electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; ORR on the cathode and terminated by superoxide species oxidation by holes on the photoanode. The hole&#8208;involved 1O2 generation pathway circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable process of traditional 1O2 generation. This work highlights a new PEC route for highly efficient 1O2 generation, making it a potential application in more effective environmental remediation.

         <title>Steric&#8208;Dominated Intermediate Stabilization by Organic Cations Enables Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an organic cation engineering strategy utilizing steric hindrance effects to regulate intermediate adsorption during CO2 electroreduction. The elongation of alkyl chains facilitates K+ displacement while enhancing organic cation adsorption on copper surfaces. These synergistic effects strengthen crucial intermediate binding, thereby improving formic acid selectivity.








Abstract
Precisely modulating the binding energies of intermediates through cationic engineering remains a pivotal challenge in controlling reaction pathways and improving selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Although alkali cations are widely recognized as stabilizing intermediates via electrostatic interactions, this study proposes a steric&#8208;effect&#8208;dominated strategy using organic quaternary ammonium cations (CnTA+) to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates. Through in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), we elucidate that CnTA+ cations with longer alkyl chains substitute K+ more efficiently within the electrical double layer, exhibiting higher affinity for the Cu surface. This steric dominance significantly enhances the adsorption of key intermediates, steering the pathway toward formic acid (HCOOH) production. An improved Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 90% for HCOOH was achieved using octadecyl trimethyl ammonium (C18TA+) cations. This molecular engineering strategy provides a route to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates to improve the performance of CO2RR.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Dynamics of Cholesteric Polymer Coatings via Hydrazone Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present an innovative approach, which integrates responsive molecules into larger ensembles, resulting in photo&#8208;controllable and photo&#8208;patternable colors. By covalently coupling hydrazone photoswitches with supramolecular helical polymer networks, we harness light&#8208;driven molecular shape changes to modulate structural color. Our multilength scale design enables macroscopic level function and potential applications in tunable photonics and optics. 








Abstract
Developing responsive coatings and materials requires discovering a breadth of mechanisms by which external stimuli can be converted into useful signals. Here, we demonstrate an approach driven by supramolecular mechanochemistry, where mechanical input&#8212;molecular shape change&#8212;is translated into structural color variation. By embedding bistable, negatively photochromic hydrazone photoswitches into cholesteric polymer networks, we achieve a reversible, stable color shift through molecular&#8208;scale pulling and pushing of the photonic scaffold. Unlike azobenzene&#8208;based systems, which typically disrupt liquid crystal order, this approach modifies the pitch of a cross&#8208;linked cholesteric helix without disrupting the organisation of the material. The long&#8208;lived stability of both hydrazone isomers ensures durable optical switching. This effect provides a new strategy for designing mechanoresponsive photonic coatings and tunable optical materials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;tuned Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition of Azo&#8208;grafted Poly(thioctic acid) with Ultrahigh Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional materials with photo&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition have garnered significant attention and found extensive applications across cutting&#8208;edge domains. However, previous photo&#8208;liquefiable behaviors of azopolymers are usually induced through UV light, which may damage the performances of the materials and is also harmful to human health. Here, a novel azopolymer (Azo&#8208;PTA) was fabricated via the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of thioctic acid (TA) and azobenzene&#8208;modified thioctic acid (Azo&#8208;TA). Interestingly, Azo&#8208;PTA could undergo a reversible solid&#8208;liquid transition under green light irradiation. The phase transition process of Azo&#8208;PTA was investigated systematically through various experimental and measurement methods. The results demonstrated that the solid&#8208;liquid transition of Azo&#8208;PTA was ascribed to the photothermal effect rather than the photochemical process. The light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency of Azo&#8208;PTA was as high as 84.9%, and the temperature could increase to above 90 &#176;C within 30 s of green light irradiation. Consequently, azopolymers with green light&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition behaviors were successfully achieved. Moreover, several cutting&#8208;edge applications of Azo&#8208;PTA were explored, including photo&#8208;switchable adhesion, self&#8208;healing coating and smart window. Our finding thus opens up a new platform for the fabrication of azopolymers with visible light&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional materials with photo-regulated solid-liquid transition have garnered significant attention and found extensive applications across cutting-edge domains. However, previous photo-liquefiable behaviors of azopolymers are usually induced through UV light, which may damage the performances of the materials and is also harmful to human health. Here, a novel azopolymer (Azo-PTA) was fabricated via the ring-opening copolymerization of thioctic acid (TA) and azobenzene-modified thioctic acid (Azo-TA). Interestingly, Azo-PTA could undergo a reversible solid-liquid transition under green light irradiation. The phase transition process of Azo-PTA was investigated systematically through various experimental and measurement methods. The results demonstrated that the solid-liquid transition of Azo-PTA was ascribed to the photothermal effect rather than the photochemical process. The light-to-heat conversion efficiency of Azo-PTA was as high as 84.9%, and the temperature could increase to above 90 &#176;C within 30 s of green light irradiation. Consequently, azopolymers with green light-regulated solid-liquid transition behaviors were successfully achieved.

         <title>Enhanced Cycling Performance of Li&#8208;rich Oxide Cathode via a Vaccine Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;component incorporation and its inoculated gradient disorder structure can greatly modify the properties of materials. However, the contribution of the inoculated surface gradient disorder structure on the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with distinctive intergraded structure of LiMO2 (M=Ni, Mn, Co) and Li2MnO3 has been overlooked. Here, we reveal a vaccine effect of surface gradient disorder structure, demonstrating its significant improvement on the cycling performance of inoculated Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2. The inoculated Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 exhibits &#160;an initial coulombic efficiency of 85% and maintains ultra&#8208;high stability with 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Furthermore, it deliveres a capacity of 154.5 mAh g&#8208;1 with 84.2% retention after 900 cycles at current density of 200 mA g&#8208;1. Through a combination of electrochemical analysis and theoretical simulations via the basic Nernst equations, we demonstrate that the inoculated gradient disorder structure changes the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the lattice oxygen redox process, which follows three sequential steps O2&#8208;&#8594;O22&#8208;&#8594;O2&#8208;&#8594;O2. This structural modification reconstructs the lattice oxygen redox, specially enhancing the electrode potential of the O2&#8208;&#8594;O2 step and reducing the reaction rate of O2&#8208;&#8594;O22&#8208;&#8594;O2&#8208; of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2. These findings bring a novel perspective on the conventional foreign element incorporation strategy, providing valuable insights to support the continued development of Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation for the Construction of Fluoro&#8208;, Chloro&#8208;, and Trifluoromethyl Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic compounds containing a chiral, halogenated aliphatic carbon center are useful in medicinal chemistry, but their enantioselective synthesis remains difficult. Here we develop a general approach to access these compounds through cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of allenes and alkenes with dihaloamides. The reactions of allenes and terminal alkenes lead to alkylation only at the terminal position. In contrast, the reactions of internal alkenes occur via chain&#8208;walking and alkylation at the terminal position. These reactions operate by enantioconvergent transformation of racemic secondary alkyl halides to give enantio&#8208;enriched products. The method exhibits broad scope and high chemo, regio, and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated by further transformations of the products as well as the application in late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells via Chloramine Hydrochloride Molecular Bridges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require synergistic passivation strategies to address defects at the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface, impacting both efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. This study introduces chloramine hydrochlorides (CAHs) &#8211; 2&#8208;Chloroethylamine Hydrochloride (CEA), Bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)amine Hydrochloride (BCEA), and Tris(2&#8208;Chloroethyl)Amine Hydrochloride (TCEA) &#8211; as bifunctional molecular bridges to simultaneously passivate defects at both ETL (SnO2) and perovskite interfaces while controlling crystallization. Density functional theory calculations showed that TCEA forms strong Sn&#8208;Cl bonds, enhancing Sn4+ coordination. In situ characterization revealed that TCEA accelerated perovskite formation, suppressed PbI2, and promoted larger grains, thus minimizing grain boundary defects. This leads to an improved electron extraction efficiency, prolonged hot&#8208;carrier cooling, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.25% (compared to 23.64% for controls), with negligible hysteresis and 90% PCE retention after 1000 h under ambient conditions. This study establishes a universal molecular design strategy for dual&#8208;interface engineering in high&#8208;efficiency and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Modulation and Active Site Exposure Using C60 Fullerenolamine Enable High&#8208;Performance Alcohol Oxidation on Pd Metallene Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The availability of active sites and the electronic structure of metal heterogeneous catalysts are crucial to maximize their catalytic performance. In this study, we describe a new and efficient catalyst system, C60 fullerenolamine (FA)&#8208;modified Pd metallene (Pdene), and demonstrate that the FA molecules not only increase the active sites availability but also exert an electronic effect that enhances the catalytic performance of Pdene in alcohol oxidation reactions. Specifically, FA increases the electrochemical active surface area through dispersion, while its electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics induce an electron&#8208;deficient surface on Pdene, which facilitates the adsorption of electron&#8208;rich intermediates (OH*) and the desorption of electron&#8208;deficient poisonous intermediates (CO*). The practical significance of this modification is demonstrated by achieving a 54.5% increase in mass activity and 46.3% enhancement in specific activity for ethanol oxidation relative to Pdene. Beyond these improvements, the FA&#8208;Pdene catalyst demonstrates exceptional operational stability, superior CO poisoning resistance, and enhanced C1 pathway selectivity. An in&#8208;depth analysis utilizing in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory calculations, offers valuable insights into how the FA ligand modulates the mechanistic pathways involved in ethanol oxidation processes. This fullerene&#8208;mediated catalytic effect could hold the key to unlocking the potential of the metal&#8208;based system.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Meltable MOF to Tune Liquid Transition and Promote Coenzyme Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the liquid phase of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) presents new opportunities for functionalizing glassy MOFs, expanding the fundamental science and practical application for this emerging family of materials. Herein, we report the fabrication of a bimetallic glassy MOF via a liquid&#8208;liquid transition process. This is achieved by introducing a robust Schiff base&#8208;cobalt functional group into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62, which attracts negatively charged imidazolate ligands, facilitating low&#8208;temperature melting. This ultimately leads to the formation of a bimetallic glassy MOF (Co/Zn&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62&#8208;ipy) upon melt&#8208;quenching. The material features an exceptionally high glass&#8208;forming capability, uniformly distributed bimetallic ions, and a markedly enhanced visible light photogeneration efficiency of enzymatically active nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) when compared with Co&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;62 glass. These findings offer novel insights into modulating the liquid phase of a MOF to develop functional glassy MOF photocatalysts for coenzyme NADH regeneration and other advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Mechanisms Behind Structural Repair of Spent Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural repair is a vital step in the direct recycling of spent LiNixCoyMnzO2 lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently clear. Herein, the thermal solid&#8208;state structural repair of spent LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) layered cathode material is systematically investigated. Through multiscale techniques combining XRD, XAS and 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR, we identify the structural degradation in spent NCM622 and monitor both, long&#8208; and short&#8208;range structural evolution during repair. Our findings reveal that degradation predominantly occurs through Ni migration into Li octahedral sites, while Co and Mn demonstrate relatively lower occupancies in the Li layer. Such occupancies are primarily responsible for structural disorder and cubic&#8208;symmetry domain formation within the spent material. The repair process is demonstrated to involve re&#8208;lithiation, oxygen capture, increased transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxidation states, and the migration of TM ions from the Li layer back to the TM layer, followed by cation diffusion. Both temperature and lithium compensation ratio are identified as critical factors promoting these processes. Capacity recovery studies show a strong correlation between reduced TM occupancy in the Li layer and improved electrochemical performances. These insights allow us to move beyond conventional phase&#8208;transition perspectives, offering an atomic&#8208;level understanding of structural degradation and repair mechanisms in spent layered cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia using Bimetallic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tandem Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to simultaneously realize pollutant removal and ammonia generation. However, this process involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons along with multiple by&#8208;products, resulting in a significant challenge for achieving high ammonia yield and selectivity. Herein, we introduced bimetallic covalent organic frameworks catalysts with Cu and Co active sites to achieve a two&#8208;step tandem reaction, avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling an efficient NO3RR. For the initial two&#8208;electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate, promoting their conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen and stabilize the subsequent six&#8208;electron process, thereby improving the overall reaction efficiency. Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency (NH3 yield rate = 20.8 mg&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2, FE = 92.16% in 0.3 M nitrate). Such coordinated two&#8208;step process advances the efficiency and applicability of NO3RR through optimizing a cascade catalytic reaction, thereby establishing an innovative path for the engineering of NO3RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Bifunctional N&#8208;Benzoyloxyamides for Photoredox Amidative Dual Functionalizations of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present a photocatalytic strategy for the intermolecular dual functionalizations of alkenes using N&#8211;O bifunctional reagents in an atom&#8208;economical fashion. By leveraging N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides as bifunctional precursors for generating both amidyl radical and internal O&#8208;nucleophiles, this approach achieves chemoselective olefin amidation with simultaneous incorporation of additional functional groups. The current method readily accesses a range of doubly functionalized amino products through 1,2&#8208;amidooxygenation, amidoazidation, and formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation. Mechanistic studies revealed that the selective interplay of radical and ionic pathways is operative to enable a unified platform for this olefin dual functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;Embedded 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Quasi&#8208;Honeycomb Lattice for High&#8208;Capacitance Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;OHDDQP 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) was synthesized possessing a unique quasi&#8208;honeycomb topology, from a pyrazine&#8208;fused, D2&#8208;symmetric ligand. The achieved 2D c&#8208;MOF electrode displayed a remarkable gravimetric capacitance up to 452 A g&#8722;1 for electrochemical lithium storage. Supported by theory and the spectroscopic experiments, the role of the backbone&#8208;embedded pyrazine moieties is unveiled, showing they can offer extra sites for both lithium adsorption and pseudocapacitive charge storage.








Abstract
As a unique class of framework electronic materials, 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) exhibit intrinsic porosity, superior electrical conductivity, and abundant active sites. These properties endow them with great potential in electrochemical lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the development of 2D c&#8208;MOF&#8208;based capacitors has encountered a bottleneck in enhancing Li&#8208;ion storage capacitance, and the design of high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrode materials has remained a challenge. Herein, we synthesize a Cu&#8208;OHDDQP (octahydroxy&#8208;dibenzo[a,c]dibenzo[5,6:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]phenazine) 2D c&#8208;MOF with a quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice by employing a nonplanar D2&#8208;symmetric conjugated ligand embedding redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties. The quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice features a dual&#8208;porous tessellation of C6&#8208;symmetric and C3&#8208;symmetric pores. Notably, when utilized as active material for electrochemical lithium storage, Cu&#8208;OHDDQP achieves a record&#8208;high gravimetric specific capacitance among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs of 452 F g&#8722;1 in aqueous lithium electrolyte,&#160;along with a decent cycling stability of 90% after 1000 cycles. Such high capacitance is attributed to both the quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice leading to higher surface area and the redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties offering extra lithium&#8208;adsorption sites and associated pseudocapacitance. This work demonstrates that rational ligand design enables high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrodes materials, highlighting the potential of conductive MOFs for electrochemical energy technologies.

         <title>Electronically Asynchronous Transition State Tuned from Remote Site for Oxygen Atom Transfer by CuII&#8211;Nitrite Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of electronically asynchronous transition state in oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reaction by CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722; complexes (1&#8722;4) controlled from remote site. OAT reactivity was found to be linearly correlated with &#160;&#946;&#8208;LUMO and Cu(II)/(I) redox potentials, which were tuned from remote site substituents. Mechanistic study indicates asynchronous electron transfer mechanism where CuII/I reduction precedes nitrite reduction. 








Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) reduction to nitric oxide (NO) is of paramount interest in biology. In biology, Cu&#8211;nitrite reductase reduces NO2&#8722;&#160;to NO, while alternatively NO2&#8722;&#160;can be reduced to NO at copper center via oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to electron&#8208;rich substrate like PPh3. This work demonstrates systematic tuning of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy by remote site modification, which leads to systematic change in electrochemical property and OAT activity of CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722;&#160;involving electronically asynchronous transition state. For this purpose, we report here four CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722; complexes: [CuII(LCH2)(NO2)(ClO4)] (1), [CuII(LO)(NO2)(ClO4)] (2), [CuII(LCH2Me)(NO2)(ClO4)] (3), [CuII(LOMe)(NO2)(ClO4)] (4) with similar primary coordination spheres but different substituents at remote sites. In going from 1 to 4, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy, which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh3 resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for 4 compared to 1. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism that was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from 1 to 4 is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states, which was controlled from remote site modification.

In going from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy, which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; compared to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism that was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states, which was controlled from remote site modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Chirality Inversion in Propeller&#8208;Shaped PDI Oligomers with Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent propeller&#8208;shaped PDI hexamer exhibiting solvent&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) was synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction. The propeller chirality undergoes reversible inversion, enabling discrimination between mixtures of CH2Cl2 and CHCl3.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has the potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications. One of the major challenges in this field is the development of CPL emitters, whose emission properties can be modulated by external stimuli, such as solvents. However, CPL&#8208;active materials are often synthetically demanding and typically require chiral separation. To address these limitations, we have synthesized a propeller&#8208;shaped molecule, (R/S)&#8208;Bz&#8208;6PDI 1, via a one&#8208;pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, using a chiral pyrrole&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) 4 as the blade. The introduction of a chiral auxiliary into the blade enabled the induction of propeller chirality without the need for chiral chromatographic separation. (R)&#8208;Bz&#8208;6PDI 1 exhibited high CPL brightness in solution (BCPL&#160;=&#160;103&#8211;369&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1). Furthermore, the propeller chirality proved highly sensitive to the solvent environment, leading to significant modulation of both the sign and intensity of the CD and CPL signals, including complete signal inversion in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. CD spectral analysis combined with DFT calculations revealed that the propeller chirality is governed by the orientation of the hydrogen atom in the chiral auxiliary.

         <title>Functional SELEX and Biomedical Applications of Aptamers: Beyond Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the limitations of traditional aptamer selection methods, which often ignore functional performance in biological contexts. Functional SELEX now selects aptamers with both high specificity and biological activity (F&#8208;aptamers), making them valuable for therapy and cellular regulation. This minireview further highlights advances, challenges, and opportunities in F&#8208;aptamer research, emphasizing the transformative potential of F&#8208;aptamers in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers, developed through SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), are generally short oligonucleotide molecules with remarkable specificity and binding affinity to diverse biological targets. These molecules have shown promise across such fields as biosensing, molecular diagnostics, and bioimaging. However, while conventional aptamer selection strategies predominantly emphasize binding affinity, they overlook the broader spectrum of potential biological functionalities. This oversight results in aptamers that frequently exhibit limited capacity for direct biological regulation. This inherent limitation in the selection process significantly constrains both the widespread application of aptamers across diverse fields and their therapeutic potential as direct drug candidates. Functional SELEX represents an advancement by refining selection library construction and selection processes to create F&#8208;aptamers that integrate precise molecular recognition with specific biological activities. F&#8208;aptamers hold transformative potential as therapeutic agents, diagnostic tools, and molecular regulators, marking a significant step forward in biomedical applications. This minireview critically assesses recent developments in F&#8208;aptamer SELEX strategies, addressing challenges, and exploring opportunities for future research in this dynamic field.

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Bilateral Functions Enable Working Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries at &#8722;60&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboxylate&#8208;based electrolyte featuring solvent&#8208;anion synergism and self&#8208;purification can accelerate interfacial kinetics, stabilize interphases, and enable sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) to operate reliably at &#8722;60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Sluggish interfacial reaction kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases seriously hinder the practical applications of sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with extremely low&#8208;temperature performance. Here, we propose an ester&#8208;based electrolyte featuring solvent&#8208;anion synergistic and self&#8208;purification functions that empowers SMBs to operate stably at record&#8208;low temperatures down to &#8722;60 &#176;C. The weakly solvating fluorinated solvent (ethyl difluoroacetate, [EDFA]) constructs an anion&#8208;dominated solvated structure, where the high&#8208;donor&#8208;number trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) synergistically reduces the Na+ desolvation energy barrier while triggering the defluorination of EDFA. This dynamic process in situ generates inorganic components (e.g., NaF) in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Further, tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite (TMSPi) additive effectively scavenges corrosive HF species through a self&#8208;purification mechanism, ensuring durable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. As a result, the ester&#8208;based SMBs render a capacity retention of 96% at &#8722;40 &#176;C (relative to the room&#8208;temperature capacity), exceptional rate capacity (81.64 mAh g&#8722;1 at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with 70.26% retention at &#8722;40 &#176;C, which is the best rate capability at extremely low temperature compared to other ester&#8208;based SMBs), and extended cycle ability (&gt;300 cycles at &#8722;40 &#176;C and 100 cycles at &#8722;60 &#176;C). This work establishes a new paradigm for developing ester&#8208;based electrolytes to address the extreme&#8208;temperature operation challenges of SMBs.

         <title>Evidence for Methylaluminoxane (MAO) Molecular Structure and Reactivity from Ultrahigh Magnetic Field 27Al MAS NMR Spectroscopy Combined with DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structure of olefin polymerization activator methylaluminoxane (MAO) was probed using ultrahigh field solid&#8208;state NMR backed with DFT calculations, revealing its key motifs and reactive centers.









Abstract
The structure and reactivity of methylaluminoxane (MAO), a reagent of major interest for olefin polymerization, both industrially and academically, has been probed using ultrahigh magnetic field solid&#8208;state NMR (28.2 T, 1200 MHz for 1H Larmor frequency). High resolution methods combined with density functional calculations allowed for the identification and quantification of five major aluminum sites, providing precise information on the structure of MAO at the molecular level. Based on reactivity studies with THF and [ZrCp2Me2], the main reactive centers are identified as bismethyl aluminum species stabilized via a bridging methyl group from a neighboring Al center, featuring both high chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constants (162 ppm and 27.4 MHz, respectively). This approach demonstrates the ability to monitor the chemistry of MAO with unprecedented precision, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of its structure and reactivity.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;X and C&#9472;H Borylation of Aryl Halides for the Synthesis of Bis(boronate)benzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a general and cost&#8208;efficient route for accessing bis&#8208;borylated arenes from structure&#8208;diverse and readily available aryl halides via simultaneous C&#9472;X and C&#9472;H borylation using a titanium catalyst. Mechanistic and DFT studies revealed an unprecedented reaction mechanism driven by aryl radical, generated from the aryl halides' interaction with in situ formed Cp2Ti(II) and tBuOLi.

Despite the intensive studies on the synthesis and application of aryl boronates, most focus on mono&#8208;borylated arenes. The multi&#8208;borylated arenes, on the other hand, have received much less attention because the preparation of multi&#8208;borylated arenes in a straightforward manner is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present our findings on synthesizing bis&#8208;borylated arenes from structure&#8208;diverse and readily available aryl halides (Ar&#9472;X, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Simultaneous C&#9472;X and C&#9472;H borylation of aryl halides is achieved using earth&#8208;abundant titanium as a catalyst. Not only the 1,2&#8208;bis borylation but also the 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;bis borylation are achieved. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations propose a titanium&#8208;mediated aryl radical&#8208;driven reaction resulting in selective bis&#8208;borylation over mono&#8208;borylation.

&lt;p&gt;This work provides a general and cost-efficient route for accessing bis-borylated arenes from structure-diverse and readily available aryl halides via simultaneous C&#9472;X and C&#9472;H borylation using a titanium catalyst.

         <title>Kinetically Enhanced Access to a Dynamic Polyester Platform via Sequence Selective Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulphur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare sequence&#8208;selective terpolymerisation of elemental sulphur, aromatic thioanhydrides, and epoxides yields dynamic poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx) polymers. Mechanistic insights reveal a lithium&#8208;catalysed rate enhancement via ester coordination. The resulting polymers are thermally stable, backbone&#8208;editable, and processable into degradable adhesives.








Abstract
Elemental sulphur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, contains preformed dynamic sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds promising to impart dynamicity onto polymers obtained from this monomer. Yet robust methodologies to access linear polymers with tuneable properties and functionality are rare. Addressing these problems, we here report a rare sequence selective terpolymerisation of elemental sulphur with aromatic thioanhydrides and epoxides under simple lithium alkoxide catalysis yields semi&#8208;aromatic poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx). This enables access to terpolymers from a greatly improved range of epoxide comonomers compared to previous methodologies, including industrially relevant, flexible, rigid, functional and natural product&#8208;derived variants, allowing tuning of glass transition temperatures across a Tg range of&#160;&gt;150 &#176;C. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the insertion of S8 leads to an unusual rate acceleration via coordinative participation of the polyester links sitting adjacent to the propagating chain end. The thermal stability of the polymers allows for post polymerisation backbone modification via &#9472;S&#9472;S&#9472; bond metathesis. After crosslinking, these can be applied as thermally reprocessable and acid degradable adhesives. Our contribution paves the way for the rational buildup of diverse and functional polymer structures from elemental sulphur waste.

         <title>Photoexcited Hole&#8208;Enabled Synthesis of Surface High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Oxo Species with Water as the Oxygen Atom Source for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis of CoIV&#9552;O with H2O as the oxygen atom source under visible light irradiation. The photoexcited holes accelerate water photolysis to form cobalt&#8208;coordinated hydroxyls that then undergo deprotonation to form CoIV&#9552;O. This process is not dependent on the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) between chlorite and low&#8208;valent cobalt, challenging the traditional notion that oxidants are the sole oxygen atom donors for high&#8208;valent metal species.








Abstract
High&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo species (CoIV&#9552;O) are key intermediates in catalytic chemistry but suffer a great challenge in their efficient and mild synthesis due to the strong electronic repulsion between the cobalt center and the oxygen ligand. Herein, we report a new approach to synthesizing surface CoIV&#9552;O on the Co3O4/BiVO4 (CoBi) catalyst via a photoexcited hole&#8208;induced process using water as the oxygen atom source. The interfacial Co2+&#9472;O&#9472;Bi3+ bonds act as the atomic&#8208;level channels to directionally transport photoexcited holes driven by the internal electric field effect. It has been found that H2O was photolyzed to cobalt&#8208;coordinated hydroxyls that were turned to CoIV&#9552;O via a photoexcited hole&#8208;induced deprotonation. The isotopic labeling experiments confirmed that the oxygen atom source of CoIV&#9552;O was derived from water rather than chlorite. A synergistic effect was formed between photocatalysis and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed chlorite activation, which enhanced the degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and elevated the conversion ratio of chlorite to chlorine dioxide (ClO2) from 40% to 60%. The present work has elucidated the essential role of H2O and photoexcited holes in the formation of CoIV&#9552;O and provides a viable strategy to synthesize surface high&#8208;valent metal species utilizing ubiquitous water and sunlight for water purification.

         <dc:description>Lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction can overcome the scaling relations&#8208;induced limitations imposed by conventional adsorption evolution mechanism, but faces challenges in maximizing activation of lattice oxygen species. The flexible structure of three&#8208;phase heterostructured catalysts provides the possibility for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis, yet still face the bottleneck of synthesis difficulty and insufficient regulation. Herein, a facile quenching route is proposed for the synthesis of core&#8208;shell catalysts, and the influence mechanism of three&#8208;phase heterostructure on quenching engineering is elucidated. High&#8208;temperature LaNiO3 nanoparticles are quenched in FeSO4 solution to construct a LaNiO3/Fe(OH)3 core&#8208;shell structure by inducing rapid hydrolysis of Fe2+. The differential thermal expansion coefficient between LaNiO3 and Fe2O3, as well as the three&#8208;phase interfaces composed of core&#8208;shell structure and amorphous/crystalline phases in Fe2O3 shell, result in significant surface/interface regulation for LaNiO3/Fe2O3 core&#8208;shell catalysts during re&#8208;quenching in Co(NO3)2 solution, including richer lattice distortion and defects, and more heteroatom doping. The derived three&#8208;phase heterostructured catalysts exhibit significantly improved oxygen electrocatalytic activity with lattice oxygen participation, and the assembled liquid zinc&#8208;air batteries show excellent output power density and cycling performance.

         <dc:description>Red&#8208;emissive organic materials play a pivotal role in optoelectronics, including displays, optical communications, organic lasers, and biomedicine, owing to their high penetration and low scattering properties. However, conventional polymer and thin&#8208;film emitters often face efficiency losses at long wavelengths and limited operational stability. Organic molecular crystals have emerged as promising alternatives by offering high purity, low defect density, and unique optical anisotropy. Among them, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals (ROMCs) remain relatively underdeveloped compared to their blue and green counterparts. Moreover, the inherent brittleness of most crystals poses significant challenges for their integration into flexible and wearable devices. This review highlights recent advances in the design and development of &#160;ROMCs, emphasizing molecular and crystal engineering strategies to overcome photophysical limitations and impart mechanical flexibility. Emerging applications in organic lasers, optical waveguides, and bioimaging are discussed, alongside key challenges and future research directions. By bridging fundamental understanding and practical deployment, this perspective offers a comprehensive roadmap for the rational design of flexible, red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting crystalline materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Maximizing Accessible Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Sites on Highly Curved Surfaces via Chemical Vapor Deposition for Boosting Multienzyme&#8208;like Activities of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) have emerged as a highly promising class of next&#8208;generation nanozymes. However, their widespread application remains significantly restricted by low reaction activity, primarily attributed to inefficient site utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we provided a novel approach to maximize accessible Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites on a highly curved surface&#160;through chemical vapor deposition. This innovative catalyst demonstrated superior multienzyme&#8208;like activities compared to the conventional single iron atom catalyst (FeSA) with planar Fe&#8208;N4 sites. Specifically, for peroxidase&#8208;like activity, the hFeSA exhibited a maximal reaction velocity of 1.91&#215;10&#8208;7 M s&#8208;1, a catalytic constant of 5.78 s&#8208;1, and a specific activity of 177.5 U/mg, which were 9.67&#8208;fold, 2.56&#8208;fold, and 9.56&#8208;fold higher than those of the conventional FeSA, respectively. Similarly, for oxidase&#8208;like activity, the hFeSA achieved a maximal reaction velocity of 2.84&#215;10&#8208;7 M s&#8208;1, a catalytic constant of 4.3 s&#8208;1, and a specific activity of 76.27 U/mg, representing enhancements of 11.18&#8208;fold, 2.97&#8208;fold, and 12.01&#8208;fold over FeSA, respectively. These results underscore the significant advantages of hFeSA in dramatically enhancing multienzyme&#8208;like activities. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that single iron atoms anchored on curved surfaces can effectively lower the energy barrier, thereby enhancing the intrinsic activity of the Fe&#8208;N4 sites and accelerating reaction kinetics.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) have emerged as a highly promising class of next-generation nanozymes. However, their widespread application remains significantly restricted by low reaction activity, primarily attributed to inefficient site utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we provided a novel approach to maximize accessible Fe-N-C sites on a highly curved surface&#160;through chemical vapor deposition. This innovative catalyst demonstrated superior multienzyme-like activities compared to the conventional single iron atom catalyst (FeSA) with planar Fe-N4 sites. Specifically, for peroxidase-like activity, the hFeSA exhibited a maximal reaction velocity of 1.91&#215;10-7 M s-1, a catalytic constant of 5.78 s-1, and a specific activity of 177.5 U/mg, which were 9.67-fold, 2.56-fold, and 9.56-fold higher than those of the conventional FeSA, respectively. Similarly, for oxidase-like activity, the hFeSA achieved a maximal reaction velocity of 2.84&#215;10-7 M s-1, a catalytic constant of 4.3 s-1, and a specific activity of 76.27 U/mg, representing enhancements of 11.18-fold, 2.97-fold, and 12.01-fold over FeSA, respectively. These results underscore the significant advantages of hFeSA in dramatically enhancing multienzyme-like activities. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that single iron atoms anchored on curved surfaces can effectively lower the energy barrier, thereby enhancing the intrinsic activity of the Fe-N4 sites and accelerating reaction kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Engineered Multivalent TMV Nanodisk Platform for Modulating Integrin Clustering and Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clustering of cell&#8208;surface receptors is essential for initiating signaling cascades and regulating cellular functions. Multivalent ligands with high receptor affinity offer powerful tools for manipulating these processes and advancing therapeutic strategies. However, designing easily modifiable, stable, and uniformly structured multivalent ligands remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a novel protein&#8208;based platform derived from modified tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein, which assembles into a stable, discoid scaffold capable of displaying up to 34 ligands with evenly distributed binding sites. By introducing the T103C modification, we achieve exceptional structural stability, allowing the platform to maintain integrity across a broad pH range (5&#8208;11) and during long&#8208;term storage (up to six months). Using the integrin&#8208;binding peptide SPPEPS as a model, we generate a multivalent TMV&#8208;SPPEPS that exhibits a 453&#8208;fold increase in integrin affinity over the monomeric peptide and can simultaneously cluster up to seven integrins. This multivalent platform promotes integrin clustering on cell surfaces, triggering mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis and effectively alleviating osteoarthritis in a rat model. These results highlight the potential of the TMV nanodisk as a versatile and stable platform for controlling receptor clustering and modulating intracellular signaling in diverse biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Entire Near Infrared&#8208;I Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, entire near infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) is achieved by continuously regulating the plasmon resonance absorption wavelength of gold nanorods (Au NRs) to precisely match ECL emission wavelength of Au NCs (abbreviated as Au NCs/Au NRs), which challenges the drawbacks of traditional single wavelength ECL enhancement strategy. Interestingly, within the range of 670 nm to 820 nm, the ECL intensity of Au NCs/Au NRs is 3 ~ 4 times higher than that of individual Au NCs due to the acceleration of electron&#8208;hole recombination and radiation transition rate through high energy electromagnetic field. As a proof of concept, the Au NCs/Au NRs with the ECL emission of 670 nm is employed as high&#8208;efficiency ECL emitter to achieve high&#8208;resolution ECL image and construct biosensor for realizing ultrasensitive detection of matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) related to liver failure. Significantly, the proposed ECL enhancement strategy effectively enhances the ECL emission of metal nanoclusters (M NCs) over a wide wavelength range and advances a new path for other tunable nanomaterials to enhance the ECL emission of M NCs, which is expected to be applied to in the field of multispectral ECL imaging, multimodal optoelectronic devices and spectrum&#8208;resolved multiplexed biosensing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Exciton Dissociation and Charge Transfer via Third&#8208;Motif Engineered Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Circulation&#8208;flow Synthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving effective exciton dissociation and charge transport in linear polymer photocatalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we fabricated three&#8208;motif cross&#8208;linked polymers by rationally introducing a third functional component into a two&#8208;motif linear polymer, which were employed for circulation&#8208;flow photocatalytic H2O2 production. By strategically modulating the third component, we precisely tuned the electronic structure, significantly lowering exciton binding energy and enlarging molecular dipole moment. Compared to the original linear configuration, the resulting cross&#8208;linked structure creates multidirectional electron transport channels. Combined experimental and calculation investigations demonstrate that these synergistic effects collectively promote exciton dissociation and intramolecular electron transfer. PAQ&#8208;TABPB photocatalyst with optimized third&#8208;motif accelerates oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;superoxide radical transformation by lowering the *OOH binding energy, thereby facilitating the two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway, attaining an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3351 &#956;mol/g/h. Notably, we constructed a circulation&#8208;flow reactor for photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2. Benefiting from improved gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer and efficient light irradiation, this flow&#8208;system achieved a 5.2&#8208;fold increase in H2O2 production compared to conventional batch reactor under the light intensity of 27 mW cm&#8208;2, reaching an accumulated yield of 3125 &#956;mol/g with stable recyclability. This work highlights the potential of multi&#8208;component polymeric photocatalysts and circulation&#8208;flow reactors for&#160;H2O2 photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Oxygen Coordination Steering *NO Hydrogenation in Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the hydrogenation behavior of *NO during electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is essential for designing catalysts with high selectivity toward ammonia (NH3) and valuable intermediates like hydroxylamine. Spinel cobalt oxides (Co3O4) are promising NO3RR electrocatalysts, yet the exact *NO hydrogenation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical calculations and systematic experiments to reveal that the hydrogenation pathway is dictated by the coordination environment, which can be tuned via crystal facet engineering. Co3O4 nanoparticles enriched with (111) facets (o&#8208;Co3O4) and (100) facets (c&#8208;Co3O4) were synthesized to expose 4&#8208; and 6&#8208;coordinated Co sites, respectively. Theoretical results show that o&#8208;Co3O4 favors nitrogen&#8208;site hydrogenation (*NO &#8594; *NHO), while c&#8208;Co3O4 promotes oxygen&#8208;site hydrogenation (*NO &#8594; *NOH), leading to distinct ratedetermining steps. This selectivity is experimentally supported by in situ spectroscopy, which detects the *NH2OH intermediate exclusively on o&#8208;Co3O4. Consequently, o&#8208;Co3O4 achieves superior NO3RR performance, with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.4% and an NH3 yield rate of 12.8 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at &#8722;0.4 V. This work uncovers the coordination&#8208;governed mechanism of *NO hydrogenation and establishes facet engineering as an effective strategy for directing reaction pathways in NO3RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Roles of Nonradical Electron&#8208;Donation Pathway in Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Boosted Interfacial Radical Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In conventional studies, radicals and nonradicals were often considered independent mechanisms for organic pollutant oxidation, with their potential interaction between radicals and nonradicals largely overlooked in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Herein, Cu&#8208;Co3O4 catalysts (x wt% Cu&#8208;Co3O4/OVs) featuring bifunctional bonding centers were fabricated, which enabled simultaneous co&#8208;capture of electron&#8208;rich contaminants and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) at their interfaces. The optimized 0.75 wt% Cu&#8208;Co3O4/OVs demonstrated exceptional efficiencies in degrading diverse micropollutants through synergistic oxidation pathways involving radicals and nonradical electron transfer process (ETP). Significantly, we found the unique dual electron migration pathways for PMS activation during synergistic oxidation process: besides the electron donation from Co centers, electron could be migrated via ETP from micropollutants to Co sites via heteroatomic Cu, serving as additional electron source for assisting PMS activation. In addition, synergistic oxidation pathways not only enhanced the generation of reactive species but also improved their utilization efficiency by shortening the migration distance of radicals. Such system exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability (up to 16 h) in wastewater treatment, with its environmental applicability further validated through life cycle assessment and bio&#8208;experiments. This work uncovered a previously unrecognized synergistic interaction between radical and nonradical pathways, offering new insights into the interfacial radical&#8208;mediated oxidation behavior for advanced wastewater remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Correlation between the Redox Potential, Spin State and Crystal Structure in a Series of Ferrous Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurately predicting the spin crossover (SCO) temperature (T1/2) in spin crossover compounds remains a significant challenge, due to their extreme sensitivity to minor variations in ligand and crystal structure. In this study, we uncover a critical link between the redox potential of ligands and SCO behavior within Hofmann&#8208;type clathrates {Fe(R&#8208;pbpy+)2[&#181;2&#8208;M(CN)4]2} (R = electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, M = Pd or Pt). Through precise tuning of the ligands' electronic properties, we establish a correlation between redox potential, space group, and SCO temperature, explained by an adaptation of Marcus theory of electron transfer. These findings not only provide a deeper understanding of the factors governing SCO behavior but also present a promising strategy for the rational design of SCO materials with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;Driven Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solid&#8208;State Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Hydrochromism, and Water&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) are promising candidates for chiral optoelectronics and sensing, but their weak solid&#8208;state fluorescence and chiroptical responses often limit practical utility. Here, we introduce a novel CCOF synthesized from achiral monomers, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarbaldehyde and hydrazine, via imine condensation with chiral induction strategy, yielding salicylaldehyde azine units with aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Optimized catalyst and chiral inducer stoichiometry endow the framework with exceptional chiroptical properties (|gabs| = 2.2 &#215; 10&#8208;2, ellipticity &#8776; 1000 mdeg). In the solid state, the CCOF exhibits intense red fluorescence (&#955;em &#8776; 645&#8201;nm) and favorable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL, |glum| = 5.2 &#215; 10&#8208;2), marking the first CCOF derived solely from achiral building blocks with robust solid&#8208;state CPL. When integrated into polydimethylsiloxane, it forms flexible and semitransparent composite films suitable for CPL&#8208;based applications. The CCOF also functions as highly enantioselective fluorescent sensors for chiral analytes, including 2&#8208;aminocyclohenanol and dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine. Furthermore, it demonstrates reversible hydrochromism, transitioning from yellow to orange (&#916;E &#8776; 42.7), and water&#8208;induced chiroptical enhancement (ellipticity up to 2100 medg, |gabs| = 5.5 &#215; 10&#8208;2), achieving the highest ground&#8208;state chirality reported for CCOFs through enol&#8208;to&#8208;keto tautomerism upon water adsorption. This stimulus&#8208;responsive CCOF with solid&#8208;state CPL properties provides new insights into chiral functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Controlled Lysine&#8208;Selective Crosslinking Decodes Protein Complexes and Dynamic Interactomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crosslinking strategies have emerged as an attractive technology for deciphering protein complexes and protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). However, commonly used crosslinking strategies present significant challenges for the precise analysis of protein complexes and dynamic PPIs in native biological environments. Here, we report the development of the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;inducible lysine&#8208;specific homobifunctional photo&#8208;crosslinkers and introduce Visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled Lysine&#8208;selective crosslinking (VL&#8208;XL) strategy for in&#8208;depth analysis of protein complexes and profiling dynamic interactomes in live cells. By synergistically integrating the advantages of temporal control, high biocompatibility, and lysine selectivity, the VL&#8208;XL strategy not only provides an effective solution for protein complexes studies&#8212;achieving residue&#8208;specific crosslinked peptides, delivering high&#8208;confidence data and streamlined MS data analysis&#8212;but also reveals dynamic interactomes in various scenarios. The VL&#8208;XL strategy successfully profiles the time&#8208;resolved, EGF&#8208;stimulated EGFR interactome, providing valuable insights into regulatory mechanisms of EGFR signaling. More importantly, the VL&#8208;XL strategy effectively unveils molecular glue degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome, leading to discovery of neo&#8208;substrates such as SESN2 and opening an innovative avenue for identifying novel targets for degradation. Overall, the VL&#8208;XL strategy offers a robust chemical tool for decoding protein complexes and dynamic interactomes, inspiring innovative solutions to address unresolved questions in proteomics, systems biology and drug discovery.</dc:description>
