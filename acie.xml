      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Activation Mechanism for Denitrogenative Rearrangement Over C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination</title>
      <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative rearrangement of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazole is developed over the competitive C(sp  3  )&#8211;H amination. This catalytic rearrangement reaction follows an unprecedented metalloradical activation mechanism. Employing the developed method, a wide number of complex&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic product classes have been accessed. The synthetic utility of this radical activation method is showcased with the short synthesis of a bioactive molecule. Collectively, this discovery underlines the progress of radical activation strategy that should find wide application in the perspective of medicinal chemistry, drug discovery and natural product synthesis research.</dc:description>

      <title>Vapochromic Behaviors of A Solid&#8208;State Supramolecular Polymer Based on Exo&#8208;Wall Complexation of Perethylated Pillar[5]arene with 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetracyanobenzene</title>
      <dc:description>The research for the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymers with specific functions accelerates the development of supramolecular and materials sciences. Here, we discover the different complexation modes of perethylated pillar[5]arene (  EtP5  ) with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (  TCNB  ) in various solvents. Driven by charge&#8208;transfer interaction,  TCNB  is enclosed in the cavity of  EtP5  in CHCl  3  , while  TCNB  complexes with  EtP5  at the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  in CH  2  Cl  2  . This is because the size of CH  2  Cl  2  matches the cavity of  EtP5  , forcing  TCNB  to complex with the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  . Furthermore, we fabricate a vapochromic solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer by exploiting the exo&#8208;wall complexation, which turns from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of alkyl aldehyde vapors. The adsorptive nature for alkyl aldehyde vapors comes from the unoccupied cavity of  EtP5  based on C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The vapochromic property is attributed to the change of the charge&#8208;transfer interaction caused by molecular rearrangement induced by vapor&#8208;capture in the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer.</dc:description>

      <title>Orthogonal Regulation of Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Couplings between Indazoles and Isoprene</title>
      <dc:description>Depending on the reactant property and reaction mechanism, one major regioisomer can be favored in a reaction that involves multiple active sites. Herein, an orthogonal regulation of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in the regiodivergent hydroamination of isoprene with indazoles is demonstrated. Under Pd&#8208;hydride catalysis, the 1,2&#8208; or 4,3&#8208;insertion pathway with respect to the electrophilic sites on isoprene could be controlled by the choice of ligands. In terms of the nucleophilic sites on indazoles, the reaction occurs at either the  N1&#8208; or  N2&#8208;position of indazoles is governed by the acid co&#8208;catalysts. Preliminary experimental studies have been performed to rationalize the mechanism and regioselectivity. This study not only contributes a practical tool for selective functionalization of isoprene, but also provides a guide to manipulate the regioselectivity for the  N&#8208;functionalization of indazoles.</dc:description>

      <title>Hexagonal RuSe2 Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanomaterials have emerged as promising alternatives to platinum (Pt) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the family of layered TMDs is mainly limited to Group IV&#8208;VII transition metals, while the synthesis of other group metals based layered TMDs still remains a challenge. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate by atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy that hexagonal RuSe2 (h&#8208;RuSe2) nanosheets with the mixture of 2H and 1T phases, a new member of layered TMDs family, can be obtained by a facile bottom&#8208;up colloidal synthetic approach. The obtained h&#8208;RuSe2, which can be transferred into the thermodynamically favorable phase of cubic RuSe2 (c&#8208;RuSe2) only after annealing at 600 &#176;C, exhibits Pt&#8208;like HER performance, with a 5&#8208;fold turnover frequency enhancement compared to the c&#8208;RuSe2 under alkaline media. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced adsorption free energies of H2O (&#916;GH2O*), optimized adsorption free energies of H (&#916;GH*) and increased conductivity of h&#8208;RuSe2 contribute to its superior HER activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Iron Porphyrins for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nature uses Fe porphyrin sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report an &#160; enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#160;  porphyrin  &#160;  1  as an efficient catalyst for both ORR and OER. Complex&#160;  1  , which bears a tethered imidazole for Fe binding, beats imidazole&#8208;free analogue&#160;  2  , with an anodic shift of ORR half&#8208;wave potential by 160 mV and a decrease of OER overpotential by 150 mV to get the benchmark current density at 10 mA/cm  2  . Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal Fe  V  =O form the O&#8722;O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of&#160;  trans  &#160;HO&#8722;Fe  V  =O, which is less effective to form O&#8722;O bond with hydroxide. As a practical demonstration, we assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery with&#160;  1  , which shows equal performance to that with Pt/Ir&#8208;based materials .</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
      <dc:description>Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8208;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using  in situ  IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO  2  formation rates than Pd alone.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization &#8208; Enhanced Nuclear Spin Optical Rotation</title>
      <dc:description>Nuclear Spin Optical Rotation (NSOR) has been investigated as a magneto&#8208;optical effect, which holds the potential for applications, including a hybrid optical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gradientless imaging. The intrinsic nature of NSOR renders its detection relatively insensitive, which has prevented it moving from a proof of concept to a method supporting chemical characterizations. In this work, the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization technique is introduced to provide nuclear spin polarization, increasing the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by several thousand times. NSOR signals of  1  H and  19  F nuclei are observed in a single scan for diluted compounds, which has made this effect suitable for the determination of electronic transitions from a specific nucleus in a large molecule.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nuclear Spin Optical Rotation (NSOR) has been investigated as a magneto&#8208;optical effect, which holds the potential for applications, including a hybrid optical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gradientless imaging. The intrinsic nature of NSOR renders its detection relatively insensitive, which has prevented it moving from a proof of concept to a method supporting chemical characterizations. In this work, the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization technique is introduced to provide nuclear spin polarization, increasing the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by several thousand times. NSOR signals of  1  H and  19  F nuclei are observed in a single scan for diluted compounds, which has made this effect suitable for the determination of electronic transitions from a specific nucleus in a large molecule.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Interrupted Pyridine Hydrogenation: Asymmetric Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an effective method to transform readily available arenes into saturated motifs, however, current hydrogenation strategies are limited to the formation of C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H bonds. The stepwise addition of hydrogen yields reactive unsaturated intermediates that are rapidly reduced. In contrast, the interruption of complete hydrogenation by further functionalization of unsaturated intermediates offers great potential for increasing chemical complexity in a single reaction step. Overcoming the tenet of full reduction in arene hydrogenation has been seldom demonstrated. In this work we report the synthesis of sought&#8208;after, enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from oxazolidinone&#8208;substiuted pyridines and water by an interrupted hydrogenation mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>A large starphene comprising pentacene branches</title>
      <dc:description>Starphenes are attractive compounds due to their characteristic physicochemical properties that are inherited from acenes, making them interesting compounds for organic electronics and optics. However, the instability and low solubility of larger starphene homologs make their synthesis extremely challenging. Herein, we present a new strategy leading to pristine [16]starphene in preparative scale. Our approach is based on a synthesis of a carbonyl&#8208;protected starphene precursor that is thermally converted in a solid&#8208;state form to the neat [16]starphene, which is then characterised with a variety of analytical methods, such as  13  C CP&#8208;MAS NMR, TGA, MS MALDI, UV&#8208;Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;resolution STM experiments unambiguously confirm its expected structure and reveal a moderate electronic delocalisation between the pentacene arms. Nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts NICS(1) are also calculated to survey its aromatic character.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The development of a platinum&#8208;catalyzed desaturation of cyclic ketones to their conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated counterparts is reported in this full article. A unique diene&#8208;platinum complex was identified to be an efficient catalyst, which enables direct metal&#8208;enolate formation. The reaction operates under mild conditions without using strong bases or acids. Good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds. A wide range of functional groups, including those sensitive to acids, bases/nucleophiles or palladium species, are tolerated, which represents a distinct feature from other known desaturation methods. Mechanistically, this platinum catalysis exhibits a fast and reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by a rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination process, which is different from the prior Pd&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method.

      <title>Imaging and analysis of isomeric unsaturated lipids through online photochemical derivatization of C=C bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Unraveling the complexity of the lipidome requires the development of novel approaches for the structural characterization of lipid species with isomer&#8208;level discrimination. Herein, we introduce an online photochemical approach for lipid isomer identification through selective derivatization of double bonds by reaction with singlet oxygen. Lipid hydroperoxide products are generated promptly after laser irradiation. Fragmentation of these species in a mass spectrometer produces diagnostic fragments, which reveal the C=C locations in the unreacted lipids. This approach uses an inexpensive light source and photosensitizer making it easy to incorporate into any lipidomics workflow. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for the shotgun profiling of C=C locations in different lipid classes present in tissue extracts using electrospray ionization (ESI) and ambient imaging of lipid species differing only by the location of C=C bonds using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI).</dc:description>

      <title>Minimization of Back&#8208;Electron Transfer Enables the Elusive sp3 C&#8211;H Functionalization of Secondary Anilines</title>
      <dc:description>Anilines are some of the most used class of substrates for application in photoinduced electron transfer.  N  ,  N  &#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;derivatives enable radical generation a to the  N  &#8208;atom by oxidation followed by deprotonation. This approach is however elusive to monosubstituted anilines owing to fast back&#8208;electron transfer (BET). Here we demonstrate that BET can be effectively minimised by using photoredox catalysis in the presence of an exogenous alkylamine. This approach synergistically aids aniline SET oxidation and then accelerates the following deprotonation. In this way, the generation of a&#8208;anilinoalkyl radicals is now possible and these species can be used in a general sense to achieve divergent sp  3  C&#8211;H functionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterometallic Actinide&#8208;Containing Photoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Dynamic and Static Tuning of Electronic&#160;Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Acquiring fundamental knowledge of properties of actinide&#8208;based materials is a necessary step to create new possibilities for addressing the current challenges in the nuclear energy and nuclear waste sectors. In this report, we established a photophysics&#8208;electronics correlation for actinide&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (An&#8208;MOFs) as a function of excitation wavelength, for the first time. A stepwise approach for dynamically modulating electronic properties was applied for the first time towards actinide&#8208;based heterometallic MOFs through integration of photochromic linkers. Optical cycling, modeling of density of states near the Fermi edge, conductivity measurements, and photoisomerization kinetics were employed to shed light on the process of tailoring optoelectronic properties of An&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, the first photochromic MOF&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor, in which the field&#8208;effect response could be changed through light exposure was constructed. As a demonstration, the change in current on light exposure was sufficient to operate a two&#8208;LED fail&#8208;safe indicator circuit.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acquiring fundamental knowledge of properties of actinide&#8208;based materials is a necessary step to create new possibilities for addressing the current challenges in the nuclear energy and nuclear waste sectors. In this report, we established a photophysics&#8208;electronics correlation for actinide&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (An&#8208;MOFs) as a function of excitation wavelength, for the first time. A stepwise approach for dynamically modulating electronic properties was applied for the first time towards actinide&#8208;based heterometallic MOFs through integration of photochromic linkers. Optical cycling, modeling of density of states near the Fermi edge, conductivity measurements, and photoisomerization kinetics were employed to shed light on the process of tailoring optoelectronic properties of An&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, the first photochromic MOF&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor, in which the field&#8208;effect response could be changed through light exposure was constructed. As a demonstration, the change in current on light exposure was sufficient to operate a two&#8208;LED fail&#8208;safe indicator circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Bright and Robust Phosphorescence Achieved via Non&#8208;Covalent Clipping</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphorescent compounds with high emission intensities are important for their practical applications, which require to lower the susceptibility of triplet excitons to surroundings. Herein a non&#8208;covalent clipping strategy has been developed to attain this objective, by designing a tweezer receptor to encapsulate Pt(II)&#8208;based triplet emitters via two&#8208;fold &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. The Pt(II) emitters display robust phosphorescence by virtue of synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects, which are hardly influenced by emitter concentration, oxygen content, and solvent polarity changes. The phosphorescent colors are elaborately modulated by varying ligand substitutes on Pt(II) emitters. Circularly polarized phosphorescence is further amplified for chiral Pt(II) emitters, by taking advantage of dual phosphorescence and chirality enhancement upon non&#8208;covalent tweezer complexation. Overall, the clipping approach paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance phosphorescent materials with bright emission and environmental robustness.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. While applying RAFT photopolymerization to additive manufacturing has been explored in some early works, these systems are unable to produce commercially viable build speeds and are only printable if high concentrations of a select few divinyl crosslinking monomers are used. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation (&#955;max = 405 nm). The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1 cm/h, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object. The rapidly curing photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT 3D printing process reported herein paves the way for a new generation of previously unprintable RAFT functionalized materials to be printed with high resolution and at commercially competitive build speeds.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Live cell imaging of lysosome positioning and motility is critical to the study of lysosome status and function for pharmacological interventions. To create a super stable lysosomal probe for long&#8208;term live cell imaging, we design and synthesize an aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex that emits light via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly in water at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies transform from nanoparticles to sturdy packed networks stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment. Upon short time/low dose treatment of the iridium complex at passage 0, live cell lysosomal tracking is applicable beyond the 14th passage of cells with high labelling rate and a mild decline in luminescent intensity. The illuminated lysosomes are trackable using super&#8208;resolution imaging to study their response to cellular processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable De Novo Synthesis of Aldgarose and Total Synthesis of Aldgamycin N</title>
      <dc:description>Since the accompanying study had shown that the introduction of the eponymous aldgarose sugar to the C5&#8208;OH group of the macrocyclic aglycone of aldgamycin N is most difficult, if not even impossible, the synthesis route was revised and the critical glycosidation performed at an earlier stage. To mitigate the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategic amendment, a practical and scalable de novo synthesis of this precious branched octose was developed. The actual glycoside formation required exceptionally mild conditions; it commenced with the reaction of the aglycone with the trichloroacetimidate donor to give a transient orthoester, which slowly rearranged to the desired aldgaropyranoside. The presence of the many polar peripheral groups in the resulting product did not impede the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of the macrolide ring itself: specifically, the contained propargylic alcohol entity was readily transformed into the characteristic acyloin motif of the target by a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed  trans  &#8208;hydrostannation followed by a modified Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling. The modularity of the synthesis plan underlying this first conquest of an aldgamycin macrolide holds the promise that other members of this family of antibiotics and relatives are also well within reach.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the accompanying study had shown that the introduction of the eponymous aldgarose sugar to the C5&#8208;OH group of the macrocyclic aglycone of aldgamycin N is most difficult, if not even impossible, the synthesis route was revised and the critical glycosidation performed at an earlier stage. To mitigate the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategic amendment, a practical and scalable de novo synthesis of this precious branched octose was developed. The actual glycoside formation required exceptionally mild conditions; it commenced with the reaction of the aglycone with the trichloroacetimidate donor to give a transient orthoester, which slowly rearranged to the desired aldgaropyranoside. The presence of the many polar peripheral groups in the resulting product did not impede the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of the macrolide ring itself: specifically, the contained propargylic alcohol entity was readily transformed into the characteristic acyloin motif of the target by a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed  trans  &#8208;hydrostannation followed by a modified Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling. The modularity of the synthesis plan underlying this first conquest of an aldgamycin macrolide holds the promise that other members of this family of antibiotics and relatives are also well within reach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Efficient Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes: Selective Synthesis of Adipates and Other Aliphatic Diesters</title>

However, the complex reaction network of regioisomeric carbonylation and isomerization pathways, make a selective and direct transformation particularly difficult.

      <title>Strong Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Two&#8208;dimensional Na&#8208;In Halide Perovskites Triggered by Antimony Doping</title>
      <dc:description>Soft lattice and strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling have been demonstrated in layered double perovskites (LDPs) recently, therefore LDP represents a promising class of compounds as excellent self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emitters for applications in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. However, few LDPs with outstanding STE emissions have been discovered, and their optoelectronic properties are still unclear. Based on the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Cs  2  NaInCl  6  , we synthesized two 2D derivatives (PEA)  4  NaInCl  8  : Sb (PEA = phenethylamine) and (PEA)  2  CsNaInCl  7  : Sb with monolayer and bilayer inorganic sheets by a combination of dimensional reduction and Sb&#8208;doping. Bright broadband emissions were obtained for the first time under ambient temperature and pressure, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 48.7% (mono&#8208;) and 29.3% (bi&#8208;), superior to current known LDPs. Spectroscopic characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations of excited state indicate the broadband emissions originate from STEs trapped at the introduced [SbCl  6  ]  3&#8208;  octahedron. Our results provide important insights for designing LDPs with broadband emissions.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Featured Rigid Polyimides Affording Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with High External Quantum Efficiency Up to 21.0%</title>
      <dc:description>A series of rigid nonconjugated polyimide (PI)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers were reported for the first time, based on a &#8220;&#8208;TADF&#8208;Linker&#8208;Host&#8208;&#8221;strategy. Among of which, the TADF unit contains a typical TADF luminous core structure, the host unit exhibits effective conjugation length that endows polyimide with high triplet energy, and the linker unit has an aliphatic ring structure to improve solubility and inhibit intramolecular charge transfer effect, thus making the polymers exhibit the TADF property of the TADF unit. All the TADF polyimides exhibit high thermal stability (  T  g  &gt; 308  o  C) and refractive index (1.76&#8208;1.79). Remarkably, highly&#8208;efficient polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) based on the polymers are successfully realized, leading to a maximal external quantum efficiency of 21.0% along with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Such an outstanding efficiency is amongst the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of nonconjugated PLEDs, confirming the effectiveness of our structural design strategy, providing helpful and valuable guidance on the development of highly&#8208;efficient fluorescent polymer materials and PLEDs.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Functionalized Aldimines as 1,4&#8208;Dipoles</title>
      <dc:description>The use of functionalized aldimines has been demonstrated as newly structural 1,4&#8208;dipole precursors under carbene catalysis. More importantly, enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed using carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (  R  )&#8208; and (  S  )&#8208; enantiomers of six&#8208;membered heterocycles with quaternary carbon centers. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and good enantiomeric ratio. DFT calculation results indicated that hydrogen bond C&#8208;H&#8230;F interactions between the catalyst and substrate are the key factors for controlling and even switching the enantioselectivity. These new 1,4&#8208;dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.</dc:description>

DFT calculation results indicated that hydrogen bond C&#8208;H&#8230;F interactions between the catalyst and substrate are the key factors for controlling and even switching the enantioselectivity. These new 1,4&#8208;dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Effect of MOF Database Selection on the Assessment of Gas Storage and Separation Potentials of MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>Development of computation&#8208;ready metal&#8208;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) has accelerated high&#8208;throughput computational screening (HTCS) of materials to identify the best candidates for gas storage and separation. These DBs were constructed using structural curations to make MOFs directly usable for molecular simulations , which caused the same MOF to be reported with different structural features in different DBs. We examined thousands of common materials of the two recently updated, very widely used MOF DBs to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH  4  , H  2  , CO  2  uptakes and CH  4  /H  2  separation performances of MOFs. Results showed that DB selection has a significant effect on the calculated gas uptakes and ideal selectivities of materials at low pressure. A detailed analysis on the curated structures was provided to isolate the critical elements of MOFs determining the gas uptakes. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.</dc:description>

Although the insertion of non&#8208;metallic ions has been achieved in aqueous zinc batteries, the co&#8208;insertion chemistry of non&#8208;metallic cations is still a challenge.

      <title>Boosting Zn electrode reversibility in aqueous electrolyte using low&#8208;cost antisolvents</title>
      <dc:description>Antisolvent addition has been widely studied in crystallization in the pharmaceutical industries by breaking the solvation balance of the original solution. Here we report a similar antisolvent strategy to boost Zn reversibility via regulation of the electrolyte on a molecular level. By adding for example methanol into ZnSO  4  electrolyte, the free water and coordinated water in Zn  2+  solvation sheath gradually interact with the antisolvent, which minimizes water activity and weakens Zn  2+  solvation. Concomitantly, dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition occurs via change in the deposition orientation, as evidenced by in situ optical microscopy. Zn reversibility is significantly boosted in antisolvent electrolyte of 50% methanol by volume (Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50%) even under harsh environments of &#8722;20 &#176;C and 60 &#176;C. Additionally, the suppressed side reactions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50% electrolyte significantly enhance performance of Zn/polyaniline coin and pouch cells. We demonstrate this low&#8208;cost strategy can be readily generalized to other solvents, indicating its practical universality.

      <title>An Unprecedented Pillar&#8208;cage Fluorinated Hybrid Porous Framework with Highly Efficient Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Despite much intense investigation on the C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation, the trade&#8208;off between the adsorption capacity and separation selectivity is still tricky. To overcome the dilemma, we have rationally synthesized an ultra&#8208;stable fluorinated hybrid porous material SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA with the  ith&#8208;d  topology. Completely differing from the famous pillar&#8208;layer fluorinated materials, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA possesses a unique pillar&#8208;cage structure, in which the SiF  6  2&#8208;  anions cross&#8208;link two adjacent metal nodes as pillars to stabilize the three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by icosahedral and tetrahedral cages. As anticipated, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has high BET surface area (1330 m  2  /g) as well as high C  2  H  2  uptake (185 cm  3  /g at 298 K and 1 bar).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite much intense investigation on the C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation, the trade&#8208;off between the adsorption capacity and separation selectivity is still tricky. To overcome the dilemma, we have rationally synthesized an ultra&#8208;stable fluorinated hybrid porous material SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA with the  ith&#8208;d  topology. Completely differing from the famous pillar&#8208;layer fluorinated materials, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA possesses a unique pillar&#8208;cage structure, in which the SiF  6  2&#8208;  anions cross&#8208;link two adjacent metal nodes as pillars to stabilize the three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by icosahedral and tetrahedral cages. As anticipated, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has high BET surface area (1330 m  2  /g) as well as high C  2  H  2  uptake (185 cm  3  /g at 298 K and 1 bar). At the same time, due to the obvious difference in the adsorption performance of CO  2  and C  2  H  2  especially in the low pressure area, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA also exhibits an excellent C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation   performance  (breakthrough time up to 68 min/g at 298K and 1 bar).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of Core@Shell Cu&#8208;Ni@Pt&#8208;Cu Nano&#8208;Octahedra and Their Improved MOR Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Fabrication of 3  d  metal&#8208;based core@shell nanocatalysts with engineered Pt&#8208;surfaces provides an effective approach for improving the catalytic performance. The challenges in such preparation include shape control of the 3  d  metallic cores and thickness control of the Pt&#8208;based shells. Herein, we report a colloidal seed&#8208;mediated method to prepare octahedral CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nanocrystals using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. By precisely controlling the synthesis conditions including the deposition rate and diffusion rate of the shell&#8208;formation through tuning the capping ligand, reaction temperature, and heating rate, uniform Pt&#8208;based shells can be achieved with a thickness of &lt; 1 nm. The resultant carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nano&#8208;octahedra showed superior activity in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu nano&#8208;polyhedron counterparts, demonstrating that both the lattice strain and shape effects arising from the as&#8208;prepared CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu octahedral nanocatalysts play a crucial role in MOR performance.</dc:description>

      <title>An efficient Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 multi&#8208;interfacial oxygen&#8208;evolving electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Although the Turing structures, or stationary reaction&#8208;diffusion patterns, have received increasing attention in biology and chemistry, making such unusual patterns on inorganic solids is fundamentally challenging. We report a simple cation exchange approach to produce Turing&#8208;type Ag  2  Se on CoSe  2  nanobelts relied on diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The resultant  Turing&#8208;type  Ag  2  Se&#8208;CoSe  2  material is highly effective to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes with an 84.5% anodic energy efficiency. Electrochemical measurements show that the intrinsic OER activity correlates linearly with the length of Ag  2  Se&#8208;CoSe  2  interfaces, determining that such Turing&#8208;type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X&#8208;ray absorption and computational simulations, we ascribe the excellent OER performance to the optimized adsorption energies for critical oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates at the unconventional interfaces.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although the Turing structures, or stationary reaction&#8208;diffusion patterns, have received increasing attention in biology and chemistry, making such unusual patterns on inorganic solids is fundamentally challenging. We report a simple cation exchange approach to produce Turing&#8208;type Ag  2  Se on CoSe  2  nanobelts relied on diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The resultant  Turing&#8208;type  Ag  2  Se&#8208;CoSe  2  material is highly effective to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes with an 84.5% anodic energy efficiency. Electrochemical measurements show that the intrinsic OER activity correlates linearly with the length of Ag  2  Se&#8208;CoSe  2  interfaces, determining that such Turing&#8208;type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X&#8208;ray absorption and computational simulations, we ascribe the excellent OER performance to the optimized adsorption energies for critical oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates at the unconventional interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stanene&#8208;Based Nanosheets for&#160;&#946;&#8208;Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a superior modality for cancer treatment owing to the non&#8208;invasiveness and high tissue&#8208;penetrating depth. However, developing biocompatible nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers with efficient SDT capability remains challenging. Here, we employed a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3 eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano&#8208;sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US&#8208;triggered separation of electron (e  &#8722;  )&#8722;hole (h  +  ) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT&#8208;enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.</dc:description>

      <title>Exclusive strain effect boosts overall water splitting in PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Core/shell nanocatalysts are a class of promising materials, which achieve the enhanced catalytic activities through the synergy between ligand effect and strain effect. However, it has been challenging to disentangle the contributions from the two effects, which hinders the rational design of superior core/shell nanocatalysts. Herein, we report precise synthesis of PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals, which can significantly boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER)  via  the exclusive strain effect. This is accomplished by heteroepitaxial coating of four Ir atomic layers onto PdCu nanoparticle. The relatively thick Ir shell eliminates the ligand effect, but creates a compressive strain of ~3.60%. The strained PdCu/Ir catalysts can deliver an overpotential of 283 mV with a corresponding current density of 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  and a mass activity of 1.83 A mg  &#8722;2  Ir  at 1.51 V (  vs.  RHE). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain in Ir shell downshifts the d&#8208;band center and weakens the binding of the intermediates, leading to the enhanced OER activity. The compressive strain is also found to boost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. It is further demonstrated that the strained PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals are excellent catalysts for both anode and cathode in overall water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysis, attaining an impressive cell voltage of 1.583 V at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  with a long&#8208;term stability of 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Photocatalytic anticancer profile of a Ir(III) photocatalyst (  Ir3  ) with strong light absorption, high turnover frequency, and excellent biocompatibility is reported.  Ir3  showed selective photo&#8208;cytotoxicity against cisplatin&#8208; and sorafenib&#8208;resistant cell lines while remaining dormant to normal cell lines in the dark.  Ir3  exhibited excellent photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular co&#8208;enzyme, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and amino acids via a single electron transfer mechanism. The photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance and change in mitochondrial membrane potential resulted in necrosis and apoptosis of cancer cells. Importantly,  Ir3  exhibited high biocompatibility and photo&#8208;catalytic anticancer efficiency as evident from  in&#8208;vivo  zebrafish and mouse cancer models. To the best of our knowledge,  Ir3  is the first Ir(III) based photocatalyst with such a high biocompatibility and photocatalytic anticancer therapeutic effect.</dc:description>

We report the integration of four complementary process analytical technology tools (NMR, UV/vis, IR and UHPLC) in the multistep synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, mesalazine.
