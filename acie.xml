We demonstrate the unique reactivity of a mesoionic imine with bis&#8208;aryl carbodiimides, forming an MII&#8208;CDI adduct at room temperature via a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;H shift. These MII&#8208;CDI adducts serve as important synthons for mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene&#8208;stabilized nitreones (I) and guanidinate&#8208;type ligands.








Abstract
In this study, we report our recent findings on the synthesis and reactivity of a novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine&#8208;type mesoionic imine&#8208;carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) adduct. Unlike reported NHC&#8208;CDI adducts, formed by the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with CDI, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift (1,3&#8208;H shift), resulting in guanidine&#8208;type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3&#8208;H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The MII&#8208;CDI adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene (MIC&#8208;ADC)&#8208;based nitreone (N(I)) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behavior of these nitreone (N(I)) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these MII&#8208;CDI adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of MII in contrast to their N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (NHI) congeners.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle Monolayer&#8208;Decorated Nanopipette Enabling in Situ Monitoring of Single&#8208;Cell Redox Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette was developed to visualize single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. Leveraging strong near&#8208;field coupling within the monolayer that forms uniform hotspots, our method enables highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of redox metabolism changes, which deepens the understanding of single&#8208;cell ferroptosis.








Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of how single cells respond to redox perturbations is pivotal for predicting cell fate decisions. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;active nanopipettes hold promise for single&#8208;cell analysis, yet challenges remain in achieving both signal sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, a plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette has been developed, which serves as a biomimetic endoscope to monitor single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. This is accomplished by the conformal transferring of gold nanoparticle monolayer onto the nanopipette followed by the functionalization of redox&#8208;responsive probes. The strong near&#8208;field coupling within monolayer forms uniform hotspots, enabling highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of SERS signals changes triggered by redox species. Modulated by the nanopipette technology, the endoscope allows for in situ monitoring of global redox states with low invasiveness and high spatial resolution. Further, study of ferroptosis events via simultaneous optical and electrical recording elucidates the correlation between redox imbalance and membrane damage during various ferroptosis&#8208;inducers stimulation, which has not been observed at the single&#8208;cell level. This work provides profound insights into the cellular redox dynamics, contributing to a deeper understanding of related physiopathological pathways.

         <title>Linking Metallacycle Transfer with Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis to Generate Polyacetylenes of Unprecedented Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unusual low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap polyacetylenes bearing ring&#8208;fused tellurophene and vinyl side chains were prepared by combining metallacycle transfer (Hf/p&#8208;block element exchange) with ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) into a single modular and efficient protocol. 








Abstract
A hafnium&#8208;based bicyclic precursor (COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Hf) has been prepared that enables tandem Hf/E metallacycle transfer (E&#160;=&#160;main group element) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclooctatetraene (COT) units to generate a new family of structurally unique polyacetylenes. Highlights from this work include a tellurophene&#8208;grafted polyacetylene, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Te, and a polyacetylene with unsaturated vinyl side chains, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;vinyl. The resulting polymers can be processed into films that yield optical band gaps as low as 1.6&#160;eV, representing promising new architectures for the optoelectronics community.

         <title>Quantitative Tracking of Apoptotic Caspase&#8208;3 In Vivo for Early Evaluation of Radiation Therapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescence probe was developed to accurately quantify caspase&#8208;3 induced by radiotherapy in vivo by emitting a dual signal at 1550&#160;nm as a reference and response signal, respectively. The detection limit for caspase&#8208;3 was determined to be 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. The established early efficacy evaluation system can effectively predict the therapeutic outcome of cancer radiotherapy and guide the optimization of treatment plans.








Abstract
Traditional responsive fluorescent probes are predominantly restricted to qualitative biomarker detection, incapable of delivering real&#8208;time quantitative analysis or spatial mapping of protease activity in vivo, which is essential for elucidating disease progression. To overcome this, a ratiometric second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) probe (DCNP@IR&#8208;806) was developed by conjugating caspase&#8208;3&#8208;specific peptide substrates and sensitizer molecules (IR&#8208;806) to lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP). DCNP@IR&#8208;806 achieves single&#8208;channel emission at 1550&#160;nm under dual excitation, facilitating self&#8208;calibrated quantification and real&#8208;time monitoring of activated caspase&#8208;3 in vivo. Radiotherapy induces tumor cell apoptosis, thereby activating caspase&#8208;3, which subsequently triggers a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II FL signal change of DCNP@IR&#8208;806. The ratiometric signal demonstrates a linear correlation with caspase&#8208;3 concentration, achieving a detection limit of 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. Then, an early efficacy assessment system capable of predicting radiotherapy outcomes within 12 h post&#8208;treatment was constructed, markedly expediting evaluation compared to traditional methods that require weeks. This rapid, precise, and user&#8208;friendly assessment facilitates timely optimization of therapeutic regimens to enhance efficacy while minimizing side effects. This platform represents a significant advancement in precision oncology by transitioning from qualitative imaging to in situ quantitative biomarker tracking.

         <title>Amide Chemistry Enables Redox Locking of Cyclic Disulfides for Polypeptide Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of a family of cyclic dichalcogenides derived from cysteine is significantly enhanced against reductants upon acylation of the alpha&#8208;amino group. Amide formation serves as a redox lock, offering a mechanism to achieve selectivity in the assembly of large cyclic polypeptides on a water&#8208;compatible solid support.








Abstract
A practical strategy in synthetic organic chemistry for shutting down temporarily the nucleophilicity of thiols is to exploit their redox properties by converting them into disulfides. The stability of such a thiol protection in reductive medium can be sensitive to microenvironmental changes, including chemical modifications occurring nearby. Although difficult to achieve, large shifts in disulfide stability might provide a practical mean for bringing selectivity in a reacting system comprising multiple thiol functionalities. Here we report that the stability of a cyclic disulfide increases dramatically upon acylation of an amino group placed in the vicinity of the S&#9472;S bond. The gain in stability is so pronounced that the amide bond formation acts as a redox lock. We describe the application of such a redox switch to the chemoselective assembly of polypeptides by thiol&#8208;based peptide ligation chemistries.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Delocalized Cu2+ Activates Spin Channels in Spinel Oxides to Selectively Produce 1O2 for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an electron&#8208;delocalized strategy to unlock FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+ spin channel, inducing intermolecular electron transfer of two PMS for selective 1O2 generation. The directed electron transfer behavior not only maintains the catalyst stability, but also immensely reduces the 1O2 generation energy barrier and improves the PMS utilization.








Abstract
Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron&#8208;delocalization strategy that unlocks ATd2+&#9472;O&#9472;BOh3+ electron&#8208;transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu0.8Fe2.2O4), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective 1O2 generation. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron&#8208;delocalized Cu2+ triggers a high spin&#8208;state of O in FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the FeOh3+ adsorption site to the FeTd2+ adsorption site through FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO4&#8226;&#8722; and SO5&#8226;&#8722; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO4&#8226;&#8722; rapidly oxidizes SO5&#8226;&#8722; into 1O2, enhancing 1O2 generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of 1O2 in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale&#8208;up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48&#160;h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective 1O2 generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.

Here, an atom&#8208;economic, high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route for &#936;TP synthesis is presented. A new chemoenzymatic route for m1&#936;TP synthesis was developed. The method offers enhanced reaction efficiency and sustainability compared to pure chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are critical monomer building blocks of mRNA therapeutics, yet efficient, scalable methods of their synthesis from readily accessible substrates remain underdeveloped. m1&#936;TP is a major cost factor of production of the current COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. We herein report a notably atom&#8208;economic and high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route toward &#936;TP and present two chemoenzymatic routes for producing m1&#936;TP at &#8764;200&#160;mg scale of isolated compound. Biocatalytic cascade rearrangement of uridine delivered &#936;MP or &#936; in high yields. Acetonide&#8208;protected &#936;MP was selectively N1&#8208;methylated using dimethyl sulfate and subsequently converted to the triphosphate through efficient kinase cascade reaction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae uridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate kinase was shown for ATP&#8208;dependent phosphorylation of m1&#936;MP to m1&#936;DP and m1&#936;TP synthesis was catalyzed by Escherichia coli acetate kinase which also served to regenerate ATP by acetyl phosphate. Benchmarked against chemical route converting the enzymatically produced &#936; into m1&#936;TP, the novel chemoenzymatic route from &#936;MP offered improved metrics of reaction efficiency and sustainability. The synthetic &#936;TP and m1&#936;TP replaced UTP for mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription. Overall, this study shows the productive integration of chemical methylation with enzymatic cascade reactions for C&#9472;C coupling and phosphorylation toward an efficient preparation of m1&#936;TP.

         <title>Bone&#8208;Inspired Sustainable Hydrogel Electrolytes for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a bone&#8208;inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel) using Zn&#8208;doped hydroxyapatite (Zn&#8208;HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. Its bone&#8208;like structural composition ensured excellent sustainability, water retention ability, and mechanical properties, addressing Zn anode issues. The zinc superionic conductor Zn&#8208;HA created dual Zn2&#8314; transport channels, accelerating desolvation and enhancing AZMB performance.








Abstract
Hydrogels are promising electrolytes for use in aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs). However, the problems associated with the Zn anodes cannot be eliminated using current hydrogel electrolytes, and their poor sustainability has also been neglected. We have developed a bone&#8208;inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel) composed of Zn&#8208;doped hydroxyapatite (Zn&#8208;HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. The bone&#8208;like structure and strong molecular interactions in the biodegradable, recyclable, and biocompatible components endow Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel with excellent sustainability, water retention, and mechanical properties, which solves the problems currently associated with Zn anodes. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;HA superionic conductor exhibits an ultrahigh intrinsic ionic conductivity and accelerated Zn2+ desolvation process. The dual&#8208;channels for Zn2+ transport in Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel result in high ionic conductivity (32.5 mS cm&#8722;1) and transference number (0.80), facilitating uniform Zn plating/stripping and durable working stability. As a result, Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel ensures ultrastable cycling performance with a cumulative capacity of 5 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 for Zn/Zn cells and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 82.4% after 2000 cycles for full cells, surpassing the capabilities of current hydrogel electrolytes, and has potential applications in sustainable and functional energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Chemoselectivity in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) Alkyne Cyclotrimerization</title>

Chemoselectivity Challenge: A precise catalyst design allows for chemoselectivity control over alkyne reactivity to yield pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) cyclotrimerization. Operative mechanism has been elucidated by means of stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations.








Abstract
The synthesis of pentafulvenes with varied substituents has been efficiently achieved using novel rhodium&#8208;based catalysts via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) alkyne cyclotrimerization. A rational design of the catalyst structure, including pyridonato, NHC, and CO ligands, ensures the alkyne chemoselectivity and prevents the formation of robust rhodium&#8208;fulvene species. Furthermore, the judicious choice of acidity and steric properties of different alkynes enables the preparation of cross&#8208;coupled fulvene derivatives. Stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations, shed light on the reaction mechanism, showing that it includes an initial alkyne deprotonation, two successive alkyne insertions, cyclization, and protonolysis, the first insertion being the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>A Butterfly&#8208;Like Fluorescent Tracker for Dynamic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamics of reversible polymerization could be visualized using a butterfly&#8208;shaped fluorescent tracker. The emission color showed strong dependence on the microenvironmental confinement within the dynamic polymers, correlating with molecular weight, backbone structure, conformation, and aggregation state. The dynamic polymerization of poly(disulfide)s could be tracked via the multicolored emission of the fluorescent probe, demonstrating high sensitivity to a wide range of poly(disulfide)s.








Abstract
Optically tracking constitutional dynamics provides a time&#8208;resolved, non&#8208;invasive, and visually interpretable approach to unraveling microscopic complexity in system chemistry. Here we report a butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent tracker, featuring excited&#8208;state conformational adaptivity, capable of sensing the subtle microscopic dynamics of polymers as a ratiometric fluorescent probe. The key design is coupling the fluorophore's conformational relaxation dynamics to microenvironmental constraints imposed by polymer structural features&#8212;such as chain length, conformation, and inter&#8208;/intramolecular interactions. By employing the fluorophore as a bifunctional initiator, we grafted two dynamic polymer chains onto its phenyl &#8220;wings&#8221;, creating a single&#8208;fluorophore tracker that dynamically interacts with its environment. This system functions as a highly sensitive ratiometric probe, optically reporting microscopic polymer dynamics in real time, including polymerization kinetics, chain folding/unfolding transitions, and depolymerization processes. Systematic studies demonstrate the broad applicability of this concept across diverse polymeric systems, with distinct emission signatures enabling differentiation between systems. The probe's ability to correlate fluorescence output with microenvironmental changes reveals its utility in both fundamental and applied contexts. We anticipate this conformationally adaptive fluorescent platform will advance research in dynamic chemistry, particularly for real&#8208;time monitoring of polymeric systems and the development of responsive materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>An advanced metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer is designed and synthesized by utilizing a titanium&#8211;polyoxometalate (Ti&#8208;POM) to bridge organic and inorganic moieties, and it is utilized as an anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) to stabilize lithium metal anodes. The MSP&#8208;IPL possesses superior ion&#8208;transfer ability and outstanding electrochemical/ambient stability. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs can effectively bind with PF6&#8722;, enhancing Li+ transference number (tLi+&#160;= 0.607), promoting uniform distribution of Li+ flux.








Abstract
The uncontrolled lithium (Li) dendrite growth and fragile native solid electrolyte interphase formation have severely hindered the practical development of Li metal batteries. Herein, a coordinatively cross&#8208;linked metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer as anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) is developed by utilizing titanium(IV)&#8211;polyoxometalates (Ti&#8208;POMs) as hexatopic linkers to bridge organic and inorganic moieties. The constructed MSP&#8208;IPL possesses high electrochemical stability, superior ion&#8208;transfer ability, and good air stability. Due to its high film formation uniformity and mechanical tenacity, the MSP&#8208;IPL can effectively avoid nonuniform Li deposition caused by the tip effect, thus inhibiting Li dendrite proliferation. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs in polymer skeleton can efficiently bind with PF6&#8722; anions, thus increasing Li+ transference number and promoting homogeneous Li+ distribution. The reprocessability and self&#8208;healing ability endowed by dynamic coordination bonds enable the MSP&#8208;IPL to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interface contact. Consequently, high&#8208;loading Li||LiFePO4 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries based on MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li anodes demonstrate impressive cyclability and extraordinary rate capability. Even at a low temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li||NCM811 batteries can still cycle stably for over 500 cycles (equivalent to 138 days) with a considerable capacity retention of 86.8%. This work presents a promising solution for developing practical low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries.

         <title>Reversing Blocking Order of Trithiocarbonate&#8208;Mediated RAFT Polymerizations Using Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Acrylic&#8208;methacrylic block copolymers have limited accessibility due to monomer order requirements in reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques leading to a vast landscape of block copolymers being understudied. Using unique PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization conditions, a controlled chain extension of poly(methyl acrylate) with methyl methacrylate could be performed resulting in a high&#8208;molecular weight thermoplastic elastomer.








Abstract
Many acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymer sequences remain inaccessible due to synthetic limitations. Herein, photoinduced electron/energy transfer (PET) catalysis is leveraged to reverse blocking order limitations in trithiocarbonate (TTC)&#8208;mediated reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We synthesized poly(methyl acrylate&#8208;b&#8208;methyl methacrylate) by PET&#8208;RAFT using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, achieving predictable, linear increases in molecular weight with conversion. Kinetics studies showed that adding a tertiary amine (triethanolamine) introduced a reversible redox reaction to stabilize the TTC radical during chain extensions, leading to more uniform block copolymers (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.47) compared to block copolymers synthesized without amine (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.56). To highlight the utility of this method, triblock copolymers of poly(methyl acrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) blocks were investigated. The order of acrylic and methacrylic blocks impacted the physical properties of compositionally similar polymeric materials. For example, a high molecular weight triblock copolymer (P(MMA&#8208;b&#8208;MA&#8208;b&#8208;MMA), Mn&#160;=&#160;564&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) thermoplastic elastomer showed exceptional strain (&gt;1600%). Overall, we report (i) a new methodology to unlock synthetic access to acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymers using TTCs and photocatalysis, (ii) insight into photocatalyst&#8208;mediated radical polymerization, and (iii) synthesis of new high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Si/Carbon&#8208;dots with Surface N&#8208;C Sites Promoting Proton and Electron Transfers in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH step is considered the rate&#8208;determining step in the oxygen reduction reaction. Silane chain&#8208;grafted carbon dots with N&#8208;C active sites help overcome the energy barrier through promoting proton and electron transfers, thereby enhancing H2O2 production in photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed through either a two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron pathway, both of which are important for a wide range of applications. The intermediate conversion of *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH recognized as the rate&#8208;determining step in ORR, with its efficiency strongly dependent on the nature of active sites at the surface of a catalyst. Herein, Si&#8208;supported carbon dots (Si&#8208;CDs) are introduced as cocatalysts in a photocatalytic system, where their nitrogen&#8211;carbon sites play a pivotal role in lowering the energy barrier for *OOH formation by promoting proton and electron transfers, thus enhancing the H2O2 production rate in ORR. This strategy is broadly applicable across a wide range of photocatalysts, both with and without use of sacrificial agents. The H2O2 production rate for Zn0.5Cd0.5S (30&#160;mg) increased from 13.0 to 40.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 when 0.6&#160;mg of Si&#8208;CDs were added. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations are conducted to reveal the reaction pathway and the reduced energy requirements for the *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH conversion. This study provides a unique example of overcoming a key barrier in ORR using a metal&#8208;free catalyst and promotes potential applications in various fields.

         <title>Transition Metal Atom&#8211;Cluster Synergistic Modification with Tuned d&#8208;band Center Imparts Longevous Potassium Metal Anodes</title>

The transition metal atom&#8211;cluster synergistic strategy modifies the aluminum current collector to enhance potassiophilicity, increase nucleation density and induce 3D progressive nucleation mode, thereby ensuring a dendrite&#8208;free potassium anode toward robust potassium metal batteries.








Abstract
The tailored nucleation and growth of potassium metal over a current collector is essential to realize longevous potassium metal anodes. The commercial current collector lacks sufficient nucleation sites and fails to guide uniform deposition, underscoring the request for interfacial modulation maneuvers. Herein, we develop transition metal atom&#8211;cluster moiety decorated N&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanosphere to modify the Al current collector. In a Fe model system, the Fe single atoms provide high surface energy and fast charge transfer, while Fe clusters serve as local electron reservoirs. This cooperative architecture manages to tune the d&#8208;band center, accordingly promoting the potassium capture and minimizing the nucleation overpotential to merely 4&#160;mV. Theoretical simulations and in situ microscopic/spectroscopic characterizations evidence that the synergistic modification markedly accelerates potassium plating/stripping kinetics, enabling prolonged symmetric&#8208;cell cycling (approaching 3000&#160;h) and stabilized full&#8208;cell performance (0.022% decay rate per cycle over 2000 cycles). This strategy could be extended to other transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, or Cu), offering a paradigm for atomic&#8208;level interfacial engineering toward reversible alkali metal batteries.

Herein, a series of highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence films were achieved by doping heterocyclic molecules containing a chiral propionic acid group into a polymer matrix, with the highest phosphorescence efficiency reaching up to 68.4% under ambient conditions. Notably, the chiral propionic acid group not only imparts circular polarization to the emitter but also enhances intermolecular interactions between the host and emitter.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with circularly polarization feature attracts considerable attentions owing to its unique exciton and photon properties. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a series of CPP films by doping heterocyclic molecules with a chiral propionic acid group into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, achieving a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 68.4% under ambient conditions. The intermolecular interactions between the chiral isolated molecules and PVA simultaneously induce circularly polarized luminescence and enhance phosphorescence efficiency, thereby improving CPP performance. Moreover, the CPP lifetimes of the films can be rationally tuned from 1 to 944&#160;ms by subtle modification of heteroatoms on the heterocyclic chromophores. This study provides a promising approach to developing efficient CPP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics and bioelectronics.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Activity of Cu4 Clusters Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a tetranuclear copper cluster as a model, we modulated coordination microenvironments to boost electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance, uncovering atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity correlations and offering precise ligand&#8208;engineering strategies for advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Surface ligands play a crucial role in modifying catalytic environments and enhancing performance through various mechanisms. However, the multivariate synergistic mechanisms, dynamic evolution patterns, and universal design principles of ligand effects remain to be thoroughly investigated. Metal clusters, with their atomically precise structures, serve as ideal models for studying ligand regulation mechanisms. Herein, we synthesized two copper clusters of N,S&#8208;bidentate ligand&#8208;protected Cu4(PTI)4 and Cu4(BTT)4 featuring identical metallic core structures but distinct ligand architectures and evaluated their catalytic performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Notably, the Cu4(PTI)4 cluster with stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands achieved near&#8208;100% Faradaic efficiency at optimal potentials, significantly surpassing the Cu4(BTT)4. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we unveiled that enhancing the electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of ligands induces alterations in the local microenvironment and electronic structure of metal active sites, thereby exerting positive impacts on electrocatalytic NO3RR performance.

         <title>Transforming Single&#8208;Atom Site to Dual&#8208;Atom Site in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts: A Universal Strategy for Enhancing Durability in Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>

This work develops a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits highly active, selective, and strong H2O2 decomposition capability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. 








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising non&#8208;noble metal oxygen reduction catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, their practical applications are still limited by unsatisfactory long&#8208;term stability. This is because the N atoms of the active FeN4 moiety are easy to protonate, leading to the leaching of Fe atoms, and the H2O2 generated during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process triggers the Fenton reaction, further accelerating the dissolution of Fe. To address these critical stability challenge, we developed a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. This is achieved by treating the presynthesized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in a H2/Ar atmosphere to break the C&#9472;N bonds near the FeN4 sites while introducing Fe and N precursors to form the Fe2N6 sites. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the newly formed Fe2N6 sites are structurally more stable in acidic ORR and produce negligible H2O2 (&lt;1%). Therefore, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits an extremely low Fe demetalation ratio (0.61 at%) in 0.1&#160;M HClO4 after 80k cycling. More surprisingly, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst can effectively decompose H2O2 with a high decomposition rate of 15.7&#160;mmol min&#8722;1, approaching that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Pt/C catalyst (17&#160;mmol min&#8722;1). As a result, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst assembled PEMFC operates stably for 300&#160;h with only 7% current density attenuation, whereas that of the pristine Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst&#8208;based device declines by 84% within 100&#160;h.

         <title>Coherently Coupled Frustrated Lewis Pairs in In2O3&#8722;x Nanoclusters for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) were constructed on the graphitic carbon nitride support, leveraging the privileged hydrogen&#8208;bond sewing interface. Significantly, the built&#8208;in electric fields and particularly multisite architecture reshape the kinetic landscapes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The downstream reduction follows the formate pathway, which preferentially inhibits CO production while promotes CH4 formation. 








Abstract
Co&#8208;catalysts integration presents unique opportunities to enhance photoactivity, yet selectivity control and mechanistic understanding within multistep reactions remain fundamental challenges hitherto. In this study, a reshaped kinetic landscape is demonstrated over coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on carbon nitride matrix, which mediates directed CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion with a selectivity of 65.3% (electron basis). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded interface fosters intimate electronic coupling, generating built&#8208;in electric fields that facilitate cascade charge transfer processes. Particularly, exceptionally robust FLPs sites were identified within the sub&#8208;nanosized In2O3&#8722;x nanoclusters, in contrast to easily deactivated counterparts in oversized crystalline structures. These enduring FLPs sites confer privileged adaptive binding with CO2 and mutative C1 intermediates. Correlated in situ infrared and mass spectroscopic analyses track the formation of FLPs&#8208;CO2 adducts and highlight the predominance of formate (HCOO&#8722;) pathway, surpassing competitive CO evolution. This work opens inspiring prospects for exploring multielectron photochemistry and achievable metrics through distinctive FLPs topologies on sub&#8208;nanostructures.

         <title>Improving Mass Transport and Charge Transfer in COF&#8208;Based Photocatalysts With Three&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Macropores for Benzylamine Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy enables the synthesis of 3DOM&#8208;COFs with ordered macropores. Coupled with ZnCdS, the resulting S&#8208;scheme heterojunction efficiently catalyzes benzylamine oxidation and H&#8322; evolution. The 3DOM structure accelerates mass transfer and charge transfer, enhancing overall photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown promise as photocatalysts for chemical transformations. However, their dense micropores and poor pore connectivity hinder mass transport and charge separation/transfer, limiting their efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;A one-step self-sacrificing template strategy enables the synthesis of 3DOM-COFs with ordered macropores. Coupled with ZnCdS, the resulting S-scheme heterojunction efficiently catalyzes benzylamine oxidation and H&#8322; evolution. The 3DOM structure accelerates mass transfer and charge transfer, enhancing overall photocatalytic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown promise as photocatalysts for chemical transformations. However, their dense micropores and poor pore connectivity hinder mass transport and charge separation/transfer, limiting their efficiency. Herein, we develop a one-step self-sacrificing template strategy to synthesize three-dimensional ordered macroporous COFs (3DOM-COFs). This approach uniquely integrates in situ Tp&#8211;Tta COF crystallization with synchronized degradation of polystyrene templates under solvothermal conditions. This method introduces unreported kinetic match between template decomposition and framework growth. Such a confined growth mechanism leads to structurally robust and highly ordered macroporosity without post-processing. 3DOM architecture enables uniform dispersion of fine ZnCdS nanoparticles for the generation a 3DOM-COF based S-scheme heterojunction, which exhibits remarkable performance in the oxidation of benzylamine (BA) for simultaneous N-benzylbenzaldimine production with 99% selectivity at a rate of 15.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation with a rate of 17.8&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The 3DOM architecture confers 50-fold faster mass transport than bulk COFs, while the heterojunction facilitates directional charge separation and interface charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the heterojunction optimizes reaction thermodynamics by lowering the potential energy barriers of BA activation. The work pioneers a template-concurrent synthesis paradigm, resolving COFs' critical pore engineering challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging One&#8208; and Multi&#8208;Photon Processes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Enhanced NIR Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal and Photochemical Conversions</title>

This work demonstrates a paradigm for the development of highly stable and multifunctional HOF materials to enable the full&#8208;spectrum utilization of sunlight, which is achieved through a dual&#8208;process mechanism involving one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitations, facilitated by direct absorption of NIR light within a single HOF platform, for synergistically enhanced performance in photothermal, photochemical, and chiroptical applications.








Abstract
Direct application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for solar&#8208;thermal and solar&#8208;chemical conversions is of emergent interest to improving efficiency in solar&#8208;energy utilization. Herein, we report a synthetic approach to NIR&#8208;responsive materials by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;1/2/3) from multifunctionalized Ru&#8208;components incorporating chiral, photoactive, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;stacking, and protonation/deprotonation subunits. Significantly, protonation of the imidazole&#8208;subunits in HOF&#8208;3 promotes densified packing to extend NIR absorption tail up to 1100&#160;nm with a narrowed bandgap of 1.41&#160;eV, meanwhile leads to spontaneous resolution of enantiomeric &#916;&#8208;/&#923;&#8208;HOF&#8208;3. Consequently, remarkably enhanced photothermal effect and photocatalytic performance, including chiroptical activity induced by circularly polarized NIR light, are achieved through synergy of direct one&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon NIR absorption, underscoring effectiveness to bring multifunctionalities into ordered HOFs for generation of robust and effective materials with multimode NIR responsiveness.

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;based Multiblock Copolymers from Cascade ROMP&#8208;RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ROMP&#8208;RAFT cascade polymerization strategy was designed to synthesize polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers, which were employed as compatibilizers to upcycle mixed plastics.








Abstract
Plastic disposal has become a serious environmental and social problem. Mechanical recycling of waste plastics is the most widely adopted strategy to address this issue, but if used to recycle mixed plastics, it usually requires the addition of amphiphilic block copolymers. Polyolefins account for almost half of all synthetic plastics, making them ubiquitous in the plastic waste stream. Within this perspective, polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers are highly desirable, but they are difficult to access using traditional strategies. In this contribution, a cascade ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization strategy was developed to prepare various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with tunable polar segments and microstructures. Using this strategy, tunable amounts of the trithiocarbonate RAFT agents were installed in the polyolefin main chain via ROMP. Subsequent chain extension of various polar vinyl monomers via controlled RAFT polymerization formed various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with high molecular weight and good physical properties. These multiblock copolymers were used to compatibilize and upcycle mixtures of high&#8208;density polyethylene/polymethyl methacrylate (HDPE/PMMA) and high&#8208;density polyethylene/polyethylene terephthalate (HDPE/PET).

A butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent molecular tracker is designed to make dynamic polymerization processes visible and colorful. In their Research Article (e202507770), Qi Zhang and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of a conformationally flipping fluorescent dye that senses subtle microenvironmental changes and emits multicolor fluorescence to visualize the dynamics in reversible polymerization of cyclic disulfides. This molecular optical tool enables a real&#8208;time and sensitive way to monitor polymeric systems.

Native proteins are typically not cell&#8208;permeable, making intracellular delivery a significant challenge. The cover image illustrates the model protein RNase A, which is transiently modified with polyarginine chains (orange) attached to lysine residues. In combination with the CPP&#8208;Additive technology, the resulting bioconjugate is able to translocate across the lipid membrane of human cells. Details are reported in the Research Article (e202506802) by Christian Hackenberger et&#160;al.

         <title>Anisotropy of Single&#8208;Crystal Semiconductors in Photo(electro)Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes how crystallographic anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors governs light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions, offering mechanistic insights and design guidelines for high&#8208;performance photo(electro)catalysts through material synthesis, theoretical modeling, and advanced characterization techniques.








Abstract
Anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors has emerged as a key design principle for understanding and advancing photo(electro)catalytic systems. The exposure of well&#8208;defined facets in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors introduces anisotropic variations in atomic coordination, electronic structure, and surface energetics, giving rise to directional charge transport and facet&#8208;specific reactivity. Such intrinsic differences coordinate the entire photocatalytic process, from charge excitation and separation to interfacial reaction kinetics. In this regard, effective utilization of anisotropy requires clarifying its impact on electronic structure, charge transport, and interfacial reactivity, along with its sensitivity to microenvironmental changes under realistic operando conditions. In this review article, we systematically examine the role of crystallographic anisotropy in light harvesting, charge carrier dynamics, and surface reactivity. We summarize recent advances in anisotropic material design, trace the evolution of the concept, and provide mechanistic insights based on experimental studies, theoretical models, and advanced characterization techniques. We further discuss current challenges and propose strategies to guide the rational application of anisotropy in catalyst design, aiming to expand its scope across a broader range of photo(electro)catalytic systems.

         <title>Rational Design Strategies in DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in rational DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) design, focusing on fragment&#8208;based DELs, covalent DELs, and focused DELs. These innovations shift DELs from empirical screening to a more strategic, hypothesis&#8208;driven approach, enhancing hit quality and drug discovery efficiency.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have emerged as a powerful and cost&#8208;effective platform for high&#8208;throughput screening, enabling the rapid identification of small&#8208;molecule ligands against a wide range of biological targets. However, traditional DEL approaches often rely on empirical and broad&#8208;based library construction, which can lead to low hit rates, off&#8208;target interactions, and limited chemical diversity around pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Recent technological advances have sought to address these limitations, shifting DELs from a largely blind screening tool to a more rational and precision&#8208;oriented strategy. In this review, we systematically examine the evolution of DEL methodologies, with a particular focus on innovations in library design that enhance hit quality and screening efficiency. Specifically, we highlight the emergence of fragment&#8208;based DEL strategies for exploring chemical space with minimal structures, the incorporation of covalent warheads to enable irreversible binding to specific residues, and the development of focused DELs tailored to particular protein families or binding motifs. Together, these advances mark a shift from blind, empirical screening toward a more strategic and hypothesis&#8208;driven application of DEL technology.

         <title>Embracing Complexity: Peptides as Tunable Scaffolds in the Construction of Discrete Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent chirality, tunability, biocompatibility, and robustness of peptides provide an exciting opportunity for supramolecular chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore uses of peptides in discrete supramolecular systems, how chemists can draw inspiration from larger biological assemblies, and discuss how embracing the complexity of peptide secondary structures in the design of these systems provides opportunities for novel structures and functions.








Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has advanced rapidly, with scientists using fundamental understanding to generate function from simple building blocks. However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function, introducing chiral, information&#8208;rich building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of oxygen&#8208;doped graphene nanoribbons (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR) were synthesized on Au(111) via in situ formation of pyrans. Both O&#8208;doped GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors but exhibit different sensitivities to oxygen dopants, which is attributed to the difference in the density of states near the Fermi level between the substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts.








Abstract
Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.

         <title>Encapsulating Ionophores in Zeolite Imidazolate Framework&#8208;8 for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Ion Fluctuations in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, ionophore was encapsulated in zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticle for long&#8208;term ion recognition with high stability. The mechanical mismatch between implanted electrodes and brain tissue was addressed by sputtering gold nanoparticles (AuNP) on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers as a flexible electrode substrate. This study provides a versatile strategy for developing ion&#8208;selective microsensors that well meet the demands of long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring.








Abstract
Various ions in the brain (e.g., H+, K+, and Ca2+) play essential roles in neural information transmission and physiopathological processes. Real&#8208;time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long&#8208;term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion&#8208;selective microsensor for long&#8208;term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long&#8208;term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer&#8208;based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.

We introduce an all&#8208;in&#8208;one AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA platform, a novel, rapid, and automated method for absolute quantitation of influenza A and B viruses. This digital microfluidics&#8208;based approach completes the entire workflow from sample preparation to digital read&#8208;out within 60&#160; minutes.








Abstract
Accurate nucleic acid quantification analysis (NQA) is crucial for disease treatment and prevention. However, existing digital NQA methods often lack sufficient automation and speed. In this study, we introduce a novel rapid and automated active&#8208;matrix digital microfluidics&#8208;based droplet digital recombinase polymerase amplification method (AM&#8208;DMF&#8208;ddRPA). This method can quantify influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) within a mere 60&#160;min, covering the entire workflow from nucleic acid extraction to digital amplification, fluorescence detection, and statistical analysis. We fabricated an AM&#8208;DMF chip equipped with high&#8208;throughput electrodes and optimized its control logic. Leveraging an artificial intelligence droplet navigation algorithm, we successfully achieved motion and mixing operations of high&#8208;throughput droplets (4608 droplets, each with a volume of 0.9&#160;nL). A dual&#8208;target RPA system was designed to detect IAV and IBV, and its detection performance was fine&#8208;tuned. Experiments conducted with clinical samples revealed that this method exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity for single&#8208;molecule detection, with a detection limit of 1.69 copies per reaction, and it achieved 100% concordance with qPCR results. This groundbreaking quantification technology holds tremendous promise for advancing disease diagnosis, treatment, and fundamental research.

         <title>Multiactivity of Nanozyme Liposome Regulates the Homeostasis of Biochemical Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biomimetic liposome (CeO2@M) with nanozyme multiactivity to regulate the homeostasis of microenvironment. Artificial liposomes with negatively charged liposomes, like endothelial membranes, reduce blood component adhesion. The CeO2 nanozyme hydrolyzes ATP/ADP, lessening platelet aggregation, and regulates the level of biochemical factors such as ROS to maintain the homeostasis of the microenvironment for tissue regeneration.








Abstract
In living systems, cascade reactions involving multiple enzymes, critical for regulating the biochemical microenvironment's homeostasis, are essential to transplantation remodeling. However, for ready&#8208;to&#8208;use purposes, designing and constructing therapeutic liposomes that replicate natural cell functions during the initial transplantation phase remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology for tissue engineering. Herein, we developed a biomimetic liposome with multienzymatic nanozyme activity to regulate proinflammatory factors induced by exogenous implants. The liposomes were fabricated through the self&#8208;assembly of artificial membranes on CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). These membranes, featuring a negatively charged surface analogous to endothelial cell (EC) membranes, effectively attenuate blood component adhesion and aggregation. The CeO2 nanozyme not only hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), reducing subsequent platelet aggregation, but also regulates biochemical microenvironment homeostasis, thereby promoting tissue regeneration. This work advances the development of cell&#8208;like entities capable of modulating signaling communication between living and abiotic interfaces.

         <title>First Chiral Catalan Solid Based on Molybdenum Halide with Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Deep&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra was successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. This unique Catalan solid structure exhibits efficient deep&#8208;red circularly polarized emission, enhanced stability, and improved photoluminescence quantum yield. The proposed system provides a novel platform for advancing the research on chiral metal halides and paves the way for their application toward chiral optoelectronics. 








Abstract
The design of novel chiral metal halides with exceptional chiroptical properties has attracted significant research attention due to their potential applications in chiral optoelectronics and spintronics. However, developing the deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters is still challenging. In this work, we presented the first chiral molybdenum halide clusters by incorporating chiral methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA) for the design of (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra, which adopt the unique Catalan solid structure. These chiral tetrakis hexahedra exhibit 24 unique 3c&#8208;2e Mo&#9472;Mo&#9472;Cl bonds, which are scarcely reported. Notably, these (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra demonstrated pronounced circularly polarized luminescence in the deep&#8208;red region, accompanied by an extended emission lifetime of 114.14 &#181;s at room temperature. Additionally, these chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra are optically stable for 3 months. The four&#8208;state spin sublevel model was employed to investigate the emission mechanism and found that the temperature&#8208;dependent exciton dynamics lead to the dual&#8208;band emission of the designed chiral tetrakis hexahedra.

     alt="First Chiral Catalan Solid Based on Molybdenum Halide with Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Deep-Red Region"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra was successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. This unique Catalan solid structure exhibits efficient deep-red circularly polarized emission, enhanced stability, and improved photoluminescence quantum yield. The proposed system provides a novel platform for advancing the research on chiral metal halides and paves the way for their application toward chiral optoelectronics. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of novel chiral metal halides with exceptional chiroptical properties has attracted significant research attention due to their potential applications in chiral optoelectronics and spintronics. However, developing the deep-red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters is still challenging. In this work, we presented the first chiral molybdenum halide clusters by incorporating chiral methylbenzylammonium (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MBA) for the design of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; tetrakis hexahedra, which adopt the unique Catalan solid structure. These chiral tetrakis hexahedra exhibit 24 unique 3&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-2&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; Mo&#9472;Mo&#9472;Cl bonds, which are scarcely reported. Notably, these (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; tetrakis hexahedra demonstrated pronounced circularly polarized luminescence in the deep-red region, accompanied by an extended emission lifetime of 114.14 &#181;s at room temperature. Additionally, these chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra are optically stable for 3 months. The four-state spin sublevel model was employed to investigate the emission mechanism and found that the temperature-dependent exciton dynamics lead to the dual-band emission of the designed chiral tetrakis hexahedra. Our study expands the family of lead-free chiral metal halides and develops a novel strategy to design a high-performance deep-red CPL emitter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiodivergent Photocatalytic Annulation for the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent photocatalytic annulation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea with olefins or bicyclobutanes (BCBs) has been developed. The regioselectivity is controlled by the proper choice of counteranion of the cationic iridium photocatalyst and solvent. This protocol enables straightforward access to diverse cyclic amino hydrocarbons, including functionalized bicyclic scaffolds of distinct three&#8208;dimensional architectures, with precise deployment of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene groups, cultivating a chemical space for bioisosteres.








Abstract
Regiodivergent synthesis is a powerful strategy for expanding chemical space. Given the significance of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules in pharmaceutical sciences, a regiodivergent [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea to olefins and [1.1.0]&#8208;bicyclobutanes was developed by employing cationic iridium complexes as photocatalysts under visible&#8208;light irradiation. By properly selecting a counteranion of the photocatalyst and tuning the reaction conditions, each regioisomeric cyclic hydrocarbon with a defined gem&#8208;difluoromethylene disposition was directly assembled with high selectivity. Mechanistic elucidation revealed the critical relevance of the basicity of the photocatalyst counteranion to the regiochemical outcome. The reaction diverges depending on the intervention of deprotonation of the initially generated urea radical cation by the pairing anion to form the corresponding neutral radical; this not only governs the regioselective ring opening of the cyclopropane moiety but also modulates the relative reactivity of the two resulting terminal carbon radicals, thereby dictating the dominant pathway.

         <title>Selective Phosphorylation of Phenols and Benzenediols by the Kinase PsiK and Variants Thereof</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PsiK from Psilocybe cubensis phosphorylates a diverse set of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate. High&#8208;throughput screening of active site mutant libraries using DESI&#8208;MS enabled protein engineering of PsiK, further expanding its substrate scope. The scalability of PsiK&#8208;catalyzed reactions was demonstrated, further highlighting its biocatalytic utility for selective phosphorylation.








Abstract
Phosphorylation plays important roles in biology by modulating the structure, reactivity, and biological function of a broad range of molecules. Biocatalytic phosphorylation has attracted attention from synthetic chemists due to its selectivity and mild reaction conditions using ATP as a phosphate donor. Given the potential synthetic utility of kinases with activity on small molecule substrates, we explored the activity of PsiK, the enzyme responsible for selective 4&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylation of 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine or psilocin in psylocybin biosynthesis by Psilocybe cubensis. We find that PsiK has good activity on a range of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate, enabling preparative phosphorylation of different substrates, and substantially expands the substrate scope of biocatalytic phosphorylation. We also show that active site mutations can further expand substrate scope and improve site&#8208;selectivity. This engineering effort was greatly expedited using DESI&#8208;MS screening, which enabled analysis of 2688 reactions in only 40&#160;min. Finally, gram&#8208;scale phosphorylation of a representative substrate was achieved with a turnover number over 10 000. Together, these results highlight the biocatalytic utility of PsiK and derivatives thereof for selective phosphorylation of phenols and benzenediols under mild conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Cathode Constructed Solely by Carbon Dots for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>

Carbon dots are solely applied as the active cathode material in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries for the first time, which exhibit decent cycling performance, excellent capacity retention, and ultrahigh ion diffusion ability.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have been explored widely in the electrochemistry field, owing to their unique structures and rich properties. However, in the reported devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, CDs are always used as additives to modify the electrodes or regulate the electrolytes because they have been regarded as inert and low&#8208;capacity materials all along. Here, for the first time, o&#8208;phenylenediamine derived CDs are selected as the only protagonist to construct cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such CDs (p&#8208;CDs) have a special &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenazine&#8208;based structure, with carbon cores for electrical conductivity and active sites for embedding Zn2+ and H+. The p&#8208;CDs solely constructed cathode material delivers a superior capacity of 290&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and a decent capacity of 103&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 10&#160;A g&#8722;1, as well as an ultrahigh ion diffusion coefficient of 10&#8722;8&#160;&#8764;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;cm2 s&#8722;1. The p&#8208;CDs assembled ZIBs exhibit a stable long&#8208;term cycling, retaining 87.4% of the original capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles. Various characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the electron&#8208;deficient N as the active sites on p&#8208;CDs can embed/release Zn2+ and H+ reversibly.

         <title>Building a Bridge Between Ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS by Non&#8208;Exhaustive Microdesorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential analysis strategy was developed to integrate rapid ambient mass spectrometry (MS) screening with LC&#8208;MS confirmation using a single solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) device. The approach involves an initial non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption for ambient MS screening, followed by a second desorption for LC&#8208;MS confirmation of only the disputed samples. This workflow enhances throughput while maintaining sensitivity and minimizing matrix effects. The method has been applied for high throughput anti&#8208;doping test.








Abstract
Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) offers rapid screening but faces challenges in analyzing complex samples due to high matrix effects. The absence of a separation step can also lead to false positives due to the isomers or isobars. In this study, a sequential analysis strategy which combines ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS based on the non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption in solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) was developed for the first time. By combining coated blade spray (CBS)&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS, in the first step, a few microliters of solvent were used for non&#8208;exhaustive desorption with high enrichment factor for rapid screening by CBS&#8208;MS. For the suspicious samples, the remaining analytes on the SPME coating undergo exhaustive desorption, then followed by LC&#8208;MS confirmation. The matrix&#8208;compatible coating used in the SPME device significantly reduces matrix effects while enhancing sensitivity through analyte enrichment. This method is environmentally friendly, utilizing only a few microliters of organic solvents for screening. The approach was rigorously validated, both theoretically and experimentally, and successfully applied to anti&#8208;doping testing, enabling detection of 53 prohibited substances in urine samples by integrating CBS&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS.

This workflow enhances throughput while maintaining sensitivity and minimizing matrix effects. The method has been applied for high throughput anti-doping test.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) offers rapid screening but faces challenges in analyzing complex samples due to high matrix effects. The absence of a separation step can also lead to false positives due to the isomers or isobars. In this study, a sequential analysis strategy which combines ambient MS and LC-MS based on the non-exhaustive microdesorption in solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was developed for the first time. By combining coated blade spray (CBS)-MS with LC-MS, in the first step, a few microliters of solvent were used for non-exhaustive desorption with high enrichment factor for rapid screening by CBS-MS. For the suspicious samples, the remaining analytes on the SPME coating undergo exhaustive desorption, then followed by LC-MS confirmation. The matrix-compatible coating used in the SPME device significantly reduces matrix effects while enhancing sensitivity through analyte enrichment. This method is environmentally friendly, utilizing only a few microliters of organic solvents for screening. The approach was rigorously validated, both theoretically and experimentally, and successfully applied to anti-doping testing, enabling detection of 53 prohibited substances in urine samples by integrating CBS-MS with LC-MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Molecular Engineering of Heptamethine Cyanine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Type&#8208;I Photosensitizers for Pro&#8208;Death Autophagy and Hypoxia&#8208;Tolerant Antitumor Treatment</title>

This study presents precise molecular engineering for conversion of typical heptamethine cyanine dye into a good type&#8208;I photosensitizer. The optimized molecular can produce hydroxyl radicals by electron transfer and alkyl radicals by H&#8208;abstraction reaction. These radicals can induce ferroptosis and necroptosis, providing a crucial strategy for hypoxic solid tumors therapy. 








Abstract
Heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) dyes have excellent near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging capability but competitively inhibit the photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect, especially in hypoxic solid tumors. In this study, a series of aryl&#8208;ketone&#8208;modified Cy7 derivatives (ACy) were constructed to transform Cy7 into a type&#8208;I photosensitizer capable of both hydrogen (H)&#8208;abstraction and electron transfer for the first time. The introduction of an aryl&#8208;ketone group at the C3 position of Cy7 imparted it with H&#8208;abstraction capability and enhanced its intersystem crossing efficiency. Moreover, an increase in the steric hindrance of the aryl&#8208;ketone group promoted the efficiency of the H&#8208;abstraction reaction and electron transfer process. Optimized molecules, 3ACy&#8208;3ipr, not only exhibited bright fluorescence but also generated hydroxyl and alkyl radicals upon NIR light irradiation. These radicals induced mitochondrial autophagy in hypoxic tumor cells, eventually leading to necrosis and ferroptosis. Tumor targeting peptide modified liposomes were used to construct nanocarriers to improve the biocompatibility and tumor retention of 3ACy&#8208;3ipr, which fluoresces at the tumor site and significantly inhibited the growth of solid tumors via PDT. This study provides an excellent platform for the precise development and clinical utilization of NIR theranostic agents.

         <title>Regioselective C&#9472;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>

H3CP contributes to sustainable synthesis by integrating regioselective enzymatic halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, and enzymatic hydrolysis. TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M micelles enable the Pd&#8208;catalyzed step, allowing seamless compatibility with enzymatic reactions in one vessel under aqueous conditions. Using this platform, diverse simple aromatic substrates are readily transformed into valuable acrylic acid building blocks.








Abstract
The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform&#160;=&#160;H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.

         <title>Sustainable Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Polyester Waste Using Reconstructed Defective&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical recycling of polyester waste is a sustainable circular economy strategy. Here, we report a strategy for closed&#8208;loop recycling of polyester waste catalyzed by a reconstructed defective&#8208;MOF (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) under mild conditions. The sustainability assessment results verify the ecological, resource, and health advantages of closed&#8208;loop recycling as well as the feasibility of the circular economy.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of polyester waste presents a promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular economy. However, the development of efficient, low&#8208;cost recycling methods that minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions remains challenging. Here, we report an approach for depolymerization polyester waste to bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) using a reconstructed metal&#8211;organic framework (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) catalyst under mild conditions. The r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT exhibited a space&#8208;time yield of 1035.8 gBHET gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 190&#160;&#176;C. Importantly, this is an order of magnitude higher than that reported for similar MOF&#8208;based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the depolymerization pathway involves the activation of oxygen and ethylene glycol adsorbed on r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT, forming nucleophilic intermediates. These intermediates then facilitate the cleavage of the polyester C&#9472;O bond through nucleophilic attack, thereby gradually generating the BHET product. Sustainability evaluation results validated the circular economy feasibility of the recycling approach, with a minimum sales price (MSP) of 498 $/ton, much lower than the MSP of the traditional petroleum&#8208;based production route (1000 $/ton). The approach also achieved a 61% reduction in energy use and a 52% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a sustainable solution for managing polyester waste accumulation.

A dynamic crystalline bio&#8208;based nanofiber membrane is constructed via a rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular network strategy. The nanofiber membrane exhibits a three&#8208;stage fracture mechanism during the stress process. demonstrating exceptional mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based polyurethanes are promising sustainable elastomers whose polymeric network structure has a decisive impact on their properties. However, existing bio&#8208;based polyurethanes face challenges in simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and toughness. Inspired by the multilevel heterogeneous structure of articular cartilage, we propose a bionic design strategy of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled supramolecular cross&#8208;linking networks to prepare bio&#8208;based polyurethane elastomers with enhanced strength and toughness. By incorporating the asymmetric coupling of rigid furan rings and flexible aliphatic side chains into the molecular chains, a dynamic hydrogen bond network with a gradient distribution of bond energy was constructed, achieving uniform microphase separation between the soft phase (amorphous) and the hard phase (crystalline). Nanofiber membranes were fabricated by rigid&#8208;flexible coupled polyurethane electrospinning, where the microphase&#8208;separated structure is further transformed into dynamic crystalline domains. Under external force, multilevel energy dissipation is achieved through the breaking and controllable recombination of hydrogen bonds within the crystalline domain. resulting in polyurethane nanofiber membranes with significantly enhanced mechanical strength and toughness (fracture strength: 31.37&#160;MPa, fracture strain: 731.04%, toughness: 102.13&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). This network design strategy expands the potential of bio&#8208;based elastomers in smart wearable textiles, flexible electronic devices, and biomedical applications, thereby advancing the development of sustainable high&#8208;performance polymers.

Under external force, multilevel energy dissipation is achieved through the breaking and controllable recombination of hydrogen bonds within the crystalline domain. resulting in polyurethane nanofiber membranes with significantly enhanced mechanical strength and toughness (fracture strength: 31.37&#160;MPa, fracture strain: 731.04%, toughness: 102.13&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). This network design strategy expands the potential of bio-based elastomers in smart wearable textiles, flexible electronic devices, and biomedical applications, thereby advancing the development of sustainable high-performance polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Electrocatalytic Glycerol Upgrading to Glyceraldehyde in Near Neutral Media by Cobalt Oxide Lattice Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism is proposed by introducing Ru single atom into the Co tetrahedral (CoTd) site, which switches the rate determining step (RDS)&#160;from reconstruction to adsorbed electrophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (AOM&#8208;HAT) process and resultantly enhancing both glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) activity and glyceraldehyde (GAD) selectivity in neutral media.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol driven by renewable electricity offers a greatly attractive green way to produce value&#8208;added chemicals at much reduced global carbon footprint. However, achieving both the enhanced activity and selectivity for the most&#8208;valuable C3 product&#8208;glyceraldehyde (GAD) of glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in neutral media, though of great importance, is extremely challenging. In this work, we propose a Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism by introducing single atom Ru (0.36&#160;wt%) into the tetrahedral sites (CoTd) of Co3O4 lattice to significantly elevate the GOR activity and the GAD selectivity. The as&#8208;constructed Ru&#8208;Co3O4/NF only needs 1.16&#160;V to achieve the current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 during GOR and maintains &#8764;60% GAD selectivity (&#8764;90% for C3 products) over a broad potential window, which are the highest reported in near neutral media. This excellent performance has been demonstrated to originate from the introduction of Ru atoms, which activates the lattice active sites of Co3O4 by promoting the rapid reconstruction of the catalyst to generate sufficient Co3+&#8208;(OH)ads electrophilic oxygen species, resulting in not only the accelerated GOR kinetics, also largely enhanced selectivity of GAD by the adsorption configuration regulation of glycerol primary alcohols (C&#945;&#8208;OH) favoring the primary alcohol oxidation pathway.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Mediated Luminophore Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The choice of anion selectively directs the solution&#8208;state aggregation of a cationic luminophore, dictating its photoluminescence. Some anions cause emission from a monomeric state, some induce excimer formation, and others lead to dimers, while the triflate counterion gives multichromatic emission from all three species.








Abstract
Emissive organic salts have long been integral to the discovery of fluorescence phenomena and functional luminescent dyes. Typically, one component of the salt acts as the photoactive unit (luminophore) and its nonemissive counterion is selected to independently tune bulk physical properties, such as solubility. However, the impact of counterion choice on the aggregation and resulting emissive state of organic salts in solution has not been widely investigated. Here, we report that a single cationic luminophore gives rise to either monomer, dimer, excimer, or multichromatic emission under otherwise identical conditions by varying only its counterion. We employ N&#8208;methyl quininium (MeQn+) as a permanently charged cationic luminophore, which we pair with a series of monovalent anions. At low solution&#8208;state concentrations, all the salts give identical absorption and emission spectra that correlate with the MeQn+ monomer. However, at higher concentrations, the emission, excitation, and absorption data differ, revealing the presence of monomer, dimer, excimer, or all three, depending on the structure of the anion. Understanding and modulating the formation of dimeric or other well&#8208;defined aggregated species by specific ion effects could be exploited in the design of molecular probes for biological systems or emissive thin&#8208;film dispersions for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Orchestrating Penta&#8208;Element Interplay in Gradient&#8208;Porous Carbons for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between the active sites induced by promete and the Na+ storage capacity as well as anion adsorption/desorption has been established through a combination of electrochemical analysis, machine learning potentials, and molecular dynamics simulations, which enhances the kinetics and capacity balance of anode and cathode for sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) offer a cutting&#8208;edge synergy between battery&#8208;level energy density and supercapacitor&#8208;like power density, yet face critical challenges in balancing the kinetic and capacity mismatch between Faradaic anodes and capacitive cathodes. Herein, we present a penta&#8208;element doped gradient&#8208;porous carbon (PE&#8208;GPC) with a nanosphere architecture, engineered with high&#8208;entropy principles and a gradual pore density variation to enhance mass transport and charge storage. Operando spectroscopy and machine learning potentials unveil a concerted penta&#8208;element interplay: thiophene&#8208;like S configurations mediate dynamic redox processes, enabling pseudocapacitive Na&#8314; and anion storage, while fluorine functionalities foster a self&#8208;rejuvenating NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), stabilizing long&#8208;term cycling. Meanwhile, the synergistic N/B/P triad engineers a hierarchical defect network that enhances electronic conductivity and fine&#8208;tunes ion adsorption energetics. This orchestrated interplay empowers the SIHC full cell with a high energy density of 196&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a formidable power density (10.4&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1), and an impressive 88.2% capacity retention after 9000 cycles. By establishing a high&#8208;entropy stabilization paradigm, this work paves the way for multi&#8208;ion storage architectures, offering a universal strategy to bridge the charge&#8208;transfer imbalance in advanced energy devices.

         <title>Branched&#8208;Selective Functionalization of 2&#8208;Alkyl Aziridines Through Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl aziridines was reported, enabling unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling and defluorinative coupling via cleavage of the more hindered and less favored C&#9472;N bond. This strategy also enables a novel remote desaturation reaction of aziridines through a unique &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process. This work offers a modular approach to different alkenyl amine derivatives.








Abstract
Overriding the inherent substrate&#8208;controlled regioselectivity in aziridine activation holds significant potential. It could enable previously inaccessible disconnections from these readily available, strained heterocycles, facilitating the diverse synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing products. In this study, we present a Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl (and 2,2&#8208;dialkyl) aziridines, leading to unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling with styrenes and reductive defluorinative coupling with trifluoromethyl alkenes. In addition to enabling the functionalization of the N&#8208;adjacent sites of aziridines, this catalyst&#8208;controlled activation strategy triggers an unprecedented reaction framework for aziridines, namely, the remote desaturation via ring&#8208;opening. Notably, detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate the operation of a rare &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process, offering a flexible method for remote desaturation that generates alkenyl amines with varying chain lengths. Overall, this study provides a modular approach to access a wide range of alkenyl amine derivatives.

Zwitterionic pnictinidenes: A new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species stabilized by bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate ligands is reported, enabling the isolation of Sb and Bi in multiple oxidation states. These thoroughly characterized systems exhibit cationic character and engage in redox catalysis, facilitating catalytic hydrodefluorination and dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes, expanding the scope of main group redox chemistry.








Abstract
Herein, we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low&#8208;valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.

         <title>Highly Crystalline and Oriented Thin Films of Fully Conjugated 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a fully conjugated, 3D covalent organic framework (COF) based on cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh); the synthesis employs modulated conditions to achieve thin films with high crystallinity. The COTh&#8208;1P COF shows potential for optoelectronic applications, thanks to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, the preferential film orientation, and charge dynamics insights obtained from optical pump terahertz probe studies.








Abstract
Fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp3&#8208;connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs. We report on a novel COTh building block, featuring functional formyl groups directly attached to the core's conjugated thiophenes. The modulation synthesis approach with mono&#8208;functionalized inhibitors enables the formation of COTh&#8208;1P COF, which exhibited remarkable crystallinity and permanent porosity. By following this approach and by optimizing the synthesis conditions for the solvothermal growth of thin films, we fabricated the first preferentially oriented conjugated 3D COF films on various substrates without pre&#8208;functionalization. With these thin films, optical pump terahertz probe studies allowed us, for the first time with 3D&#8208;fully conjugated COFs, to provide insights into the excited state and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics of these unique organic frameworks. Low effective masses are discovered for valence and conduction bands by density functional theory simulations. The ability to create crystalline and oriented films of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COTh&#8208;based COFs on non&#8208;modified substrates is expected to open the way for integration of such frameworks into diverse optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Dynamic Active Site Evolution in Lanthanum&#8208;Based Catalysts Dictates Ethane Chlorination Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LaOCl&#8208;catalyzed C2H6 chlorination offers a low&#8208;carbon route for polyvinyl chloride synthesis, yet structural evolution occurs under Cl2 conditions. We establish structural sensitivity in La&#8208;catalyzed chlorination, and elucidate the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of LaCl3 and the role of hydroxyl groups in overchlorination, highlighting stabilization of LaOCl and hydroxyl chemistry modulation as key design principles to break selectivity limitations.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated chlorination of ethane presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) synthesis, yet selectivity toward 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane remains challenged by uncontrolled over&#8208;chlorination. Lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has emerged as a promising catalyst, but its structural dynamics under Cl2&#8208;rich conditions and the origin of selectivity loss remain elusive. Here, we integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings unveil a sequential LaOCl&#160;&#8594;&#160;LaCl3 transformation that dictates product distribution shifting from 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane to trichloroethane. Mechanistic insights reveal that surface hydroxyl groups, generated during catalyst chlorination, promote bidentate adsorption of 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane via hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, thereby activating C&#9472;Cl over&#8208;chlorination. Additionally, by employing Al2O3&#8208;supported LaCl3 model catalysts, the size&#8208;dependent chlorophilicity of the LaCl3 species is demonstrated. The bonding of interfacial oxygen with monolayer&#8208;dispersed LaCl3 species generates empty 4f&#8208;states above the Fermi level, creating strong Lewis acid sites that stabilize Cl radicals and selectively convert chloroethane to 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. In contrast, aggregated nanoparticles are inactive due to their inability to stabilize chlorine radical. Our findings establish important structure sensitivity in lanthanum&#8208;catalyzed chlorination and provide guiding principles for catalyst design, highlighting the importance of stabilizing metastable LaOClx species and modulating surface hydroxyl chemistry to overcome selectivity limitations.

         <title>High Turnover Frequency in the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrous Oxide to Dinitrogen at a Binuclear Copper Complex of 3,5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nitrous oxide reductase, a binuclear copper complex supported by carbon black was utilized for the electrocatalytic N&#8322;O reduction under ambient conditions. The binuclear Cu center enables exceptionally high turnover frequency and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for the electrochemical N&#8322;O reduction.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone&#8208;depleting substance. Electrocatalytic N2O reduction (e&#8208;N2ORR) is a promising approach to remove N2O from the air under ambient conditions. However, developing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free e&#8208;N2ORR electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and turnover frequency (TOF) remains a challenge because of the weak binding of N2O and the high kinetic barrier for deoxygenation reaction. In this work, inspired by the multinuclear copper active site of nitrous oxide reductases, a binuclear copper complex of 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole supported on carbon black of Ketjenblack (CuHdatrz/KB) was utilized for the e&#8208;N2ORR at pH 13 and 298&#160;K. CuHdatrz/KB achieves a high FE of&#160;&#8776;&#160;100% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for the e&#8208;N2ORR to N2 and TOF up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;700&#160;h&#8722;1, which is one&#8211;two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previously reported molecular&#8208;based catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Cu(II) ions of CuHdatrz/KB are reduced to Cu(I) keeping the binuclear core, suggesting that the multinuclear copper active site is crucial to efficiently catalyze the e&#8208;N2ORR like the nitrous oxide reductase.

     alt="High Turnover Frequency in the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrous Oxide to Dinitrogen at a Binuclear Copper Complex of 3,5-Diamino-1,2,4-Triazole"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by nitrous oxide reductase, a binuclear copper complex supported by carbon black was utilized for the electrocatalytic N&#8322;O reduction under ambient conditions. The binuclear Cu center enables exceptionally high turnover frequency and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for the electrochemical N&#8322;O reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone-depleting substance. Electrocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reduction (e-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ORR) is a promising approach to remove N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from the air under ambient conditions. However, developing noble-metal-free e-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ORR electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and turnover frequency (TOF) remains a challenge because of the weak binding of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and the high kinetic barrier for deoxygenation reaction. In this work, inspired by the multinuclear copper active site of nitrous oxide reductases, a binuclear copper complex of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole supported on carbon black of Ketjenblack (CuHdatrz/KB) was utilized for the e-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ORR at pH 13 and 298&#160;K. CuHdatrz/KB achieves a high FE of&#160;&#8776;&#160;100% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for the e-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ORR to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TOF up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;700&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is one&#8211;two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previously reported molecular-based catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Cu(II) ions of CuHdatrz/KB are reduced to Cu(I) keeping the binuclear core, suggesting that the multinuclear copper active site is crucial to efficiently catalyze the e-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ORR like the nitrous oxide reductase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Dearomatization of Naphthalene and Anthracene with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes Through Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated intramolecular dearomatization strategy of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with anthracene and naphthalene was reported. Bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks could be obtained and (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs was achieved through this strategy along with further transformations. Mechanistic studies have shown that the key singlet biradical intermediate leads to the generation of two products, and the substituent on BCBs bridgehead position play a decisive role in product selectivity. 








Abstract
Cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) is an effective way to construct saturated polycyclic 3D structures. Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular dearomative reaction to forge bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks through (1,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs. Moreover, the unprecedented (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs through 1,4&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process was also realized along with the further transformations. The mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction was initially carried out by an energy transfer (EnT) process and the key open&#8208;shell singlet biradical intermediate may undergo [4&#960;&#160;+&#160;2&#963;] cycloaddition or 1,4&#8208;HAT process leading to the formation of two products and we found that the selectivity of product is related to the substituents at the BCBs bridgehead position. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling and kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Angularly Resolved Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We find that the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal (TERS) is angularly distributed and vibrational mode specific. The radiation pattern in the back focal plane (BFP) of vertical or parallel Raman dipoles is strongly influenced by the near&#8208;field in the TERS nanogap, while the emission is guided into the far&#8208;field with high directionality by the tip&#8208;sample antenna; however, with significant differences in the emission angle, intensity, and the divergency.

Abstract
Despite intensive research in tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), the angular distribution of Raman scattering in the TERS gap remains experimentally unreported leaving its relevance to the TERS signal formation to be seldomly discussed. Here, we investigate the angular distribution of the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal in the Fourier plane using a model system composed of flat&#8208;lying cobalt (II) hexadecafluoro&#8208;phthalocyanine (CoPcF16) molecules physically adsorbed on a smooth gold surface. Both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational modes are observed, where the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Raman modes at about 678 and 740&#160;cm&#8722;1 have different angular intensity distributions than those of in&#8208;plane Raman modes at 1309 and 1373&#160;cm&#8722;1. We interpret the angular spectrum of the TERS signal considering the molecular vibrational modes computed with density functional theory (DFT) for the free and gold&#8208;deposited molecule, and the directed Raman scattering by the gap&#8208;mode predicted by finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulations. We contend that the TERS gap directs the Raman vibrational modes differently, leading to distinct angularly distributed Raman scattering intensities. These findings emphasize the nonnegligible role of the TERS detection scheme in understanding spectral features, such as the relative peak intensity ratio variations for studying molecular orientations, or for monitoring chemical reactions.

         <title>Introducing Steric Bulk Into Silylboranes: Enhanced Bench Stability and Novel Chemical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following initial experimental and theoretical studies that indicated that silylboranes decompose via oxygenation, bulky silyl anions were used to synthesize silylboranes with enhanced bench stability and novel reactivity. These kinetically stabilized silylboranes are stable in air and moderately activate carbon monoxide (CO) to form spirocyclic compounds. DFT calculations suggested that the activation of CO is driven by hyperconjugation.








Abstract
Silylboranes are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, and a wide range of structural variants of silylboranes have already been synthesized. However, the stability of silylboranes varies significantly, and their decomposition mechanism remains to be fully understood. Moreover, some silylborane motifs have not yet been applied as synthetic reagents due to their instability. To address this issue, we first investigated the decomposition mechanism of silylboranes in air and moisture using experimental and theoretical methods. We discovered that oxygenation by atmospheric oxygen is the major decomposition pathway, resulting in the formation of a borylsilylether, and that the introduction of a bulky silyl group suppresses this decomposition. Based on these results, we synthesized triisopropylsilyldimesitylborane (i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2), which exhibits high bench stability. Moreover, i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2 reacts with carbon monoxide (CO), which is the first example of a reaction between a silylborane and CO. Further computational studies revealed that electronic effects, including hyperconjugation between the Si&#9472;B &#963;&#8208;bond and C&#9472;O &#960;*&#8208;bond, are crucial for CO activation. Furthermore, we prepared a bench&#8208;stable bissilylaminoborane by introducing triisopropylsilyl groups, providing a bissilylchloroborane upon hydrogen chloride treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into how steric and electronic effects can be used to optimize the balance between stability and reactivity in silylboranes.

Bending and stretching effect provoked by the repeated application of 385&#8208;nm radiation (purple) and 475&#8208;nm radiation (blue) on sulfur microcrystals.








Abstract
Here, we describe the synthesis and photo&#8208;responsive properties of 2D cyclo&#8208;octasulfur microcrystals (&#945;&#8208;S8 MCs), produced using a quick, simple, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. Controlled 385&#8208;nm irradiation of these crystals induces an immediate, reversible, and sustained bending effect. The time required for the crystals to return to their initial shape is significantly reduced when exposed to 475&#8208;nm light, completing the entire excitation&#8208;relaxation cycle in less than 2 s. Moreover, this process can be repeated up to 50 times as long as the crystals remain in water. The dependence of recovery time on light wavelength is rationalized qualitatively via highly correlated quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the absorption spectra of S8 chains. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of ring&#8208;to&#8208;chain and chain&#8208;to&#8208;ring transformations: the breaking of &#945;&#8208;S8 rings by 385&#8208;nm radiation induces bending in the &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs, while the excitation of the chains with 475&#8208;nm light facilitates an accelerated recovery process, allowing the S8 molecules to swiftly regain their ring shape. Thus, our study demonstrates that &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs represent intelligent actuators as light&#8208;controlled molecular muscles with the simplest inorganic composition reported to date.

&lt;p&gt;Bending and stretching effect provoked by the repeated application of 385-nm radiation (purple) and 475-nm radiation (blue) on sulfur microcrystals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we describe the synthesis and photo-responsive properties of 2D cyclo-octasulfur microcrystals (&#945;-&lt;i&gt;S8&lt;/i&gt; MCs), produced using a quick, simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. Controlled 385-nm irradiation of these crystals induces an immediate, reversible, and sustained bending effect. The time required for the crystals to return to their initial shape is significantly reduced when exposed to 475-nm light, completing the entire excitation-relaxation cycle in less than 2 s. Moreover, this process can be repeated up to 50 times as long as the crystals remain in water. The dependence of recovery time on light wavelength is rationalized qualitatively via highly correlated quantum-chemical calculations of the absorption spectra of &lt;i&gt;S8&lt;/i&gt; chains. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of ring-to-chain and chain-to-ring transformations: the breaking of &#945;-&lt;i&gt;S8&lt;/i&gt; rings by 385-nm radiation induces bending in the &#945;-&lt;i&gt;S8&lt;/i&gt; MCs, while the excitation of the chains with 475-nm light facilitates an accelerated recovery process, allowing the &lt;i&gt;S8&lt;/i&gt; molecules to swiftly regain their ring shape. Thus, our study demonstrates that &#945;-&lt;i&gt;S8&lt;/i&gt; MCs represent intelligent actuators as light-controlled molecular muscles with the simplest inorganic composition reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Addition of Glycinate to Nitroalkenes by Pyridoxal/Nd Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system enables asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes, providing a highly efficient approach to make biologically significant &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes is a significant organic transformation, which may provide a highly efficient strategy to make bioactive chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve this reaction due to the interference of the reactive NH2 group, potential [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition side reaction and complicated stereoselective control. Carbonyl catalysis is an effective strategy to activate glycinate by forming an imine to facilitate the conjugate addition. With a pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system, direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C conjugate addition of glycinate to nitroalkenes has been successfully developed for the first time, producing a broad range of chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 98% ee). The products can be easily converted into various biologically significant chiral molecules maintaining the same enantiopurity.

         <title>Decoy DNA Protects Molecular Tension Probes from DNase Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based probes are rapidly degraded by DNases in live&#8208;cell environments, limiting their use. We introduce a decoy DNA strategy, where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA acts as a competitive substrate for DNases, protecting functional DNA probes and significantly extending their stability for long&#8208;term live&#8208;cell studies.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular probes are essential tools for visualizing and quantifying mechanotransduction at the single&#8208;molecule level. However, their application in live&#8208;cell environments is severely limited by DNase&#8208;mediated degradation, which shortens probe lifespan and introduces false&#8208;positive signals. Here, we present a decoy DNA strategy where an excess of unmodified double&#8208;stranded DNA competitively binds DNases, effectively preserving functional DNA probes. This approach extends probe stability from 1&#8211;2 h to beyond 24 h, substantially improving signal integrity in live&#8208;cell tension imaging. In contrast to structurally modified nucleic acids, decoy DNA can be readily applied to existing DNA probe systems, enabling seamless integration without the need for additional validation or calibration. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy provides a generalizable framework for stabilizing DNA&#8208;based molecular tools in DNase&#8208;rich environments, enabling high&#8208;precision mechanobiology studies across diverse cell types and extended experiment durations.

         <title>Counterintuitive Photochemistry of an Isolated Acridinyl Radical: ConPET via Preassembly, Solvated Electrons or a Long&#8208;Lived Excited State?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we isolate the reduced form of a commonly used acridinium photocatalyst (acridinyl, Acr&#8226;) and investigate its photochemistry using transient absorption, analysed alongside TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We show that despite the apparent long lifetime of the fluorescent state of Acr&#8226;, it is not relevant to reactivity. Instead, reactivity occurs through counterintuitive preassembly and solvated electron&#8208;based mechanisms.








Abstract
Photoredox chemistry has seen a dramatic rise in popularity in recent years, but mechanistic understanding has persistently lagged behind reaction development itself. This is particularly true for the emerging area of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (conPET), which has attracted both great interest due to its ability to activate inert substrates selectively and under mild conditions and continuing controversy over its mechanistic feasibility. We describe herein the isolation of the key radical intermediate state of an acridinium&#8208;based conPET catalyst and detailed investigations of its photochemistry by a suite of (photo)reactivity, photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques, supported by computational studies. We observe strong wavelength and solvent dependencies in the reactivity profile, which correlate well with observations of a long&#8208;lived, fluorescent excited state that would be compatible with diffusion&#8208;limited reactivity. However, photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies suggest that, counter&#8208;intuitively, this state does not actually participate in reactivity. Instead, changes occur far faster than the diffusion limit, which provides strong, direct evidence for preassembly of the photocatalyst and substrate prior to photoexcitation. Further inspection also indicates parallel formation of solvated electrons, likely providing the major pathway under previously reported synthetic conditions, suggesting that otherwise competing rationales for conPET can in fact operate simultaneously.

         <dc:description>
We report a novel and versatile self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional polymer brushes under ambient conditions with exceptional oxygen tolerance. By introducing a bimetal CuZn alloy, the system self&#8208;adaptively regulates the dissociation of copper species, ensuring robust and controllable polymer brush growth across a wide range of distances between the bimetallic alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate.








Abstract
We report herein a self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (SI&#8208;BMCRP) for fabricating various polymer brushes using microliter volumes under ambient conditions. The introduction of bimetal CuZn alloy can self&#8208;adaptively control the dissociation of copper species while still realizing the controllability of polymer brush growth with high oxygen tolerance at a wide range of distances between the bimetal alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate. The successful fabrication of multiscale and multifunctional polymer brushes with high&#8208;end group fidelity and patterned architectures further demonstrates the robust nature of SI&#8208;BMCRP. The resultant polymer brushes show great potential for new applications in moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation, breath monitoring, and speech recognition.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioreversible Arginine Modification of amine&#8208;containing protein residues (termed BioRAM) allows the serum&#8208;compatible, readily accessible, and efficient delivery of native proteins into live cells. Combined with cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) additives, BioRAM results in intracellular RNase A activity at nanomolar concentrations, thus enabling the cellular delivery of native protein cargoes without additional genetic engineering. 








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based tools are emerging as innovative solutions to interfere with biological pathways in molecular biology and medicine. They offer advantages over traditional small molecules due to their adaptable structural diversity and their ability to engage previously inaccessible cellular targets. However, most proteins do not penetrate the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells and are therefore restricted to extracellular targets. Despite recent advances, a general method for the delivery of functional proteins into human cells remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a bioreversible protein modification strategy of amines using short arginine&#8208;containing peptides (termed BioRAM) that enables cytosolic delivery starting from genetically non&#8208;engineered proteins. We optimized the bioconjugation strategy to achieve fast intracellular cleavage and complete recovery of the native protein. In combination with our previously established cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;additive protocol, we show superior delivery of fluorescent protein and functional RNase A into the cytosol, achieving physiological response. Moreover, we are able to demonstrate the excellent performance of BioRAM in the presence of serum, thereby broadening the scope for intracellular applications of functional proteins.

         <title>Sequential Reconstruction of Calicheamicin &#947;1I Iodo&#8208;Thiobenzoate by Selective Carrier Protein Trapping Reveals a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Iodinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic synthesis of the iodo&#8208;thiobenzoate of calicheamicin &#947;1I was reconstituted in vitro from malonyl&#8208;CoA, involving the orsellinate biosynthesis by CalO5 and subsequent modifications by CalO6, CalO3, CalO2, and CalO1. A TEV site was introduced into CalO5, enabling the successful detection of the intermediate or product attached to the ACP domain through intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometric analysis.








Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) play important roles in natural product biosynthesis, particularly chlorinases and brominases. Apart from ubiquitous mammalian iodination in thyroxine biosynthesis, iodinated natural products are extremely rare, and enzymes responsible for iodination are even less well described. A notable exception is calicheamicin &#947;1I, a potent antitumor compound containing an aromatic iodide, for which a halogenase has been proposed to mediate iodine incorporation. Despite predictions regarding the enzymes involved in iodinated aryl ring biosynthesis, experimental evidence remains limited due to challenges in substrate identification and reaction monitoring. In this study, we successfully reconstituted the enzymatic activities required for iodination and all embellishments of the highly substituted benzene ring in calicheamicin &#947;1I. Using intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometry combined with protease cleavage, we demonstrated formation of the orsellinate thioester followed by sequential C&#8208;2 O&#8208;methylation, C&#8208;5 iodination, C&#8208;3 oxidation, and C&#8208;3 O&#8208;methylation. This research characterizes the first flavin&#8208;dependent iodinase that acts on a carrier protein&#8208;dependent substrate, identifies the natural substrates of a cytochrome P450 oxygenase and two O&#8208;methyltransferases, and provides valuable insights for biocatalysis. Additionally, these findings could facilitate the engineering of other polyketide biosynthetic pathways and contribute to optimizing fermentation conditions to generate new calicheamicin derivatives.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Supported Ru&#8211;Ni: A Common Active Site for Hydrolysis, Hydrogen Oxidation, and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 catalyst was utilized to investigate the activation and conversion of hydrogen. RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits outstanding activity in AB hydrolysis, HOR, and phenylethylene tandem reaction, especially TOF of AB hydrolysis up to 1833 min&#8722;1.








Abstract
Insights into the activation and conversion of hydrogen using a single&#8208;mode catalyst are crucial for advancing fuels and fine chemical production. In this paper, the activation and conversion of H2 molecules in hydrogen production and application were investigated on RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe)&#8208;MXene catalysts. RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) bimetallic nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on Ti3C2 MXene. The optimal Ru2.5Ni2.5&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1833 min&#8722;1 toward ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalysts also showed good catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The high activity originates from the acceleration of the catalytic process by RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 and the promotion of H2 molecular transport by the special interface of RuNi cluster&#8208;MXene. The RuNi clusters&#8212;Ti3C2 with multisites provide a dependable platform for the regulated activation and conversion of H2 molecules and various reaction intermediates. The competitiveness of nanocluster&#8208;MXene catalytic material is showcased for activation and conversion of hydrogen. This research of reaction&#8208;inducing adaptation uncovered the pathway to explore multifunctional catalysts in energy, chemistry, and materials applications.

A redox&#8208;active low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complex was isolated in good yield and utilized as a catalyst for radical polymerization of acrylamides and methacrylates at ambient conditions.








Abstract
Two unprecedented redox&#8208;active, low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complexes, [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3]&#183;NHC&#9552;S (1&#183;NHC&#9552;S; E&#9552;S) and [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;Se&#8226;&#8722;)3] (2; E&#9552;Se) have been synthesized and structurally characterized by SCXRD. They were further characterized spectroscopically using IR, Raman, EPR, and UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. The low&#8208;spin electronic configuration of the central Fe(III) ion (1) and the nature of the magnetic interaction between the Fe(III) center and the three unpaired electrons in 1 have been investigated by magnetic measurements. In addition, the bonding stability and electron density distribution in 1 were studied by quantum chemical calculations and correlated with experimental results. Finally, a series of well&#8208;defined functional homopolymers were synthesized via catalytic polymerization reactions using [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3] (1) as a catalyst at ambient temperature. These reactions yielded poly(N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA), poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), and poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) with low dispersities ranging from 1.2 to 1.22. The successful synthesis of various diblock copolymers confirmed excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity of the synthesized homopolymers. These homopolymers and diblock copolymers highlight the versatile catalytic polymerization reactions of these Fe&#8208;radical complexes. Herein, we present a report on the polymerization of various acrylamides and methacrylates using a redox&#8208;active Fe&#8208;dithiolene complex for the first time.

         <title>Hybrid Cathode Interlayer Engineering Enables Over 20% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is developed by using polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine as a guest material to improve the photovoltaic performance of the perylene&#8208;diimide cathode interlayer. Benefitted from the improved ohmic contact, interfacial compatibility, and carrier dynamics of PDINN:F16CuPc, a remarkable efficiency of 20.17% is achieved in the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device, which is higher than that of the control PDINN&#8208;based device with an efficiency of 19.29%.








Abstract
The capability of cathode interlayer (CIL) in regulating the conductivity, interfacial dipole, and work function of the electrode plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The widely used perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs suffered from the inbuilt limitation of finite conductivity and poor thickness tolerance. To address this issue, we develop a universal strategy to finely optimize the functionality of perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;type CIL (PDINN) by incorporating polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) derivative to form a hybrid CIL. It is found that the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between PDINN and CuPc can address the solvent processability issue of CuPc used as CIL. The incorporation of CuPc in the PDINN layer leads to better film morphology, increased conductivity, and reduced cathode work function, enabling greater CIL thickness tolerance and significantly improved photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Notably, the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device using PDINN:F16CuPc as hybrid CIL yields a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.17%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 19.29% for the control device based on PDINN CIL. Particularly, this strategy demonstrates a universality in multiple photoactive layers and various perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs, offering an effective approach to developing highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Engineered C&#8211;N Lyases for Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
EDDS lyase was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final mutant, EDDS lyase CEA, accepts various N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines derivatives, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids, as well as several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines, producing N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids.








Abstract
Optically pure N&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acids are valuable chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and agrochemicals. Ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid lyase from Chelativorans sp. BNC1 catalyzes the addition of a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic primary amines to fumarate, producing the corresponding enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted L&#8208;aspartic acids. In this work, the enzyme was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final variant displayed an activity of three orders of magnitude higher compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme. Unexpectedly, the enzyme catalyzed the hydroamination of fumarate with the aliphatic secondary amine of the starting substrate, rather than with the aromatic primary amine, leading to the formation of a tertiary amine. Exploring the substrate scope showed that the enzyme accepts various substituted N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines for the hydroamination of fumarate, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids in high optical purity (up to &gt;99% ee). Furthermore, we showed that the enzyme accepts several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines that were previously not accepted by the wild&#8208;type enzyme, yielding the corresponding N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids in high enantiomeric excess (&gt;99% ee). This serendipitous finding enables a new strategy for the biocatalytic synthesis of tertiary amines, unlocked within the C&#8208;N lyase toolbox.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porous Aromatic Framework Cathode with Fast Redox Kinetics for Ultralow&#8208;Temperature (&#8722;70&#160;&#176;C) Potassium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We propose the novel concept of the application of donor&#8211;acceptor porous aromatic framework (named as PAF&#8208;310) constructed from two types (n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type) storage blocks to accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics in potassium ion batteries, which shows the impressively electrochemical properties at room and low&#8208;temperature (even &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C) with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage mechanism.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1) at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 130.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C at 0.2 A g&#8722;1). Even at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8722; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Red Algal Diterpene Peyssonnosol in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpene synthases derived from Anaerolineae bacteria catalyse the biosynthesis of peyssonnosene&#8208;type diterpenes from red algae. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis enabled a partial functional switch, resulting in the formation of additional byproducts. The intricate cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
Two diterpene synthases (DTSs) for peyssonnosol and peyssonnosol B were discovered in bacteria. Their enzyme mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, yielding biosynthetically related molecules that gave important insights into the terpene cyclisation cascade. In the present case, several mechanisms in line with the isotopic labelling experiments could be formulated. Only an extended experimental approach in combination with computational chemistry ultimately resulted in a refined mechanistic model.

         <title>Controlling Assembly of Hybrid DNA Nanostructures into Higher&#8208;Order Structures via Hydrophobicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We harness hydrophobic interactions, fundamental in biology yet underutilized in DNA nanotechnology, to build a design framework for hierarchical DNA assemblies. By conjugating small hydrophobic molecules to DNA motifs, we controlled the formation of higher&#8208;order structures, moving beyond traditional Watson&#8211;Crick pairing.








Abstract
Hydrophobic interactions are one of the fundamental driving forces of self&#8208;assembly in living systems. It remains challenging to harness hydrophobicity to have a controllable and programmable assembly of DNA nanostructures. On the other hand, there is also a need to explore orthogonal hierarchical assembly strategies to be used as an additional toolset along with the traditional Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing to achieve complex superstructures. In this work, we rationally design and synthesize a series of low molecular weight hydrophobic molecules that are conjugated to single&#8208;stranded DNA strands. By incorporating these modified DNA strands into the precisely defined locations of DNA tiles and origami nanostructures, we achieve controlled hierarchical assembly driven by hydrophobic interaction. We demonstrate a versatile hydrophobicity&#8208;guided higher&#8208;order assembly strategy by employing strategically engineered DNA nanostructures of increasing complexity, ranging from simple DNA tiles to complex origami structures, functionalized with these small hydrophobic molecules as programmable building blocks.

         <title>Resiquimod&#8208;Induced Nanovaccine (RINV) for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the dual roles of resiquimod (R848) as both an immune stimulant and a structural unit, this study conjugates R848 onto fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer to develop an antigen carrier G5&#8208;R848. G5&#8208;R848 forms stable nanovaccines with OVA model antigen or tumor lysates and facilitates cytosolic antigen delivery. The nanovaccines demonstrate potent DCs maturation and cross&#8208;presentation and elicit significantly increased tumor antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell responses.








Abstract
Cancer nanovaccines have emerged as a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy due to their capability of eliciting robust tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. However, structural complexity and insufficient spatiotemporal coordination of immune activation pose substantial challenges for optimizing the therapeutic potential of nanovaccines. Herein, a resiquimod&#8208;induced nanovaccine (RINV) is devised for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) was covalently conjugated to fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer through a disulfide linker to obtain the vaccine carrier G5&#8208;R848. In this design, R848 not only fulfills its biological role as a vaccine adjuvant but facilitates uniform nanovaccine formation with the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) due to its distinctive chemical structure. Redox&#8208;triggered intracellular R848 release further promotes cytosolic delivery of antigen and subsequent antigen cross&#8208;presentation. In vivo studies demonstrated that the nanovaccine induces remarkable prophylactic and therapeutic effects in the B16F10&#8208;OVA melanoma model. Moreover, G5&#8208;R848 forms personalized nanovaccines by complexing with cell lysates from resected B16F10 and 4T1 tumor tissues, effectively inhibiting postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Bonnadiene and ent&#8208;Polytrichastrene B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B has been accomplished. An enantioselective redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation was used to form the stereocenter at C7. The unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic structure was constructed via [5+2] cycloaddition. The functionalities in the spirotricycle have been strategically utilized to append the remaining moieties present in the natural product in a sequential manner. Moreover, two Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes were employed to reduce the unactivated tetrasubstituted olefin and to construct the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring.








Abstract
We report herein the first asymmetric total synthesis of bonnadiene and ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B, two diterpenoids that share a common spirotricyclic skeleton. Notably, ent&#8208;polytrichastrene B also features a highly strained, sterically congested tetrasubstituted cyclopropane moiety, presenting significant synthetic challenges in both its construction and stereochemical control. The synthesis features: (1) palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective redox&#8208;relay Heck alkenylation between electron&#8208;withdrawing alkenyl triflate and primary alkenol to form the stereocenter at C7; (2) diastereoselective intramolecular [5+2] cycloaddition to rapidly assemble the unique [6,7,5] spirotricyclic skeleton; (3) sequential installation of the requisite alkyl groups and alkenes present in the targeted molecule by leveraging the functionalities positioned on the tricycle; (4) Fe&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;initiated hydrogenation to stereospecifically reduce the tetrasubstituted &#916;10,11 olefin and install the contiguous stereocenters; (5) Fe&#8208;mediated HAT&#8208;initiated 3&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization to rapidly forge the tetrasubstituted cyclopropane ring with excellent stereoselectivity.

         <title>Tunable Endo/Exo Selectivity in Direct Catalytic Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions with Polyfunctional Lewis Acid / Azolium&#8211;Aryloxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept for catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with iminoesters employs modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide betaine catalysts, controlling endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selectivity through adjustments of metal center, azolium, and sterics. DFT studies reveal an almost perfect spatial fit of functional sites, enabling precise orchestration of the catalytically relevant moieties involved&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis.








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions (1,3&#8208;DCA) using iminoesters as ylide precursors offer a powerful approach to accessing stereochemically complex, biologically relevant pyrrolidines. Although previous studies have already achieved impressive stereoselectivities, catalytic productivity remains a challenge, with turnover numbers (TON) typically below 20. In this article, we introduce a novel concept for catalytic 1,3&#8208;DCA that enables remarkable productivity for both endo (TON up to 4000) and the more challenging exo products (TON up to 1500). This approach, making use of modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide catalysts, allows for precise control over endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The switch from endo&#8208; to exo&#8208;selectivity is accomplished by modifying the metal center, the azolium moiety, and steric factors. As detailed DFT studies reveal, both the endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selective catalyst systems exhibit an almost perfect spatial alignment of their key functional sites, allowing for a unique interplay of Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, Lewis acids, and hydrogen bonding. The computational studies further demonstrate that these polyfunctional catalysts dramatically lower the energetic barriers of the concerted or stepwise cycloaddition key steps. However, they also precisely orchestrate and accelerate all accompanying transformations&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic machineries.

         <title>Origin of Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structures in Siloxane Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane electrolytes exhibit anion&#8208;rich solvation structures due to their large steric hindrance. The lower Pauli repulsion of Si&#9472;O bond compared to C&#9472;O bond leads to higher intrinsic stability than corresponding ethers.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. Siloxane electrolytes exhibit excellent performance in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Herein, the mechanisms responsible for the Li metal compatibility and high&#8208;voltage resistance of siloxane electrolytes were probed by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental characterizations.

The silicon (Si)&#9472;oxygen (O) bond energy of siloxane is larger than that of carbon (C)&#9472;O of C&#8208;siloxane (replacing Si atoms in siloxane with C atoms) because the atomic radius of Si is larger than that of C, and the Pauli exclusion of Si is smaller than that of C. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that the decomposition of siloxane produces substances containing Si&#9472;O fragments on Li metal surfaces, which is beneficial for interfacial stability.

&lt;p&gt;Siloxane electrolytes exhibit anion-rich solvation structures due to their large steric hindrance. The lower Pauli repulsion of Si&#9472;O bond compared to C&#9472;O bond leads to higher intrinsic stability than corresponding ethers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next-generation high-energy-density rechargeable batteries. Siloxane electrolytes exhibit excellent performance in high-voltage LMBs. Herein, the mechanisms responsible for the Li metal compatibility and high-voltage resistance of siloxane electrolytes were probed by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, first-principles calculations, and experimental characterizations. Siloxane electrolytes have been demonstrated to deliver anion-rich solvation structures, which are induced by weak Li ion (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;solvent interactions and strong Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;anion interactions. The silicon (Si)&#9472;oxygen (O) bond energy of siloxane is larger than that of carbon (C)&#9472;O of C-siloxane (replacing Si atoms in siloxane with C atoms) because the atomic radius of Si is larger than that of C, and the Pauli exclusion of Si is smaller than that of C. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that the decomposition of siloxane produces substances containing Si&#9472;O fragments on Li metal surfaces, which is beneficial for interfacial stability.

         <title>Divergent Upcycling of Polystyrene into Phenol and Hydroquinone Derivatives by Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel divergent upcycling of PS to high value&#8208;added phenol and hydroquinone derivatives by photocatalysis and electrocatalysis with high chemical selectivity. This method operates under 1 atm air and room temperature with an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful depolymerization of real&#8208;life polystyrene (PS) using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, highlighting its promising potential for the chemical recycling of PS waste.








Abstract
The selective upcycling of polystyrene (PS) waste into value&#8208;added aromatics has emerged as a compelling strategy toward sustainable plastic valorization, drawing significant scientific and industrial interest. While most existing methods involved oxidative C&#9472;C bond cleavage predominantly yield benzoic acid, the direct conversion of waste PS into phenolic compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first example of photocatalytic upcycling of PS into phenol derivatives with high chemoselectivity. This economical method proceeds under ambient conditions (1 atm air and room temperature) using an inexpensive organic photocatalyst via photooxidation&#8208;induced Hock rearrangement in a single step. The use of strong acid effectively suppresses the formation of benzoic acid, playing a critical role in high selectivity. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cis configuration of neighboring phenyl rings in PS raises the barrier for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from the benzylic C&#9472;H bond, thereby contributing to the low polymer conversion. Furthermore, the novel divergent upcycling of PS to hydroquinone derivatives was achieved by a photo&#8208;electro tandem strategy. The practicality of this strategy is demonstrated by depolymerization of real&#8208;life PS using a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation platform, underscoring its promising potential for sustainable and scalable upcycling of PS waste.

         <title>Tunable Oxygen Vacancy Clusters Enhanced Catalytic Activity of CeO2 Nanorods on CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and halogen&#8208;free strategy for CO2 cycloaddition is achieved using CeO2 nanorods enriched with oxygen vacancy clusters. The Ce3+ ions and lattice oxygens in the vicinity of the vacancy clusters construct abundant frustrated Lewis pair sites, which boost substrate adsorption and activation, reduce reaction energy barriers, stabilize intermediates, and accelerate product desorption.








Abstract
Constructing heterogeneous halogen&#8208;free catalysts featuring efficiently activated CO2 and epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via an atom&#8208;economical route is significant but remains a big challenge. In this work, we develop an atmosphere&#8208;assisted strategy for preparing mesoporous CeO2 nanorods with tunable oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations, which boosts the performance of CO2 cycloaddition. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis elucidates that oxygen vacancy clusters regulate the dynamic equilibrium of the multiscale structure of CeO2 via a synergistic &#8220;compression&#8208;expansion&#8221; mechanism. Furthermore, the high concentrations of oxygen vacancy clusters form abundant frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) sites, which remarkably promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 with epoxides. Thus, the performance of CO2 cycloaddition was substantially intensified. A 95% yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when the reaction was conducted with RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 at 110&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the kinetic properties and the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition on FLP sites in RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 were investigated based on the in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts with tunable FLP sites for the efficient activation and conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals by modulating oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Hollow Microreactors with Catalytic Nanobrushes for Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated living CDSA endows the engineering of the surface of hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures and enables specific inner&#8208;outer spatial isolation of various catalytic species on tailored microreactor. Notably, the microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes and internal Pt&#8208;Ni alloys revealed prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine (95.4% sel.).








Abstract
Micro/nanoreactors with hollow structures have traditionally focused on the design of the internal catalytic microenvironment, while precise engineering of their external surfaces at a nanoscale level is particularly rare. Here, we develop a unique approach to elaborately engineer the surface of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;based hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures that serve as an external catalytic platform. This involves the anchoring of high&#8208;density micellar brushes onto the epidermis of ZIF&#8208;8 via surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, followed by the rapid capture of multiple species to fabricate the catalytic nanobrushes. Such a nanoscale fluff&#8208;like surface in combination with an internal cavity that encapsulates other functional components enables specific spatial isolation of various catalysts. The resultant microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes for esterification and internal Pt&#9472;Ni alloys for hydrogenation reveals prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine with a high selectivity of 95.4%. Remarkably, the microreactor decorated with PW12 nanobrushes can greatly prompt the catalytic efficiency of esterification with the inhibited competition from the hydrogenation reaction. Overall, this work provides an innovative guidance for the rational creation of multifunctional microreactors with fine surface nanostructures.

         <title>Length Ratio&#8208;Driven Configurational Modulation of Heteroleptic Pd6L6L&#8217;6 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically modulating the ligand length ratio (r) between the two types of ligands in the octahedral heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages, the local steric hindrance of each triangular face was altered. This subsequently adjusted the energy difference between the Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B isomers, ultimately driving a directional transformation of the cage configuration.








Abstract
Biomolecular configurational modulation is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of biological systems. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we present a strategy to modulate the configurations of heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages by systematically varying the ligand length ratio (r). Although theoretical analysis suggests that these Pd6L6L'6 assemblies could adopt up to 48 possible configurational isomers, we successfully modulated the thermodynamic preference between two dominant configurations (Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B) by implementing energetic differentiation through careful optimization of r. Specifically, the system exclusively forms Type&#8208;A cages at r&#160;=&#160;1.0, whereas Type&#8208;B becomes the predominant configuration when r&#160;&#8805;&#160;1.4. Control experiments demonstrate that the introduction of bulky steric groups does not induce configuration changes. This research offers valuable insights and serves as a useful reference for the design and configurational modulation of heteroleptic cages.

Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we present a strategy to modulate the configurations of heteroleptic &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L'&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; cages by systematically varying the ligand length ratio (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;). Although theoretical analysis suggests that these &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L'&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; assemblies could adopt up to 48 possible configurational isomers, we successfully modulated the thermodynamic preference between two dominant configurations (Type-A and Type-B) by implementing energetic differentiation through careful optimization of &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;. Specifically, the system exclusively forms Type-A cages at &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1.0, whereas Type-B becomes the predominant configuration when &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;1.4. Control experiments demonstrate that the introduction of bulky steric groups does not induce configuration changes. This research offers valuable insights and serves as a useful reference for the design and configurational modulation of heteroleptic cages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in Small&#8208;Ring Transfer: Direct Decarboxylative Hydroalkylation of Alkenes via Iron&#8208;Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a catalytic approach for the direct decarboxylation of challenging CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl carboxylic acids using cooperative iron&#8208;thiol catalysis. This strategy enables the efficient generation of valuable radicals that can be incorporated into activated and unactivated alkenes, offering access to elusive chemical space. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive mechanistic studies, supported by experimental, spectroscopic, and DFT data, which offer insights into radical stability in small&#8208;ring systems.








Abstract
Cyclopropanes, especially those substituted with trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Their enhanced bioavailability contributes to the widespread presence of this motif in a variety of bioactive compounds. Despite the development of multiple synthetic strategies, a direct method for transferring CF3&#8208;containing small rings from their most abundant carboxylic acid surrogates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we overcome the challenging decarboxylation of CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and CF3&#8208;cyclobutyl carboxylic acids while leveraging the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited state of photochemically activated iron complexes. The resulting radicals were then engaged in radical addition to alkenes, followed by a timely hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by a thiol donor. This efficient iron&#8208;thiol cooperative catalysis enables, for the first time, facile hydroalkylation of alkenes with highly reactive CF3&#8208;containing cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl radicals. Synergistic experimental, spectroscopic, and density functional theory (DFT) studies support the proposed reaction mechanism. Additionally, we employed the radical stabilization energy (RSE) scale, developed using isodesmic equations computed at the DFT level, aiming to provide a better understanding of the reluctant radical decarboxylation of small&#8208;strained cycloalkanes.

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a method to wind chiral graphene nanoribbons into either right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices, depending on the functional groups that adorn their edges. These helically wound graphene nanoribbons act as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to their chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.








Abstract
In this manuscript, we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high&#8208;yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65&#160;nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550&#160;nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Tailored Molybdenum&#8211;Nickel Catalyst Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation and Suppresses Parasitic Oxygen Reduction for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;tailored MoNi4 alloyed catalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) showing high hydrogen oxidation activity but low oxygen reduction activity in alkali has been developed. Such dual functionality tackles the issue of reverse&#8208;current decay&#8212;the harmful potential jump from parasitic anodic oxygen reduction during startup/shutdown events. When integrating into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell, this catalyst demonstrates superior corrosion resistance and durability compared with the Pt/C counterpart over repeated startup/shutdown cycles.








Abstract
Numerous existing strategies struggle to mitigate reverse&#8208;current decay (RCD) during startup and shutdown in polymer electrolyte fuel cells to avoid cathode corrosion, but the added system complexity and cost are drawbacks. Here, we report that modification of a molybdenum&#8211;nickel alloy through the doping of copper enables a non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) that efficiently catalyzes hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) while catalytically inactive toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, making it ideal for fuel&#8208;cell anode because the instantaneous interfacial potential jump originated from the parasitic ORR during device startup/shutdown can be surmounted. The catalyst, when assembled in the anode of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell, manifests substantially improved corrosion&#8208;resistant ability compared with that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt/C) catalyst. The basis for the achieved performances reveals to be the copper dopants that increase the hydrogen bonding of interfacial water for enhanced HOR, yet weaken molecular oxygen adsorption while stabilizing hydroxyl adsorption for ORR suppression.

         <title>Photoelectric/Photothermal Synergy Activation in Floating Aerogel Cathode Breaks Neutral Triphase Reaction Barriers for High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Responsive Seawater Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A unique photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated floating catalytic platform based on the rationally designed Janus aerogel has been explored to maximize sunlight utilization and overcome inherent kinetics/mass transport limitations of bifunctional oxygen reactions in neutral triphase systems, enabling a new class of full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery to achieve ultrahigh energy efficiency. It is unveiled that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically improve oxygen reaction kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates the adsorption energetics optimization of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Harnessing natural resources (solar, seawater) to explore next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage is an intriguing yet challenging task. Here, we establish a unique floating photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated catalytic platform based on engineered Janus aerogel that overcomes inherent mass transport/kinetics constraints in neutral triphase oxygen reaction systems to enable a full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery with ultrahigh energy efficiency. Our approach employs in situ region&#8208;selective assembly of the rationally designed fluorinated donor&#8211;acceptor polymers on carbon&#8208;nanotube aerogel (FMTAPPC), creating a new floatable FMTAPPC photoelectrode with asymmetric wettability, superior photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;response, and bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) catalysis. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration enables floating FMTAPPC to maximize sunlight utilization for interface micro&#8208;environment regulation and adsorbate binding optimization via photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activation while satisfying paradoxical wetting requirements of OER/ORR, which tunes reaction kinetics and intermediate energetics to remarkably promote both OER/ORR in neutral media. Under sunlight, floating FMTAPPC delivers large current densities for both OER/ORR&#8211;3&#8211;4 fold&#8208;enhancement over dark conditions. This enables the seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air battery to simultaneously improve charge/discharge performance at high rates and deliver ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 128.2%&#8212;surpassing most photo&#8208;assisted batteries. Mechanistic studies unveil that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically boost OER/ORR kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates intermediate energetics optimization, substantially lowering reaction energy barriers.

Mechanistic studies unveil that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically boost OER/ORR kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates intermediate energetics optimization, substantially lowering reaction energy barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spring&#8208;Like Behavior in [8]Helicene Diimides: How Helical Pitch Governs Optical Anisotropy and Electronic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the imide nitrogen atoms of [8]helicene diimides with different alkyl chains allows for precise control over the helical pitch of their backbones. This has a profound impact on the molecular packing, chiroptical properties, and through&#8208;space electronic conjugation of the molecules. As a result, this approach enables fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of this new class of materials with enhanced optical anisotropy and electronic communication.








Abstract
Helicenes, with their corkscrew&#8208;shaped geometry, have emerged as prototypical molecular springs for engineering chiral functional materials through precise structural modulation. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of [8]helicene diimides ([8]HDIs) and demonstrate that the helical pitch of their backbone can be precisely tuned by bridging the imide nitrogen atoms with alkyl chains of varying lengths (C3&#8211;C6). This approach constrains the molecular geometry to systematically control optical anisotropy, chiroptical response, and electronic communication. Remarkably, modulation of the helical pitch leads to high optical dissymmetry factors (up to 6.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and enhanced through&#8208;space conjugation. Furthermore, we investigate how variations in the helical pitch affect crystal packing in both enantiopure and racemic samples. Complementary quantum chemical calculations provide insights into the origins of these properties, highlighting the potential of this strategy for designing advanced chiral materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Hole&#8208;Selective Molecules for UV&#8208;Resistant High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

We develop a thiophene&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayer, referred to as Me&#8208;TPCP, which serves as the hole&#8208;selective layer for inverted perovskite solar cells. Me&#8208;TPCP demonstrates exceptional ultraviolet stability, superior hole extraction, and effective defect passivation capabilities. Consequently, we achieve a remarkable efficiency of 25.62% with excellent ultraviolet, operational, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced degradation, particularly occurring at the buried interface, has emerged as a significant stability challenge, severely limiting the widespread applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we rationally design and synthesize novel thiophene&#8208;modified self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated hole&#8208;selective molecules, namely (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;TPCP), affording UV&#8208;stable high&#8208;efficiency PSCs. Simultaneously incorporating phenyl and thiophene groups enhances molecular conjugation, effectively protecting the fragile bonds between the carbazole core and the phosphonic acid group. This modification results in enhanced intrinsic UV stability and improved hole transport ability of the molecule. Furthermore, thiophene grafted on the carbazole coordinates with the Pb2+ ions in perovskite, enhancing the binding of perovskite to hole&#8208;selective molecules. Consequently, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is significantly improved, along with decreased defect density, thereby inhibiting its degradation under UV light illumination. By introducing methyl groups, the molecular stability is further enhanced, and the energy level of Me&#8208;TPCP is finely tuned, resulting in a lower interfacial energy barrier that facilitates more efficient hole extraction. With these advantages, inverted PSC devices based on Me&#8208;TPCP achieve a significantly higher efficiency of 25.62% than the control devices (23.85%). Meanwhile, these devices demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in UV stability, as well as improved operational and thermal stability.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D COFs)&#160;was developed with a cyt topology, facilitating the uniform dispersion and full exposure of distinct metal sites. The resulting TAPP&#8208;OFPc&#8208;COFs demonstrate exceptional electrocatalytic performance in urea oxidation. The Fe&#8211;Ni bimetallic sites synergistically ensure high efficiency and cycle stability.








Abstract
Porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile scaffolds for developing high&#8208;performance photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts. By enabling precise anchoring of metal species onto their cores, these COFs allow for meticulous tuning of chemical and electronic properties, facilitating single&#8208;atom distribution and achieving outstanding catalytic performance. However, the majority of these COFs are restricted to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures, where the catalytic activity of the metal centers is often compromised due to eclipsed stacking layers, limiting their optimization potential. To address this challenge, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with a cyt topology. This innovative structural arrangement facilitates the atomic&#8208;level distribution of distinct metal species across steric exposed networks, and the synergistic effect of bimetallic sites leads to exceptional electrocatalytic activity in urea oxidation reactions with a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at just 1.37&#160;VRHE. This study not only broadens the topological diversity of 3D COFs but also establishes a platform for achieving uniform and accessible multimetal distributions, paving the way for synergistic electrocatalytic materials.

We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene (Ge4CHD) derivative.

Abstract
We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, it undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene derivative (Ge4CHD). Moreover, theoretical calculations on Ge4CHD reveal &#963;*&#8211;&#960; interactions between the two &#960; orbitals (Ge&#9552;Ge) and the CH &#963;* orbital. This interaction is confirmed by a significant red shift in the solid&#8208;state UV&#8211;vis spectrum. In contrast to the behavior in the solid state, the Ge4CHD derivative dissociates in solution into a methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. The resultant 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with S8 to form a novel cage compound containing three S and two Ge atoms. On the other hand, in the reaction with triphenylphosphine sulfide, the in situ generated 2&#8208;thia&#8208;1,3&#8208;digermabicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivative activated the benzene solvent, leading to the formation of a [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition product. Additionally, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to form a three&#8208;membered ring. Its structural parameters and the results of theoretical calculations indicated the zwitterionic character.

         <title>Operando XAFS Deciphering Dynamic Evolution of Heteronuclear Cu&#8211;Ni From Atomic Sites to Atomic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the intrinsic potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction of Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear sites during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Through operando XAFS and microscopy, we reveal the potential&#8208;driven transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7). The tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs effectively reduce the occupancy of Cu 3d&#8211;C 2p antibonding orbitals, thereby promoting CO2 protonation and significantly accelerating eCO2RR kinetics.








Abstract
Revealing the dynamic evolution of atomic&#8208;level active sites during catalytic reactions is critical for identifying true catalytic centers and optimizing the adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, elucidating the dynamic atomic/electronic transformation mechanisms of metal sites in multimetallic systems and achieving atomic&#8208;level control remains challenging. Here, we report a potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction intrinsic to Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear atomic sites during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and microscopy unveil the transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7) at potentials from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.2&#160;V versus RHE, anchored on porous carbon through N/S coordination. The Cu&#8208;rich evolution reshapes geometric structures of active sites, inducing gradual electron localization, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy of CO2 intermediates as evidenced by operando measurements and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs formed at &#8722;0.9&#160;V reduce the antibonding orbital occupancy between Cu 3d and C 2p states, facilitating CO2 protonation and enhancing eCO2RR kinetics. These findings demonstrate high CO selectivity and catalytic stability, providing fundamental insights into the dynamic reconstruction and catalytic mechanism of atomic&#8208;scale active sites.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Atom La2 Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an ultra&#8208;fast printing technology, we have successfully embedded diatomic lanthanum sites onto a graphene framework, which shows excellent ORR performance. The La2&#8208;N6 configuration structure can effectively reduce the reaction barrier of RDS and promote effective charge transfer, thus enhancing the catalytic process, on which the intermediates and structural evolution were well uncovered by combining advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Rare earth lanthanum element has a large atomic radius, multi&#8208;shell orbital electrons, and Fenton&#8208;like reaction inertia, on which a localized high&#8208;coordination structure can be easily formed for the favorable adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, for single&#8208;atom lanthanum sites, due to the loss of all the outmost s and d electrons, the practically vacuous outmost orbitals are stable but sleepy for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we synthesize a novel dual&#8208;atom La catalyst onto N&#8208;doped graphene (La2&#8208;NG) by a Joule ultrafast heating method, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.893&#160;V for the ORR. The La2&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrates a great open circuit voltage of 1.52&#160;V and a maximal power density of 192&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of the La2&#8208;N6 moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La2&#8208;N6 structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.

         <title>Upconversion Lanthanide&#8208;Based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Multimode Information Encryption</title>

A novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and upconversion luminescence under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+, Tb3+, or Eu3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.








Abstract
Luminescent 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of metal&#8208;organic framework materials expanded in a 2D plane, which have a wide range of applications in fields of optoelectronic devices, sensors, and information storage due to their unique layered structure and excellent optical properties. Currently, research on luminescent 2D MOFs mainly focuses on down&#8208;shifting luminescence, while the exploration of upconversion luminescence remains in its early stages. Herein, a novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and red upconversion luminescence at 660 nm under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. In addition, multimode emitting MOFs with both upconversion and down&#8208;shifting luminescence were further constructed by codoping Tb3+ or Eu3+. Inspired by the layered structure of 2D materials, multilayer stacked 2D MOFs composites were prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation method and upconversion luminescence was realized for the first time by interfacial energy transfer between different components. This strategy not only expands the optical modulation of luminescent 2D MOFs, but also provides new ideas for the construction of multifunctional luminescent materials. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.

This study introduces an N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit&#8208;based strategy to enhance room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), highlighting that 1,1&#8208;DB shows strong RTP property, unlike its isomer 1,2&#8208;DB. The contrast in their performance aids in understanding the relationship between molecular structure and phosphorescence, offering insights for designing and optimizing RTP materials.








Abstract
Achieving pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is of great interest due to their applications in optoelectronics. However, improving RTP in pure organic materials by controlling triplet excitons is challenging due to their complex relaxation processes. Therefore, exploring effective strategies to modulate triplet excitons is crucial. Herein, we propose a N&#9472;B&#9472;N isomerization strategy to enhance RTP performance. Two isomers containing HN&#9472;B&#9472;NH units (B2{1,2&#8208;(NH)2C6H4}2), namely 1,1&#8208;DB and 1,2&#8208;DB, were synthesized to explore their RTP properties. Intriguingly, 1,1&#8208;DB exhibited excellent RTP, whereas 1,2&#8208;DB displayed negligible phosphorescence. The N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit in 1,1&#8208;DB optimizes molecular configuration and interactions, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilizing triplet excitons, which improves intersystem crossing (ISC) and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) while reducing nonradiative decay, thus enabling RTP. Additionally, based on phosphorescence resonance energy transfer, multicolor afterglows were achieved by doping fluorescein into 1,1&#8208;DB. This work not only provides a new class of RTP materials but also offers valuable insights for the discovery and optimization of rational designs in RTP materials, potentially triggering the exploration of new functions and properties within boron&#8208;nitrogen molecular systems.

This work not only provides a new class of RTP materials but also offers valuable insights for the discovery and optimization of rational designs in RTP materials, potentially triggering the exploration of new functions and properties within boron-nitrogen molecular systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azine&#8208;Pyridine Frame Generated Covalent Organic Frameworks and Self&#8208;Polymerized Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a family of azine&#8208;pyridine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that promote proton and electron transport through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. These COFs exhibit thermochromism, self&#8208;assemble into meter&#8208;scale films, and show enhanced heavy metal ion reduction, UV shielding, and battery performance, offering new opportunities in reticular chemistry, environmental science, and energy storage.








Abstract
Engineering covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into industrializable films with inherent functionalities has remained a major challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, through developing skeletal azine&#8208;pyridine conformation, we present an effectual synthetic frame to convert a family of powdery COFs into self&#8208;polymerized COFs films under green and ambient conditions. The active proton tautomerism in our azine&#8208;pyridine frame offers a thermochromism, facilitating self&#8208;polymerization of large&#8208;area COFs films from ca. 10&#160;nm to &gt;30&#160;&#181;m thickness with outstanding chemical stability, industrializable processability, and mechanical strength. More remarkably, our azine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based COFs first display various fresh properties, i.e., up to 1913 and 624&#160;mg g&#8722;1 reducing capacities on ions of Au3+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Au0 and Cr6+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Cr3+, 99.9% UV&#8208;blue light shielding and 97.2% transmissivity of visible lights and 10&#8208;fold increase in Zn battery lifetime. We expect that the azine&#8208;pyridine synthetic frame will serve as a generalizable route to boost the development of reticular chemistry, environmental science, and nano&#8208;electronics.

         <title>Tunable Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Supramolecular Polymers Toward Application in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitherto thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and supramolecular polymerization have been seemingly incompatible phenomena. Herein, we demonstrate multiple resonance (MR) TADF from supramolecular polymers, which can be tuned, by using a supramolecular modulator approach. Further, a supramolecular solubilization strategy allows for the transfer of these properties to aqueous media, highlighting the potential for future application.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) offers great potential for application in light emitting devices and bioimaging. Supramolecular polymers can offer intriguing properties for the same applications, such as stimuli responsiveness and self&#8208;healing owing to their dynamic intermolecular interactions. However, merging the two has remained a formidable challenge, due to the nonplanar geometry of common TADF chromophores. Herein, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a less distorted multiple resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) chromophore connected to a polymerization inducing building block. The obtained supramolecular synthon is capable of assembling in aliphatic solvents due to combined interchromophore interactions and hydrogen bonding. Within the supramolecular ensemble the long&#8208;lived photoluminescence properties of the chromophore are maintained. Further modification of the photoluminescence properties could be achieved by using different supramolecular modulators in a social self&#8208;sorting approach, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of the photoluminescence lifetime and bandwidth. Notably, the extent of intermolecular interactions can switch these assemblies from kinetically to thermodynamically controlled regimes. Finally, we employ this co&#8208;assembly strategy to move from organic to aqueous media highlighting the potential toward biological applications.

         <title>Engineering Unspecific Peroxygenases for Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unspecific peroxygenase from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) has been successfully engineered to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. This biocatalytic process demonstrates high efficiency and selectivity with scalability to preparative levels, expanding the catalytic repertoire and synthetic applicability of UPOs in selective oxyfunctionalization.








Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization. Compared to cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), the catalytic potential of UPOs has been less investigated, largely due to their limited natural diversity and the challenges associated with their optimization through enzyme engineering. In this study, we engineered an UPO from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, a valuable transformation yet to be realized in biocatalysis. Through enzyme engineering, two AniUPO variants, AniUPO&#8208;M3 and AniUPO&#8208;M6, were developed to produce a wide range of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters, achieving up to 97% yield, 4140 total turnover number (TTN), and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio (er). The biocatalytic process operates under mild conditions and is scalable for preparative applications. This study broadens the catalytic repertoire of UPOs and enhances their potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Chirally Chimeric Protein Nanoparticle Vaccines via Mirror&#8208;Image Spy Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates a versatile strategy for creating chirally chimeric protein constructs by merging natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) protein motifs through a combination of L&#8208;sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation and D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8208;mediated ligation. This approach has enabled the development of protein nanoparticle vaccines with improved stability and the ability to elicit potent antibody responses.








Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image proteins and nucleic acids exhibit remarkable biostability and bioorthogonality, offering a promising strategy to enhance the longevity of biological therapeutics. Here, we present a modular approach for constructing complex protein architectures that integrate both natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) motifs. Key to this strategy is the development of D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8212;a chemically synthesized, chirally inverted ligase that enables the efficient conjugation of D&#8208;SpyTag and D&#8208;BDTag. By exploiting the achirality of glycine (Gly), we used L&#8208;sortase to covalently link D&#8208;peptides (e.g., SpyTag or BDTag, bearing an N&#8208;terminal poly&#8208;Gly motif) to L&#8208;proteins (e.g., GFP, VLP&#8208;forming Mi3, or antigens) containing a C&#8208;terminal LPXTG sorting signal. The resulting D&#8208;SpyTagged and D&#8208;BDTagged proteins were further assembled via D&#8208;SpyStapler. This method enabled the construction of chirally chimeric VLP vaccines displaying antigens derived from malaria parasites and coronaviruses in various forms&#8212;recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides&#8212;providing significant flexibility and modularity for vaccine design. The resulting chirally hybrid vaccines exhibited enhanced proteolytic resistance in vitro and elicited potent immune responses in vivo. This study provides a versatile platform for developing long&#8208;acting therapeutics and vaccines.

Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structurally diversity were synthesized by a &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8208;repolymerization&#8221; strategy. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. 








Abstract
The development of innovative poly(ether&#8208;ester)s with perfectly alternating ether and ester functionalities to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. Herein, we prepared a series of enantiopure cyclic thioether&#8208;ester monomers bearing various pendant substituents by a facile &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8221; strategy. The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers will afford stereoregular poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structural diversity. The varieties of substituent size, position and stereo&#8208;configuration provide the opportunity to systematically investigate polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as structure&#8208;properties relationship for the resulting poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. Of note, these polymers can be chemically recycled by either ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or alcoholysis, with high monomer regeneration efficiency. The systematic investigation of substitution effects and structure&#8208;property relationships in this work provides a molecular blueprint for designing novel chemically recyclable polymers with high performance.

         <title>Engineering Crystalline/Amorphous Interfaces for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an amorphous indium&#8208;based catalyst, which could reconstruct into crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of metallic indium under working conditions. Therefore, it can exhibit excellent performance in CO2 electroreduction to formic acid at high current densities. The Faradaic efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to formic acid over the In/In&#9472;OH interfaces reaches 98%, which is a 66.1% increase compared to traditional In2O3. 








Abstract
In the request for carbon neutrality, CO2 electroreduction to high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals, particularly formic acid, has become as a promising approach. However, implementing it on an industrial scale is hindered by the catalyst instability under high current densities and the excessive energy consumption of conventional electrolysis systems. To tackle these challenges, we propose an amorphization strategy to regulate catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions. In particular, an amorphous In&#8208;based catalyst, InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x, was designed and achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 98% at &#8722;800 to &#8722;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction to formate, while maintaining stability for 100&#160;h. Mechanistic studies show that InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x undergoes partial reduction to stable crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of fully reducing to metallic In, enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediate. To improve the economic viability of electrolysis system, a CO2 electroreduction coupled with waste plastics electrooxidation system for formate production was constructed. Compared to conventional electrolysis system, the coupled system reduced energy consumption by 34.7% and increased formate production by 49.7%, offering a more energy&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective approach to CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Radical Photochromism and Photoluminescence via Polymer Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity of polymer matrices not only plays a crucial role in inducing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence by protecting the naphthalene diimide core structure from quenching by oxygen and moisture, but also facilitates the generation of stable anion radicals through photoinduced electron transfer, even in the absence of UV irradiation.








Abstract
While polymer matrices are widely used to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from oxygen and moisture quenching by providing a network that enables long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the influence of polymer polarity on phosphors for stable free radicals with radical luminescence (RL) has not been well studied. In this work, naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives, denoted as NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH (X&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;6), featuring different alkyl alcohol chains, exhibit multi&#8208;responsive and tunable RTP and RL properties through polymer matrix polarity regulation. Experimental results reveal that NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH&#8226;&#8722; anion radicals are generated via not only photoinduction in the excited state but also intermolecular interactions of polar matrix in the ground state. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that polar polymers rich in hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors (e.g., &#9472;NH2, &#9472;NH&#9472;, and &#9472;OH), where electrostatic interactions dominate over dispersion (E/D&#160;&gt;&#160;1), more readily induce anion radicals compared to polar polymers rich in acceptors (e.g., &#9472;CN and &#9472;CO&#9472;), where dispersion interactions outweigh electrostatic effects (E/D&#160;&lt;&#160;1). These derivatives exhibit potential applications in information encryption and volatile amine detection due to their chromic and luminescent properties. These findings offer perspectives on the role of polymer matrix polarity in modulating anion radical behavior, and mechanistic insights into the balance between RTP and RL properties.

         <title>Efficient Electro&#8208;Oxidation of Ethylene to 2&#8208;Chloroethanol on SnO2 Through Dual&#8208;Adsorbate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of chlorine&#8208;participated ethylene oxidation on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode is elucidated. In this process, 92% of 2&#8208;chloroethanol is produced through the dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway, where ethylene directly couples with chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH). 








Abstract
Electrified 2&#8208;chloroethanol synthesis serves as a promising alternative to conventional ethylene oxidation with corrosive hypochlorous acid (HClO) and offers the opportunity for sustainable pharmaceutical production. However, the instability of locally generated HClO and the competing water oxidation largely limit the efficiency of this electrochemical process. Here we report a new reaction pathway involved in the ethylene oxidation toward 2&#8208;chloroethanol, featuring co&#8208;adsorbed chloride (*Cl) and hydroxide (*OH) species on a tin dioxide (SnO2) anode. This dual&#8208;adsorbate pathway favors the efficient ethylene oxidation, giving rise to a large current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for at least 50 h and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 82% for the 2&#8208;chloroethanol product. This work opens an avenue for electrifying the synthesis of important organic molecules via simultaneously modulating the adsorption of multiple active intermediates.

The cooperative actions of anthraquinone ligand with H2O2 generate reactive oxygen species that drive oxidative delithiation with concurrent lithium abstraction and coordination by the ligand, enabling efficient and rapid lithium extraction.








Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively from an industrial&#8208;grade lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) black mass having multiple metal ions is challenging but crucial from an industrial standpoint. However, most of the methods involve harsh conditions and sacrificial reagents, are energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming, and generate secondary pollution. This study presents a lithium selective, ligand&#8208;assisted cooperative approach for the selective leaching of lithium under mild conditions. It is revealed that the synergistic actions of anthraquinone salt (Na2AQAc) and H2O2 generate highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as &#8226;OH, &#8226;O2&#8722;, and 1O2 that facilitate oxidative delithiation supported by spin trapping EPR and quenching experiments. As a result, a phase transition of cathode material and concurrent lithium abstraction by the ligand, forming an octanuclear lithium complex ([Li8(AQAc2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH2)2(H2O)12]4+) in the leachate was observed. Consequently, a leaching efficiency of 97% with over 99% selectivity was achieved under the optimized conditions of 3.5% H2O2 (v/v), 30&#160;&#176;C, 72&#160;mM Na2AQAc, 40&#160;g L&#8722;1 pulp density, and a reaction time of 1&#160;h. A recycling strategy was demonstrated to recover anthraquinone acid, and lithium was separated as high&#8208;purity Li&#8322;CO&#8323;. This method offers the advantages of room&#8208;temperature operation, neutral pH conditions, shorter time duration, minimal reagent usage, and the ability to recycle the reagents.

         <title>Stepwise Acetylene Insertion and Ammonia Activation at a Digallene and Diindene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise insertion of acetylene into the E&#9552;E bonds of digallenes and diindenes is reported. This leads to the selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores. The six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues are Lewis&#8208;acidic and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia, which&#8212;upon heating&#8212;undergo ammonolysis releasing ethylene.








Abstract
Sequential [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between acetylene and the digallene and diindene compounds (ETer)2 (E&#160;=&#160;Ga, In; Ter&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Dipp2&#8208;C6H3; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) are described. Careful control of the reaction conditions leads to selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores, respectively. A structural analysis of the heterocycles by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests limited electronic delocalization within the rings, which is borne out in their reactivity. For example, the six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues exhibit Lewis&#8208;acidic behavior and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia. Upon heating, these adducts transform into the corresponding bimetallic triel amides with concomitant generation of ethene.

         <title>Regioreversed Carbosulfenylation of Fluoroalkenes via Nickel&#8208;Mediated Radical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed unconventional 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of fluoroalkenes provides efficient access to sulfide and fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing products. Preliminary mechanistic studies support a pathway involving thiyl radical generation via HAT, addition to the alkene, and subsequent nickel&#8208;mediated benzylation.








Abstract
Carbosulfenylation of olefins represents an important class of reactions for the synthesis of structurally diverse organosulfur compounds. Previous studies typically yield 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity. In the context of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis, accessing the regioreversed products is desirable, significantly broadening the scope of these reactions. In this study, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, using free thiols and benzyl bromides as sulfur and carbon sources, respectively. The unusual regioselectivity observed is enabled by a &#8220;radical sorting&#8221; mechanism. The Ni catalyst activates benzyl bromide to generate a benzylic radical that undergoes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the thiol to form a sulfur&#8208;centered radical. The sulfur radical subsequently adds to the fluoroalkenes, resulting in an &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl C&#8208;radical. This radical undergoes SH2 with a Ni&#8211;CH2Ar to form a C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and quaternary center, ultimately producing valuable fluoroalkyl thioethers. Isotopic labeling experiments corroborate a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event within the working mechanism.

In this work, we construct a highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient CEI based on a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for stabilizing Li||NCM94 battery at high voltage (4.8&#160;V) and extreme temperatures (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries attract great interest, but their poor safety and cycling performance hinder their applications, especially with high cut&#8208;off voltage nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature, and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for Li|| LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) batteries with excellent cycling performance through constructing highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). Such CEI exhibits a gradual decrease in C&#9472;F and a gradient increase in LiF and LiBxOy from the outside to the inside, which effectively inhibits structural degradation of the NCM94 cathode. With an excellent CEI, Li|| NCM94 batteries show outstanding cycling stability and wide temperature applicability (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C). The battery could exhibit a capacity retention of 87% after 200 cycles at 4.8&#160;V, and deliver 112% (or 56%) of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at 60 &#176;C and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, as&#8208;constructed 7.6&#160;Ah pouch cell could run 145 cycles with an energy density of 541&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work provides the guidance on designing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces for wide&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Modular Access to P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of (Thio)Phosphonic Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy using newly modified chiral PIM ligands enables modular access to diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with high stereocontrol. This approach tolerates broad functionality, constructs challenging P&#9552;S motifs, and enables late&#8208;stage nucleoside derivatization, providing a versatile platform for drug and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutic development.








Abstract
Chiral phosphorus(V) centers&#8212;particularly those bearing fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted frameworks&#8212;are key stereochemical motifs in pharmaceuticals, nucleic acid therapeutics, and functional materials. However, their stereoselective construction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy enabled by rationally engineered PIM ligands that affords broad and modular access to structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds. By harnessing the tunable Lewis acidity and well&#8208;defined chiral environment of the catalyst&#8212;together with the distinct mechanistic features of chiral Lewis acid catalysis&#8212;this strategy overcomes the substrate scope limitations that have constrained traditional approaches. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and delivers high levels of stereocontrol across seven distinct substitution patterns, including the efficient construction of chiral P&#9552;S motifs previously considered synthetically challenging. Importantly, the approach enables efficient late&#8208;stage derivatization of nucleosides and their analogs, thereby providing a general entry point to stereodefined P(V)&#8208;containing bioactive molecules. This work not only expands the utility of transition&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis in phosphorus chemistry, but also establishes a versatile framework for applications in drug discovery and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics where precise stereochemical control is essential.

         <title>Electrocatalytic C&#9472;S Cross&#8208;Coupling via Engineered Frustrated Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs for High&#8208;Efficiency Methanesulfonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that MOFs catalysts with Lewis acid&#8208;base sites generated by introducing specific ligand groups can produce methanesulfonate through nucleophilic attack, and performance is superior to previously reported copper&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of the Lewis acid and base sites for electrocatalytic C&#9472;S coupling reaction and provides an avenue to produce by abundant resources and renewable electricity.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of sulfonyl compounds under mild conditions remains a significant challenge due to the reliance on harsh reagents, high energy consumption, and low selectivity in conventional methods. Herein, we report a novel strategy for efficient C&#9472;S bond formation through in situ modulation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs within a copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CuBDC&#8208;XN). By precisely engineering electron&#8208;deficient Cu Lewis acid sites and electron&#8208;rich XN&#8208;functionalized Lewis base sites, this bifunctional catalyst enables the synergistic co&#8208;reduction of SO32&#8722; and CO2 into methanesulfonate (MS) at ambient conditions with a Faradaic efficiency of 13.77% (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus RHE). Mechanistic studies reveal that the frustrated Lewis pairs selectively stabilize key intermediates (*CHO and SO32&#8722;) via electrostatic interactions, facilitating nucleophilic attack and C&#9472;S coupling with a reduced energy barrier (0.48&#160;eV). In situ spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations further elucidate the dynamic adsorption&#8208;configuration regulation and intermediate evolution pathway. This work not only establishes a molecular&#8208;level understanding of cooperative Lewis acid&#8208;base catalysis but also provides a universal design principle for the sustainable electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added organosulfur compounds.

         <title>Dual Chemical Scissors Strategy Enables 1D Antimony Selenates with Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III)&#8212;were successfully designed and synthesized via dual chemical scissors strategy. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong SHG response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for UV NLO applications.








Abstract
The rational, function&#8208;driven design of advanced inorganic functional materials remains a significant challenge, primarily attributed to their inherently complex and highly connected 3D frameworks of most oxide&#8208;based systems. Herein, we report a &#8220;dual chemical scissors&#8221; strategy that synergistically combines the effects of fluoride ions and stereochemically active lone pairs to precisely modulate local coordination environments and enable controlled dimensional reduction. Using this approach, we successfully synthesized the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III). These compounds feature well&#8208;defined helical chain structures constructed from SbOxFy polyhedra and SeO4 tetrahedra, resulting in pronounced optical anisotropy and robust nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for ultraviolet NLO applications. This work establishes a powerful and generalizable structural design paradigm for constructing polar low&#8208;dimensional architectures and underscores the effectiveness of targeted coordination modulation in advancing high&#8208;performance optical materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation in Porous Organic Cage Salt&#8211;Metal Cluster Hybrids for Efficient Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalytic system based on a pH&#8208;responsive porous organic cage salt hybrid has been engineered, where Pd clusters are confined within the cage cavities and radical sites are located on the cage skeletons. Spatiotemporal regulation, combining pH&#8208;stimuli with spatially isolated active sites in proximity, maximizes cooperative performance and enables efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.








Abstract
Developing artificial biomimetic catalysts with precise spatiotemporal control remains challenging. Here, we present a pH&#8208;responsive organic cage salt containing quaternary ammonium moieties ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8208;12X, X&#9552;Cl or Br counteranions) as a platform for constructing such catalysts. Thermally induced electron transfer from counteranions to ammonium moieties generates radicals throughout cage skeletons ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X), which, combined with nanocavity confinement, facilitates metal precursor reduction and Pd cluster encapsulation, yielding the hybrid catalyst, Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X. The pH&#8208;responsive cages enable switching between two catalytic states: Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X, where radicals serve as active sites while Pd accessibility is hindered by numerous counteranions, and Pd@A&#8208;Cage, where neutralization of ammonium cages to non&#8208;radical amine cages (A&#8208;Cage) restores Pd accessibility by removing counteranions and modulating Pd surface charge. This dynamic switching allows real&#8208;time modulation of site&#8208;specific activity in single&#8208;step reactions. Sequential activation of dual active sites by acid&#8208;base stimuli enables tandem catalysis. Moreover, fine&#8208;tuning the protonation degrees of quaternary ammonium groups with base stimuli unveils an optimized catalyst, Pd@[PQA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;6X (where PQA&#8208;Cage refers to partially quaternized ammonium cages). Such a spatiotemporal control maximizes cooperative performance by balancing spatially isolated radicals and Pd sites for efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of incompatible oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.

         <title>Blood Retention and Kidney Clearance of Renal&#8208;Clearable Gold Nanoparticles Strongly Correlate with Renal Injury Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury model, proximal tubular injury&#8212;rather than glomerular leakage&#8212;predominantly determines the renal clearance of gold nanoclusters. The blood retention of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; strongly correlates with proximal tubular injury biomarker KIM&#8208;1, highlighting its potential as a sensitive exogenous blood marker for proximal tubular injury.








Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are typically filtered through the glomeruli and transported along the renal tubules before entering the bladder. However, the effects of glomerular leakage and tubular injury, two common features of kidney diseases, on nanoparticle transport remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the blood retention, kidney accumulation, and renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; in a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model. By correlating its transport with proteinuria and urinary kidney injury molecule&#8208;1 (KIM&#8208;1), endogenous biomarkers of glomerular leakage and proximal tubular injury, respectively, we found that glomerular leakage, as indicated by a &gt;50&#8208;fold increase in proteinuria, did not enhance its blood clearance. Instead, tubular injury significantly reduced glomerular filtration, resulting in elevated blood retention, increased kidney accumulation, and reduced renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328;. Moreover, Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; blood retention exhibited a very strong positive correlation with urinary KIM&#8208;1 (Pearson's coefficient r&#160;=&#160;0.90), much stronger than KIM&#8208;1 correlations with conventional glomerular filtration blood markers such as serum creatinine. This suggests that Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; could serve as a sensitive exogenous blood marker of tubular injury, expanding the diagnostic potential of renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles in kidney diseases.

         <title>Communicative Nanomotors Reprogram Cancer Cell Death via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communicative nanomotors respond to elevated ROS in the tumor microenvironment, enabling active communication and selective mitochondrial targeting through non&#8208;covalent surface engineering. Their precise interaction with cells induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and pyroptotic cell death, while chemotactic motility ensures deeper tumor penetration, advancing intelligent cancer therapeutics.








Abstract
Nanomotors offer significant advantages over passive nanoparticles in biomedical applications. However, their potential has been largely restricted to cargo transport, with limited capacity for interaction with biological systems. Here, we present next&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembled nanomotors that not only exhibit chemotactic motility but also actively communicate with cells, reprogramming cell fate by inducing pyroptosis. These nanomotors are designed to respond to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment, triggering nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;driven propulsion and selective mitochondria targeting via triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface engineering. This interaction induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and activation of gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Furthermore, their chemotactic motility facilitates deeper tumor tissue penetration in 3D spheroids, demonstrating their ability to navigate physiological barriers. By shifting the paradigm from motility&#8208;driven to interactive nanomedicine, this study establishes a transformative platform for targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable Poly(ionic liquid) Copolymers Driven by Polar and Dipolar Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation&#8211;anion moieties in poly(ionic liquid) copolymers can modify the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions. Precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing, thus opening pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy harvesting and storage, sensing, actuators, and others. 








Abstract
Commodity aliphatic and aromatic acrylic&#8208;based copolymers self&#8208;heal due to ubiquitous key&#8208;and&#8208;lock, ring&#8208;and&#8208;lock, and fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock van der Waals (vdW) interactions. However, the role of these interactions in the presence of covalently copolymerized ionic liquid (IL) is not known. This study is driven by the hypothesis that covalently incorporated cation&#8211;anion pairs to form poly(ionic liquid) copolymers (PILCs) can perturb inter&#8208; or intra&#8208;chain vdW interactions reflected in mechanical and electrical responses. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a series of PILCs comprising of pentafluorostyrene (PFS) and imidazolium&#8208;based IL monomers with variable&#8208;length aliphatic tails (methyl and butyl). Using a combination of 2D 1H&#8208;1H and 19F &#8208;19F NOESY NMR and FTIR measurements supplemented by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, these studies demonstrate that preferentially alternating/random PILCs topologies facilitate self&#8208;healing. The introduction of cation&#8211;anion moieties modifies the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions and, along with longer aliphatic tails &#9472;(CH2)3CH3 covalently attached to the imidazolium cation, enhances cation&#8208;anion mobility, thus faster recovery from mechanical damage occurs. These findings underline how precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing in PILCs. These insights may open pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy storage and energy harvesting.

         <title>Photoswitchable Catalytic Divergent Synthesis by a Viologen&#8208;Functionalized Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Tetrahedral Cage</title>

We present here a viologen&#8208;functionalized lanthanide&#8208;organic coordination cage with photo&#8208;redox activities, representing the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage.








Abstract
Photoswitchable catalysis presents a significant challenge, particularly in the modulation of reaction pathways. In this study, we describe a redox&#8208;active lanthanide&#8208;organic tetrahedral cage 1, self&#8208;assembled from a viologen&#8208;functionalised ditopic tridentate ligand and Eu(III) ions. Complexation&#8208;induced charge redistribution and spatial rearrangement of ligands in the assembly endow 1 with distinct photochromic properties and redox activities compared to free ligand L. 1 can serve as a photoswitchable catalyst for divergent chemical transformations of various tetraarylborates, giving biaryls and phenols via photo&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction under 365&#160;nm light irradiation, or producing mono&#8208;arene products through catalytic de&#8208;composition process in the absence of light. This work represents the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, paving the way for the design and construction of novel supramolecular edifices with switchable functions.

         <title>Switching Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation Toward Ethanol by Tuning Spin States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) photocatalyst with medium&#8208;spin active sites, in which both the unpaired electrons and eg orbital occupancy allow to selectively generate &#8226;CH2OH intermediates at moderate *OH coverage and promote the C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH, leading to efficient photocatalytic conversion of CH4 to ethanol without the addition of strong oxidizing reagents. 








Abstract
The selective oxidation of methane (CH4) has attractive potentials for mitigating global warming and producing value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the efficient generation of multicarbon products such as ethanol remains challenging, due to the short lifetimes and high unpaired concentrations of reactive intermediates (like &#8226;OH, &#8226;CH3, &#8226;OCH3, and &#8226;CH2OH). Herein, we developed a medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst with tunable Fe(III) spin states, which can efficiently photo&#8208;oxidize CH4 to ethanol at ambient conditions. The unpaired electrons in d orbitals of Fe sites allow for efficient adsorption of &#8226;OH, and the eg orbital occupancy enables stabilizing different key carbon&#8208;containing intermediates (&#8226;OCH3 versus &#8226;CH2OH). By balancing those two descriptors, the medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst allows to achieve selective generation of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates with a moderate *OH coverage and subsequent coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH to ethanol. With a light intensity of 100 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and water as a weak oxidant, the Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst exhibited a peak photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol yield of 372 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the use of photosensitizers or sacrificial reagents, which is &#8764;3 times higher than the previously best reported photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol under similar conditions. Our study suggests an attractive potential of converting CH4 to multicarbon products by modulating spin states of the catalytic sites.

     alt="Switching Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation Toward Ethanol by Tuning Spin States"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) photocatalyst with medium-spin active sites, in which both the unpaired electrons and &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital occupancy allow to selectively generate &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH intermediates at moderate *OH coverage and promote the C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, leading to efficient photocatalytic conversion of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to ethanol without the addition of strong oxidizing reagents. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective oxidation of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) has attractive potentials for mitigating global warming and producing value-added chemicals, whereas the efficient generation of multicarbon products such as ethanol remains challenging, due to the short lifetimes and high unpaired concentrations of reactive intermediates (like &#8226;OH, &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &#8226;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH). Herein, we developed a medium-spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst with tunable Fe(III) spin states, which can efficiently photo-oxidize CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to ethanol at ambient conditions. The unpaired electrons in d orbitals of Fe sites allow for efficient adsorption of &#8226;OH, and the &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital occupancy enables stabilizing different key carbon-containing intermediates (&#8226;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; versus &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH). By balancing those two descriptors, the medium-spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst allows to achieve selective generation of &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH intermediates with a moderate *OH coverage and subsequent coupling of &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8226;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH to ethanol. With a light intensity of 100 mW&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and water as a weak oxidant, the Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst exhibited a peak photocatalytic CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol yield of 372 &#181;mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without the use of photosensitizers or sacrificial reagents, which is &#8764;3 times higher than the previously best reported photocatalytic CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation to ethanol under similar conditions.

         <title>Gold and Bismuth Trimetallic Synergistic Redox Catalysis for Non&#8208;Directed C&#9472;H Arylation with Aryl Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear gold catalyzed selective C&#9472;H arylation by using aryl bismuth reagents as the arylation reagents has been developed. The Bi(V) generated in&#8208;situ can oxidize gold(I) to form Au&#9472;Au&#9472;Bi intermediate, where Bi's Z&#8208;type coordination mitigates steric/electronic constraints. This trimetallic strategy outperforms classical C&#9472;C couplings, tolerating silanes, boronate esters, and germanes, thus providing new insights for multimetallic cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
The influence of substituent effects plays an important role on the efficiency and regioselectivity toward C&#9472;H activation of non&#8208;directed arenes. Here, an unprecedented trimetallic synergistic redox catalysis system has been developed to achieve a highly efficient and orthogonal C&#9472;H arylation of non&#8208;directed arenes with aryl bismuth. Both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;deficient aryl bismuth can proceed C&#9472;H arylation readily, thus affording an elegant strategy for the synthesis of challenging electron&#8208;rich and sterically hindered biaryls by means of gold catalysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bi(V) species generated in&#8208;situ from Ar&#9472;Bi(III) and NFSI is not only an arylation reagent but also an oxidant to form a critical Au(II)&#9472;Au(II)&#9472;Bi intermediate (detected by HRMS). Interestingly, the binding Bi&#8208;moiety can modulate the electronic and steric environment of gold center through cooperative interactions, thus promoting the intramolecular transmetallation and reductive elimination. In addition, the synthetic robustness of this protocol has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiments and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Alkylidene Succinimides Enabled by Weak Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positive correlation between weak noncovalent interactions and the activity of asymmetric hydrogenation was explored through both DFT calculations and experimental studies by modifying the protecting group of the substrate. Based on these findings, an Earth&#8208;abundant nickel catalytic system was developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylene succinimide, demonstrating superior efficiency (4000&#160;S/C, substrate/catalyst) compared to rare metal catalysts (2000&#160;S/C). This system delivered excellent results, achieving up to 99% enantiomeric excess (ee) and 99% yield.








Abstract
The development of asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals presents a sustainable alternative to efficient but resource&#8208;limited rare&#8208;metal systems. However, these catalysts often suffer from low catalytic activity. In this study, through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic experiments, we uncovered a positive correlation between catalyst&#8208;substrate weak noncovalent interactions and catalytic efficiency in the enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides with different N&#8208;protecting groups. The tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) substituent emerged as the optimal choice, significantly enhancing reactivity. This approach enabled the hydrogenation of a wide range of substrates with excellent yields (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99%&#160;ee), achieving a substrate/catalyst (S/C) ratio of 4000&#8212;twice the efficiency of rare&#8208;metal catalysts (S/C&#160;&#8804;&#160;2000) for similar transformations. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the enantiomers revealed that the high stereoselectivity is promoted by stabilizing weak noncovalent interactions in the R&#8208;configured transition state.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioconvergent C&#9472;O Bond Formation for Asymmetric Cross&#8208;Coupling of Allylamines and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of the C1&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligand with copper induced an additional C&#9472;N axial chirality, thereby enhancing stereochemical control in the challenging asymmetric CO2 fixation. This result may establish a new paradigm for developing metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations. 








Abstract
Upgrading abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value organic molecules has garnered broad research interest for decades. Within this domain, catalytic asymmetric synthesis employing CO2 holds great synthetic importance. Although remarkable advances have been made in asymmetric C&#9472;C bond formation using CO2 as a C1 synthon in recent years, the development of incorporation of CO2 as an oxygen source for asymmetric C&#9472;O bond construction remains elusive, presumably due to the formidable challenge of simultaneously addressing enantioselectivity control and reaction efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the first copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#9472;O bond cross&#8208;coupling of allylamines and CO2 in a radical strategy. The key innovation resides in the rational and strategic conversion of C2&#8208;symmetric oxazoline ligands to their C1&#8208;symmetric counterparts, which induces additional C&#9472;N axial chirality after coordination with copper. The resultant enantioenriched fluoroalkylated 2&#8208;oxazolidones can be further transformed into diverse functional compounds, including novel chiral amino alcohols for oxazoline ligand design and a potent bioactive insecticide analogue. Detailed mechanistic investigations elucidate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway and establish the critical role of C1&#8208;symmetric ligands in achieving efficient stereochemical control.

         <title>A Polyaromatic Metallotube With a Dual Multi&#8208;Functionalization Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyaromatic metallotube, formed from PtCl2 and bispyridine ligands, undergoes dual multi&#8208;functionalization via substitution on the metal hinges. The first multi&#8208;functionalized Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility as well as binds one molecule of fullerene C60, which is subsequently released through the second multi&#8208;functionalization, in a quantitative fashion. 








Abstract
Post&#8208;functionalization is an advanced, key synthetic method in supramolecular systems, whereas the previous method relies heavily on the substitution on the organic frameworks. Here we report a polyaromatic metallotube capable of dually multi&#8208;functionalizing the metal sites in an efficient post&#8208;assembly fashion. The Pt(II)&#8208;linked tube with tetrachloro groups is prepared from two PtCl2 hinges and two bent bispyridine ligands in high yield. The new metallotube efficiently converts to tetra&#8208;substituted tubes by the first multiple functionalization, through the replacement of the chloro groups with various alkynyl groups. The tubular structures before/after the functionalization are unequivocally confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. A resultant tetraammonium&#8208;attached Pt(II)&#8208;tube exhibits high water solubility and uptake abilities toward spherical and rod&#8208;like compounds. The metallotube strongly binds one molecule of fullerene C60 in the polyaromatic cavity yet releases it through the second multi&#8208;functionalization by tetrabromination of the metal hinges in a quantitative and reversible manner. Even after Bingel reaction within the tube, sterically demanding bis&#8208;substituted fullerenes (&gt;&#8764;80% selectivity) are readily released by the second functionalization. The present method, i.e., the use of simple PtCl2 hinges, will be applicable to wide&#8208;ranging metallo&#8208;supramolecules to enhance their structural and functional versatilities via post&#8208;multi&#8208;functionalizations.

&lt;p&gt;A new polyaromatic metallotube, formed from PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and bispyridine ligands, undergoes dual multi-functionalization via substitution on the metal hinges. The first multi-functionalized Pt(II)-tube exhibits high water solubility as well as binds one molecule of fullerene C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, which is subsequently released through the second multi-functionalization, in a quantitative fashion.

         <title>&#8220;Outside&#8208;in&#8221; Design of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Linking Specific Peripheral Geometry to Defined CO2 Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; strategy for the design of NC&#8208;supported Fe and Ni SACs for CO2RR. Combined DFT calculations and experimental studies show that incorporating specific six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings into the outer shell retrofit the electronic property of coordination N atoms in the inner shell, thereby precisely controlling the catalytic performance of the metal center.








Abstract
The regulation of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) through microenvironment engineering, particularly via peripheral species, has recently garnered significant attention in the fields of materials science and heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, establishing unambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships for SAC, especially concerning peripheral effects, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy for the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Fe SACs for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal that installing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring in the outer shell modulates the electronic properties of the inner&#8208;shell coordination N species, altering their electron transfer capabilities while fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;p coupling between the Fe center and adjacent N atoms. Notably, five&#8208;membered rings induce stronger d&#8208;p coupling compared to their six&#8208;membered counterparts, leading to a higher Fe valence state. This electronic modulation optimizes the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (COOH* and CO*), enhancing catalytic performance for CO production.&#160;Extensive experimental studies corroborate these theoretical findings. The proposed &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; design strategy can be extended to Ni SACs, offering new insights into the exploration of highly efficient single&#8208;atom centers through peripheral geometric effects.

         <title>The Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster of Bacterioferritin&#8208;Associated Ferredoxin (Bfd): a &#8220;Biological Fuse&#8221; that Prevents Oxidative Damage to Cells?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When cellular iron is low, bacterioferritin (Bfr) releases its stored iron through a reductive process dependent on the [2Fe&#8211;2S] ferredoxin Bfd. Why accessing stored iron should depend on an iron&#8208;requiring protein when iron is scarce is unclear. Here, we show that the Bfd [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster is sensitive to oxidative stress, suggesting that it may act as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221;, shutting down iron release under conditions where free iron is toxic.








Abstract
Iron is in an essential micronutrient in living systems. However, it is also potentially toxic and so the concentration of chelatable iron within cells is tightly regulated to prevent catalytic formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferritins play a key role in iron homeostasis by storing excess iron as an insoluble ferric mineral within the protein. When bacterial cells become iron deficient, this store may be accessed by reduction/solubilisation of the iron. Bacterioferritins utilise heme, bound at an inter&#8208;subunit site, to support electron transfer to the stored mineral. Electrons for heme reduction are shuttled from NADPH via Bfd, a [2Fe&#8211;2S] cluster&#8208;containing ferredoxin. This raises the paradox that the synthesis of an iron&#8208;dependent protein co&#8208;factor is required under conditions of iron&#8208;deficiency so that stored iron can be utilised. Here, we show that exposure of Bfd to ROS suppresses the capacity of the protein to stimulate iron release from bacterioferritin. We propose that reliance of iron release on Bfd evolved to ensure that chelatable iron levels do not increase under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, the Bfd iron&#8211;sulfur cluster functions as a &#8220;biological fuse&#8221; in providing a fail&#8208;safe that immediately halts iron release once ROS accumulate to damaging concentrations.

         <title>Efficient Separation of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Products Using a Robust Polycatenated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed using an expanded aromatic tricarboxylate ligand, featuring the highest degree of catenation among known HOF analogues and enabling efficient C3H6/C2H4 separation with record productivity for this class of materials. 








Abstract
The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process produces mixtures of ethylene and propylene, driving demand for high&#8208;performance separation materials. We present HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework built from an expanded BTB (4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl&#8208;tribenzoate) linker, featuring the highest catenation degree observed in BTB&#8208;based HOFs. This unique architecture confers good stability under solvent, pH, and thermal conditions. With optimally sized pores and aromatic&#8208;rich surfaces, HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 demonstrates excellent propylene/ethylene separation potential, outperforming its parent frameworks (HOF&#8208;BTB and HOF&#8208;BTB&#8208;NH2) under ambient conditions. Notably, the material accomplishes single&#8208;cycle purification of high&#8208;purity ethylene (99.95%) and propylene (99.5%) from equimolar binary mixtures, achieving a record ethylene productivity of 3.22&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 among HOF adsorbents. This study not only establishes HOF&#8208;ZJNU&#8208;3 as a benchmark HOF material for MTO product separation but also advances the structural design of HOFs for industrial olefin purification.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Boosts the Uptake of Small Molecules in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the importance of chalcogen bonding in improving the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. The uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells through macropinocytosis pathway.








Abstract
Chalcogen bonding, a noncovalent interaction between the chalcogen atom (S, Se, and Te) and Lewis base, plays crucial roles in catalysis, anion recognition, protein confirmation, enzyme activity, and drug design. Herein, we show that chalcogen bonding can be used as a driving force to enhance the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. A systematic investigation using several chalcogen&#8208;containing fluorescent molecules reveal that the cellular uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells. This study suggests that the biological activities of chalcogen&#8208;based compounds may depend not only on their chemical reactivity but also on their chalcogen bond forming ability with the cell membrane.

&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen bonding, a noncovalent interaction between the chalcogen atom (S, Se, and Te) and Lewis base, plays crucial roles in catalysis, anion recognition, protein confirmation, enzyme activity, and drug design. Herein, we show that chalcogen bonding can be used as a driving force to enhance the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. A systematic investigation using several chalcogen-containing fluorescent molecules reveal that the cellular uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells. This study suggests that the biological activities of chalcogen-based compounds may depend not only on their chemical reactivity but also on their chalcogen bond forming ability with the cell membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of a Linear Tetraboron Cation via Deprotonation of a Nonsupported Dimeric Hydroborylborenium Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonation of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion results in formation of a linear tetraboron cation. This homocatenated boron species can activate H2, leading to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. 








Abstract
The nonsupported B&#8211;H&#8211;B moiety of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion can be readily deprotonated by 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, affording a H&#8208;bridged linear tetraboron cation. The resulting tetraboron cation shows diverse reactivity with small molecules. Treatment of this tetraboron cation with H2 leads to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. Additionally, during the preparation of the hydroborylborenium, an unprecedented formal boryl cage&#8208;walking was observed. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this process involves consecutive activation of carboranyl B(9)&#8211;H bonds.

         <title>Decoupling Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation: A Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Assisted Dual&#8208;Site Synergy Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy mechanism is demonstrated to overcome the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru single sites drive selective CO&#8322;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, while Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply H species to Ru single sites via spillover over N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, achieving 98.0% CO selectivity with ultrahigh activity (3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The persistent trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity remains a critical barrier to efficient CO2 valorization. Herein, we propose a concept of decoupling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the photothermal catalytic reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy. This concept is demonstrated through a hybrid catalyst constructed by immobilizing abundant Ru single sites and trace Ru clusters onto high&#8208;efficiency photothermal support of N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages (hNCNC). Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#9472;N4 sites are highly active and selective for the RWGS reaction, contingent on the efficient migration of dissociated *H species to adjacent C atoms of Ru. Importantly, we experimentally confirm that Ru single sites dominate CO2 hydrogenation to CO, whereas Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply hydrogen species to adjacent single sites via spillover over hNCNC. Leveraging this synergistic interaction, the hybrid catalyst achieves an exceptional CO production rate of 3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity over 98%. This mechanism shows universal applicability as demonstrated by the effective promotion of CO2 hydrogenation of Ru single sites by other typical hydrogen&#8208;spillover&#8208;active metal clusters, e.g., Pt and Pd clusters. This design concept liberates the potential to overcome the longstanding activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Active Edge Sites Engineering on Amorphous Co&#8211;Mn Spinel&#8208;Based Oxides for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general synthesis approach is presented to prepare Turing&#8208;type porous CoMn2O4 nanoreactors, facilitating the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, thereby promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways.








Abstract
Rational modulation of edge active sites in the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers, is a hot topic in the heterogeneous catalysis field, yet the applicability of large&#8208;scale manufacturing remains a severe challenge. Herein, a general wet&#8208;chemical approach is reported to large&#8208;scale prepare porous CoMn2O4 with abundant active edge sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like activation without using a template or heat treatment. The obtained Turing&#8208;type structure not only can be assembled into spatially restricted domain CoMn2O4 nanoreactors but also greatly facilitates the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies in promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways and maintained a degradation rate of 99.8% within 5 min after seven&#8208;cycle runs. Moreover, the application prospect of the PMS&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like process for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment, including sulfadiazine (SD) antibiotics in real river water and real pharmaceutical wastewater, was demonstrated by the fixed&#8208;bed tower reactor and the in&#8208;situ floating water treatment device. This work will provide guidance for the development of low&#8208;cost and efficient heterogeneous PMS&#8208;activation catalysts through rational defect engineering.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dominated Calendar Aging in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 34, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;dominated plating morphology governs the calendar aging of aqueous zinc metal batteries. Notably, corrosion severity does not directly correlate with aging&#8208;induced degradation. Electrolytes that promote smoother zinc deposition, quantified by a lower plating roughness factor (Prf), exhibit enhanced resistance to calendar aging. Leveraging this insight, an acetatization strategy achieves up to a 49&#8208;fold reduction in calendar aging&#8211;induced degradation.








Abstract
Zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. While the majority of current research focuses on cyclic aging, the impact of calendar aging on zinc anodes has received far less attention. Here, we reveal that zinc deposition morphology, governed by anion chemistry, plays a decisive role in calendar degradation by amplifying interfacial corrosion and accelerating &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc accumulation. Notably, intrinsic corrosion rates alone do not predict degradation severity; for instance, triflate anion shows low corrosion but induces highly porous deposits and rapid aging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49&#8208;fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6&#160;h aging intervals per cycle), practical anode&#8208;free Cu||ZnI2 cells (ca. 3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000&#160;h. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of zinc anode degradation and offer a viable route to address calendar aging in ZMBs.

         <title>Accessing Metal&#8208;Containing Species in Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Precursor Solutions via Molecular Strategies Guided by the Hard&#8211;Soft Acid&#8211;Base Principle</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular strategies guided by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base (HSAB) principle enable precise control over metal&#8208;based species in perovskite precursor solutions. This approach enhances the quality of narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.26&#160;eV) mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite films and improves the performance of the resulting solar cell devices.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221; Lewis acid characteristics of Sn2+ and Pb2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal&#8208;containing species in mixed&#8208;metal tin&#8211;lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn2+&#8208;based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb2+&#8208;based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95&#160;eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 &#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Emission of Congruently Melting Iodocuprate Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids based on a 2D or 1D CuI2&#8722; iodocuprate network, which have low congruent melting temperatures allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films, exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission: upon excitation at high energy (inorganic network) a strong yellow emission of STE type occurs, whereas upon excitation at low energy (organic component), a red emission originating from iodide vacancies (&#9633;(I&#8722;)) is observed.








Abstract
In the context of the emergence of metal halide perovskites for optoelectronic materials, the lead&#8208;free and earth&#8208;abundant copper(I)&#8208;based halide hybrids are of high interest. Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO2C(CH2)n&#8208;1NH3)CuI2 (n&#160;=&#160;3, 4) exhibiting excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D&#8208;C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge&#8208;sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D&#8208;C3) and in the metastable n&#160;=&#160;4 (1D&#8208;C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D&#8208;C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid&#8208;gap states. The emission of 2D&#8208;C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D&#8208;C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor&#8208;converted&#8208;LED based on 2D&#8208;C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.

         <title>Hooked for Decay with Hydrophobic&#8208;Coated Magnetic Beads to Grapple and Disintegrate Nanoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid catalysts based on the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which is conjugated with a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda cofactor, were immobilized on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The immobilized biohybrid catalysts catalyzed a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to form a hydrophobic polynorbornene film. These film&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited bifunctional activity toward both capturing of nanoplastics and degrading of styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber nanoparticles.








Abstract
Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH&#8208;cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS&#8208;COOH500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 &#177; 0.29&#160;g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH&#8208;cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C&#9552;C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Frictionless Ion Transport Battery Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of covalent organic framework quantum dots has been developed to optimize the electrolyte to achieve near&#8208;frictionless ion transport and high electrochemical performance in Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
Optimization of electrolyte with enhanced energy density and durability in battery system is highly demanded yet challenging owing to the high ion transport resistance and complex by&#8208;reactions in electrolyte. In this work, we tailored the solid&#8211;liquid phase transport interface by adding covalent organic frameworks quantum dots (COFs QDs) into electrolyte. COFs QDs with abundant lipophilic ether&#8208;oxygen groups and &#8764;12&#160;nm nano&#8208;size can serve as myriad ion&#8208;transport nano&#8208;engines for constantly replenishing the interface with Li+ to achieve near&#8208;frictionless ion transport (tLi+&#160;=&#160;0.98) and exceptional stability (&gt;400 days). Lithium&#8211;sulfur battery based on COFs QDs shows high discharge specific capacity of 1063.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#160;C and maintains a low overpotential (&#8764;16&#160;mV) over 4000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 in Li//Li symmetric battery. A Li&#8211;S pouch battery has also been successfully assembled to validate the practicality. Our results may promote the development of COFs QDs in energy storage field.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrate over Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Dual Atomic Active Site and Nanostructure Synergy Enhances C&#8211;N Coupling for Urea Production</title>

         <dc:description>
A bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework with nanoflower&#8208;like architecture is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for urea synthesis. The synergy between dual atomic active sites and nanostructure engineering enables an excellent performance with a urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 via photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrate.








Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 (NitRR&amp;CRR) offers a sustainable approach for urea synthesis and environment remediation. However, there is a lack of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Herein, we report a nanoflower&#8208;like bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework superstructure (Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF, TCPP&#160;=&#160;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) as an efficient NitRR&amp;CRR photocatalyst for urea production. Systematical investigations have revealed that the Cu and Co centers serve as the active sites for driving NitRR and CRR, respectively. The high pore volumes of nanoflower architecture can improve the light adsorption, promote the reactant enrichment, and intermediate generation. Consequently, the C&#8211;N coupling process over Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF is facilitated with reduced energy barriers and inhibited side reactions, resulting in an unprecedent urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents. This study provides new insights into the design of advanced photocatalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Fe Atom to Boost Surface Reaction Kinetics Toward Robust Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration to a medium&#8208;spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS in PHE.








Abstract
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration (LS) to a medium&#8208;spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn2S4), which delivers an impressive H2 evolution rate of approximately 31&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.

         <title>Solvent Polarity Triggered Rapidly Reversible Quadruple&#8208;Mode Luminescence Adjustment in 0D Hybrid Antimony Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide demonstrates quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switching with a rapid response (&lt;1s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805;100 cycles) triggered with moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. The solvochromism mechanism links luminescence tuning to solvent polarity, with dipole moment changed from moderately&#8208;polar solvents, and phase transformation induced by strongly&#8208;polar solvents. This crystal shows potential for solvent detection, safety monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimension (0D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides are highly attractive as smart responsive luminescent materials, but the multiple&#8208;mode luminescence switch is rarely achieved and intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is unclear. Herein, we report a yellowish&#8208;green&#8208;emitting (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 (Me3BzN: trimethylbenzyl ammonium) single crystal, revealing quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switch with rapid response time (&lt;1&#160;s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805; 100 cycles) when triggered by moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. Significantly, the intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is systematically proposed, of which the reversibly multiple&#8208;mode luminescence tuning is closely related to solvent polarity, the moderate polarity can lead to luminescence redshift from 560 to 670&#160;nm due to the increase of dipole moment for inorganic polyhedron. Besides, the small molecular solvent with strong polarity can insert into crystal and form &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; system, inducing single crystal&#8208;single crystal phase transformation with structural disorder and Sb&#8208;Sb distance variation. Owing to the unique multiple&#8208;mode luminescence adjustment performance, (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 displays potential candidate in solvent detection, safety monitoring and information encryption scenarios. These findings highlight the significance of solvent polarity and molecule volume on the dynamic luminescence adjustment and offer guidance for the development of new smart responsive 0D hybrid antimony halides in advanced optical switchable fields.

         <title>A Facile and Scalable &#945;&#8208;Diimine Platform for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is employed in the facile, rapid, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts (20 catalysts). These catalysts show boosted activity (4.4&#160;&#215;&#160;108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), enhanced thermostability (up to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weight, enabling scalable polyethylene production from plastic to elastomer and wax and oil.








Abstract
The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one&#8208;pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large&#8208;scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50&#160;g&#8208;level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 &#215; 108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3&#8208;fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg&#8208;scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi&#8208;crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax&#8208;like and oil&#8208;like products.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark &#945;-diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post-synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of &#945;-diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in &#945;-diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one-pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large-scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50&#160;g-level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3-fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg-scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi-crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax-like and oil-like products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroelectrochemical Observation of Overlayer&#8208;Induced Charge Carrier Dynamics in Water Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 overlayers on WO3 photoanode enhance photoelectrochemical water oxidation by surface and interfacial engineering. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy reveals photogenerated electron trapping pathway in ionized states driven by band bending. These findings demonstrate how surface properties, PEC performance, and charge carrier kinetics interrelate, highlighting the significance of band bending modifications.








Abstract
Surface and interface engineering is essential for constructing efficient and stable photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO3 photoanode coated with amorphous TiO2 overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO2 overlayers are shown to enhance n&#8208;type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO3 photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space&#8208;charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface&#8208;modified PEC devices.

         <title>Balancing Solvation Ability of Polymer and Solvent in Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Efficient Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tailing the solvation ability of both polymer and solvent, this work establishes a correlation between Li+ coordination, ion transport, and interphase formation in gel electrolytes. A combination of weakly coordinated polymer and lower donor number (DN) solvent enables the gel electrolyte to achieve fast ion hopping and form a robust interphase for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show practical potential in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but their development is hindered by insufficient understanding of Li+ solvation chemistry and its impact on ion transport and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. By regulating the solvation abilities of polymer and solvent, this work explores the relationships between GPE composition, Li+ coordination structures, Li+ transference number, and interphase chemistry. The GPE combining weakly coordinated solvents with strongly coordinating polymer results in strong Li+&#8208;polymer attachment, leading to sluggish ion transport. Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li+&#8208;polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#160;and polymer 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;tridecafluoro&#8208;n&#8208;octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li+ and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li+&#8208;polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li+ transport and anion&#8208;derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5&#160;V LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles. These findings provide valuable insights for further advanced GPE design.

         <title>Ambient Processing of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Modules Enabled by Radical Scavengers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antioxidant strategy is employed to achieve the all&#8208;air preparation of organic solar cells (OSCs) by doping the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH into PDINN. C60&#8208;OH significantly affects the film&#8208;forming process of PDINN and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the stability of PDINN:C60&#8208;OH, an impressive efficiency of 20.22% is attained, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in air&#8208;processed (o&#8208;xylene) OSCs.








Abstract
The pronounced efficiency disparity between ambient&#8208;air&#8208;fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) and nitrogen&#8208;glovebox&#8208;processed devices poses a major obstacle to industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. The instability of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) materials in air undoubtedly affects the carrier transport properties, which significantly reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Here, based on the antioxidant strategy, the stability of PDINN in air is enhanced by doping PDINN with the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH, thereby successfully achieving the all&#8208;air preparation of OSCs. Eventually, the PCE of the air&#8208;prepared green OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:PTQ10:BTP&#8208;eC9 (o&#8208;xylene) achieves 19.35% and 20.22%, respectively, after being optimized by the antioxidant strategy. Moreover, C60&#8208;OH remarkably improves the operational stability of the device in air with a T80 lifetime of over 1060&#160;h, which is higher than that of undoped device (416&#160;h). Furthermore, the PCE of large&#8208;area (25&#160;cm2) modules based on PDINN:C60&#8208;OH attains 16.47%. This study highlights the potential of the antioxidant strategy to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic photovoltaics in air, significantly promoting the development of OSCs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a solvophilic diluent&#8208;modulated electrolyte model for electric field&#8208;insensitive electrolyte chemistry. The electrolyte decouples solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields and maintains Li+&#8208;solvent coordination integrity via mutual hydrogen bonding, enabling remarkable success in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether based electrolytes are promising for the realization of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs). However, the oxidation chemistry of these electrolytes stemming from the disruption to solvent coordination by interfacial electric&#8208;field remains unresolved and challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that reinforcing the interactions between solvent and diluent to decouple solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields could maintain Li&#8314;&#8208;solvent coordination integrity and drastically diminish uncoordinated solvents, thereby increasing electrolyte anodic stability. To realize this concept, we identify a class of solvophilic diluents (SPDs, whose interaction energies with solvent&gt;3.3&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) to strongly anchor diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) solvent at electrified interfaces via mutually reinforcing H(DEGDME)&#183;&#183;&#183;F/O(SPD) and H(SPD)&#183;&#183;&#183;O(DEGDME) interactions and effectively decrease dipole moment of DEGDME (&lt;&#160;2.47&#160;D), creating an electric field&#8208;insensitive solvation environment wherein the O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H bond polarization of DEGDME is dramatically impeded. Remarkably, our designed SPD&#8208;assisted electrolyte mediated by electric field&#8208;insensitive methyl nonafluorobutyl ether exhibits outstanding anodic stability, endowing 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 30&#160;&#181;m Li||2.1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell with 80% capacity retention after 168 cycles&#8208;an improvement over the 90 cycles achieved with a Li friendly electrolyte. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for manipulating interfacial solvation dynamics to unlock high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

This work establishes a mechanistic framework for manipulating interfacial solvation dynamics to unlock high-voltage LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Irradiated Polarized Emission in Mn(II) Bromide Hybrids with Chain&#8208;Like Alignment of Halopyridine and Polar MnBr42&#8722; Units</title>

[3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4] exhibits quasi&#8208;1D chain structure with antiparallel electric dipole alignment, and the corresponding X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Mn(II) halide hybrid crystals possess exceptional emission properties and pronounced anisotropic optoelectronic characteristics, making them highly promising for diverse applications. In this study, we present five structurally distinct Mn(II) hybrids, which either form the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains or a hybrid structure combining both 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains and a quasi&#8208;1D chains. These quasi&#8208;1D chains are composed of polar MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra and halogen&#8208;substituted pyridine ligands. Of particular interest is the mixed&#8208;polyhedral compound [3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4]. It exhibits dominant antiparallel alignment of dipole moment between quasi&#8208;1D chains, while 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains display zero dipole moment. The highly&#8208;distorted MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, it gives rise to a pronounced and fascinating polarization&#8208;sensitive emission. These findings underscore the promising potential of mixed&#8208;polyhedral Mn(II) halide hybrids in polarized photonic applications and provide valuable insights for the rational design of polarization&#8208;sensitive functional materials.

         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron catalytic system for efficient atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of CH2Br2 to alkenes has been developed. This photochemical approach enables facile synthesis of valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds that serve as versatile intermediates for streamlined preparation of oxetanes, allyl bromides, and cyclopropane derivatives through one&#8208;pot or sequential transformations. This breakthrough in CH2Br2 activation under mild conditions advances sustainable halogenation methodologies.








Abstract
An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated iron&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction between CH2Br2 and various alkenes has been developed. This transformation provides direct access to synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds with excellent atom economy under mild reaction conditions. The protocol demonstrates remarkable versatility, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Notably, the obtained 1,3&#8208;dibromo products function as highly versatile synthetic building blocks. Through rationally designed one&#8208;pot multistep transformations, these intermediates can be conveniently converted into structurally diverse derivatives, including oxetanes and allyl bromides, directly from terminal alkenes.

         <title>Freely&#8208;Rotatable Multidentate Molecular Anchor Enables Self&#8208;Adaptive Aqueous Binders for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidentate molecular anchoring strategy was proposed to optimize the binders performance for lithium ion batteries. The BHB possesses a very special molecular rotation properties that can facilitate a multidentate anchoring effect to efficiently withstand the volume change of Si&#8208;based anodes after cross&#8208;linking with the traditional binders.








Abstract
The rational design and synthesis of reliable binders is a big challenge to efficiently mitigate the severe volume change of silicon&#8208;based anodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report a multidentate molecular anchoring strategy to construct a novel self&#8208;adaptive aqueous binder. This binder composes of robust 3D dynamic networks derived from the crosslinking of the freely&#8208;rotatable multidentate molecular anchor (2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid, BHB) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) via dynamic hydrogen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly, which effectively imparts the fabrication of high&#8208;strength Si/C anodes and achieves high areal capacities (6.13&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2) under a high mass loading of 13&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the dynamic and reversible adhesion and the efficient &#8220;net&#8208;to&#8208;point&#8221; bonding characteristic contribute to enhance structural and interfacial stability in the NCM811/Si/C full cells. Consequently, the cells demonstrate superior cyclability and electrochemical performance. Notably, this multidentate molecular anchoring strategy can be further extended to develop other BHB&#8208;derived self&#8208;adaptive binders (i.e., BHB/PVA and BHB/CMC) for the purpose of dynamic structure regulation. This work provides valuable insights into the judicious modulation of aqueous binders from the perspective of molecular chemistry and product engineering, paving the pathway for the design of auqeous binders for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Homogeneous Heterobimetallic&#8208;Oxide Interfaces Enable Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution Passivation for Durable Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulation strategy enables self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on Zn anodes. The design ingeniously blends the hydrolysis of SnCl4 and the replacement reaction of In3+ and Cu2+ ions with Zn metal to spontaneously generate the heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and the oxide SnO2. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance and the abundant nucleation sites in acidic media. 








Abstract
Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries hold promising prospects in large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their higher discharge voltage and capacity. However, the challenge of developing long&#8208;term acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries still remains due to Zn anode instability in acidic media arising from the inevitable proton corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on the Zn anode surface via a multi&#8208;cation (Cu2+, In3+, and Sn4+) synergistic regulation strategy to achieve &gt;85.5% depth of discharge with over 1000&#160;h of cycling in strongly acidic medium (pH&#160;=&#160;0.9). The design ingeniously blends the SnCl4 hydrolysis and In3+ and Cu2+ ions replacement with Zn metal to spontaneously generate heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and SnO2 oxide. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance of SnO2 and the abundant nucleation sites of heterobimetallic. Crucially, the in situ hydrolysis of SnCl4 establishes a self&#8208;regulated acidic environment without additional acidic medium. Consequently, Zn&#8211;Mn pouch battery within this acidic environment delivers a high capacity of 1.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 and retains 84.9% of initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This direct multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulated self&#8208;assembly interface strategy holds significant potential for expediting the advancement of high&#8208;safety, large&#8208;scale energy storage technology.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Adaptive Transformations of Flexible Frameworks: From Controlled Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness to Regulated Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two flexible framework conformers (FJI&#8208;H29 and FJI&#8208;H41) were prepared. They not only exhibit different responses to the same stimuli, but their responsive behaviors can also be regulated precisely. FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo thermal&#8208;driven deformations and reconstructions. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy, it can undergo desolvent&#8208;driven controllable deformations, from in situ shrinkage to stepwise shrinkage.








Abstract
Synthesizing enzyme&#8208;like porous materials that can regulate responsiveness through conformations remains a challenge. Here, two flexible framework conformers (FJI&#8208;H29 and FJI&#8208;H41) were prepared from a semirigid ligand. They not only exhibit different responses to the same stimuli, but their responsive behaviors can also be regulated precisely. FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo continuous thermal&#8208;driven transformations, from reversible deformations to irreversible reconstruction, and the reconstruction barrier can be further tuned. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy generated by solvent removal; when the solvents escape vigorously, it in situ shrinks to a more stable conformer (FJI&#8208;H43); when the solvents escape slowly, it first forms a shape maintaining metastable state (FJI&#8208;H41'), then spontaneously transforms into FJI&#8208;H43. Structural analysis shows the FJI&#8208;H29 is mechanically stable, while its ligands undergo more severe distortion with increasing temperature, enabling it to undergo thermal&#8208;driven reconstruction. Whereas FJI&#8208;H41 is mechanically unstable, so it is prone to undergo desolvent&#8208;driven deformations. FJI&#8208;H43 not only exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;open effect for the adsorption of C2H2 and CO2 but can also be used for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixture; but FJI&#8208;H29 does not work. This provides a new strategy for preparing enzyme&#8208;like porous materials.

         <title>Confining the Node Accessibility of Zr&#8208;MOFs Along One&#8208;Dimensional Channels Toward High Water&#8208;Vapor Cycle&#8208;Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle for building Zr&#8208;MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability by deliberately constructing one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels with limited accessibility of Zr6 nodes to water along channel direction was illustrated. Through either shortening or elongating the core of organic linker horizontally, MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability were synthesized. The new resultant Zr&#8208;MOF NJTech&#8208;5 shows one of the highest water uptake amount and working capacity.








Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water&#8208;adsorption&#8208;related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr6 nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr&#8208;MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr6 nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4&#160;&#197; can successfully hinder the introduction of in&#8208;plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr&#8208;MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability. Among them, NJTech&#8208;5 (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with scu&#8208;topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&#8722;1 and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&#8722;1, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.

         <title>Convenient Production of Photothermal Recycling Phosphorescent Materials from Cellulose and Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of RTP films (Cell&#8208;Lig) from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin was achieved within 1 s through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition. Specifically, Cell&#8208;Lig can be readily recycled through light&#8208;controlled phase transitions, and the initial RTP performance was maintained over six cycles of recycling.








Abstract
Developing recyclable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) films using ultrafast fabrication techniques remains a critical yet challenging objective. With this research, we developed an RTP film (Cell&#8208;Lig) through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition, achieving solid film formation within 1 s from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin. The phase transition also generated a confined rigid environment for Cell&#8208;Lig, activating thickness&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent green RTP emission from the incorporated lignin. Furthermore, red afterglow emission using an energy transfer mechanism was realized by incorporating rhodamine B (RhB). The inherent photothermal activity of lignin endowed Cell&#8208;Lig with easy recyclability using light&#8208;controlled phase transitions. Under irradiation, photothermal evaporation of residual ethanol triggered liquefaction (solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition), while ethanol reintroduction facilitated instantaneous hardening. Remarkably, the initial RTP performance was maintained over six recycling cycles. Capitalizing on these attributes, Cell&#8208;Lig was successfully used for advanced coating and security applications.

         <title>Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation Strategy Enables Rapid Discovery of Potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 Interaction Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a novel protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors design strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. Known high&#8208;affinity binders serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221;. As a proof of concept, the potent PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 was discovered for inhibiting the interaction of CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2.








Abstract
Traditional strategies for developing small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) are time&#8208;consuming and often yield low success rates due to the flat and dynamic interfaces of PPIs. To enable the rapid design of highly potent PPI inhibitors, we proposed a novel strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. In this strategy, high&#8208;affinity fragments serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221; to modulate the protein&#8211;protein interaction. As a proof of concept, the potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3, which fits the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; paradigm, was discovered with an IC50 of 32.1&#160;nM for inhibiting the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and cryptic pocket identification were employed, revealing the activation loop (A&#8208;loop) of CDK2 was flexible and targetable. X&#8208;ray crystallography and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX&#8208;MS) analysis showed that LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 indeed bound to and stabilized the A&#8208;loop. LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 effectively inhibited the CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 interaction in CDK2 highly expressed melanoma cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibition of CDK2 mediated signaling. In conclusion, the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; strategy offers a novel approach for PPI inhibitor discovery and could accelerate the development of PPI inhibitors.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Triangular Pore in Single&#8208;Layer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Membrane for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012 pores&#160;per&#160;cm2) are reported. They demonstrate ultrahigh H2 permeance and CO2 permeance as well as good H2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivities, providing a new membrane platform for achieving efficient molecular sieving and understanding nanopore transport. 








Abstract
Single&#8208;layer crystalline films are ideal separation membrane materials because their atomic thickness could yield the highest possible molecular flux once nanopores are generated. However, the development of single&#8208;layer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore structures remains elusive, which makes the realization of efficient molecular sieving and interpretation of molecular transport a difficult task. Herein, we report the fabrication of single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012&#160;pores&#160;per&#160;cm2). The hBN membranes exhibit a H2 permeance of 5.43&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1 with a H2/CH4 selectivity of 14.7; they also show a CO2 permeance of 1.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1, with a CO2/N2 selectivity of 12.3. Importantly, we show that straightforward mathematical modeling can predict and describe the gas transport properties of the hBN, providing new insights into the molecular transport across atomically thin nanopores. The results gained from this study could significantly advance our understanding of molecular transport across hBN nanopores and may promote the development of hBN membranes to address critical separation issues.

         <title>Toward Narrow&#8208;Band, Stable Blue MR&#8208;TADF Emission via Combined Heterocyclic Analogues Marching B.T.2020</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust molecular design strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters via heterocyclic carbazole integration to strengthen weak C&#9472;N bonds was proposed. Blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA have achieved ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs (24/21&#160;nm), high PLQYs (88%/95%), and record&#8208;high EQEs (23%/26%). The tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA OLED achieved LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 for being among the longest for CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10 blue OLEDs, approaching BT.2020 coordinates.








Abstract
The development of efficient and stable ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is critical for next&#8208;generation wide&#8208;gamut OLED displays. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy that enhances emitter stability and efficiency by reinforcing the weak C&#9472;N bonds through selective incorporation of heterocyclic carbazole (Cz) units into the MR framework. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA, were synthesized via high&#8208;yield, lithium&#8208;free borylation. These emitters exhibit pure&#8208;blue emissions at 453 and 463&#160;nm with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21&#160;nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA show emissions at 456&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based device shows an LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10. These results demonstrate a versatile and scalable molecular design strategy for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency, long&#8208;lifetime blue OLEDs approaching the BT.2020 color standard.

         <title>Engineering Anion&#8208;Diluent Matrix for Ion&#8208;Decoupled Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes toward Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a unique anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) formed by amphiphilic zinc salt and diluent is proposed. The locally concentrated Zn2+ and de&#8208;anionized Zn2+ solvation structure reduce ionic transport barriers, yielding a high transference number (0.72). The electrolyte spontaneously segregates into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains that disrupt continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, restricting proton&#8208;hopping, and mitigating parasitic reactions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries suffer from electrolyte&#8208;induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation&#8211;anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion&#8208;decoupled LHCE (ID&#8208;LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;propanol (TFP) as anion&#8208;affinity diluent. The TFP&#8208;mediated anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF&#8722; from Zn2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn2+&#8208;enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water&#8208;deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF&#8722; coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF2&#8208;ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level pouch cells (1.04&#160;Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.

         <title>Dienoic&#8208;Acid Coupling Effect Induced Hierarchical Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dienoic acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in situ construct HSL on Zn anode by the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid additives. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond facilitates the self&#8208;decomposition reaction to form the organic&#8208;rich outer layer and the inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer.








Abstract
Rational pre&#8208;design of self&#8208;decomposed electrolyte additives to construct solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) anode confronts enormous challenges, especially for the in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;function relationship and the lack of reasonable design criteria. In this work, the dienoic&#8208;acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in&#8208;situ construct a hierarchical SEI layer (HSL) through the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid molecules. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond can strengthen the self&#8208;decomposition tendency of trace electrolyte additive to form HSL via chemical and electrochemical reaction. HSL can effectively regulate interfacial H2O environment via hydrogen&#8208;bond anchoring to reduce thermodynamically active H2O, facilitate desolvation kinetics, and uniform Zn2+ diffusion, thus significantly suppressing HER and dendrite growth. As a result, Zn anode with HSL can achieve high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 2400 cycles, long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3800&#160;h, and good reversibility under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full battery with HSL displays a long cycling life of 15&#160;000 cycles and successfully powers the portable and wearable instruments.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanohydrogel&#8208;Based Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Nanozyme for Photocatalytic Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) was prepared by in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on Zn&#8208;porphyrin COF. Compared to bulk COF, it exhibits enhanced oxidase&#8208;like activity and 1O2 generation under visible light irradiation, synergistically boosting bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) via homogeneous catalysis and PNIPAM&#8208;mediated bacterial adhesion, which further accelerates wound disinfection and healing.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble nanozymes have the potential to overcome the limitations of low catalytic efficiency of most heterogeneous nanozymes in aqueous solutions and further expand their applications in the biomedical field, but with significant synthetic challenges. Here we report an oxidase&#8208;mimicking water&#8208;soluble nanozyme based on zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) for photocatalytic antibacterial. The in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on scaffold of Zn&#8208;COF results in the exfoliation of crystalline COF nanosheets and assembly into nanohydrogels in aqueous solution. The obtained Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG can effectively mimic photoresponsive oxidase&#8208;like activity for the chromogenic catalysis of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by facilitating homogeneous behavior to enhance catalytic efficiency, while also exhibiting intelligent temperature&#8208;response regulation of catalytic oxidation activity. Moreover, the high photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reinforcement of binding to the exterior of bacteria through noncovalent interactions concurrently boost its bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) by amplifying oxidative stress. In vivo study on S. aureus&#8208;infected murine model further substantiates the superior wound disinfection and healing effect of Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG. Our work paves a way for the utilization of COF nanohydrogel as a potent antibacterial nanozyme agent and provides a novel platform for the development of biomedical applications.

         <title>Promiscuity in Molecular Mimics of the Cysteine Dioxygenase: Effects of Selenium in the Substrate and Cobalt as the Central Metal Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic model for the cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) was found to be also capable of selectively dioxygenating selenocysteamine, suggesting that the lack of reactivity found for the CDO in combination with selenocysteine originates in the protein matrix. The corresponding cobalt complex mediates the dioxygenation of selenocysteamine, too, and thus represents the first example of a molecular cobalt complex that is potent to activate O2 for the dioxygenation of a substrate.








Abstract
Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [TpMesFe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] and [TpMes*Fe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] (with TpMes&#160;=&#160;hydrotris(3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate, TpMes* = hydrobis((3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)(5&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt&#8208;analogue [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O2 &#8211; as in case of the parent cysteamine&#8208;bound complexes &#8211; the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO&#8208;Sec toward O2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen &#8211; more slowly but selectively &#8211; to give [TpMesCo(O2Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.

         <title>Thermodynamic Feedback Mechanisms for Mitigating Polarization in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a thermodynamic negative feedback mechanism in lithium&#8208;ion battery polarization, demonstrating that regions with steep open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) slope can self&#8208;regulate reaction rate distribution, and proposes a design strategy to mitigate polarization heterogeneity by tailoring the OCV profile, offering a new principle for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is intrinsically determined by the interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, which jointly govern the polarization dynamics across multiple scales. Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions.

         <title>Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted Dual Acid Sites in WO3&#8208;x Catalysts Facilitate Direct Photocatalytic Hydrodeoxygenation of Hydroxy Groups in Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity enhancement strategy has been developed to realize the direct photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of different alcohols under ambient conditions. A WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to drive the whole reaction. The Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites have been&#160;demonstrated to be the main sites for the photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of hydroxy groups.








Abstract
Efficient hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the hydroxy groups (C&#9472;OH) in alcohol molecules has attracted substantial attention due to its importance in many research fields such as organic synthesis and biomass conversion. Photocatalytic C&#9472;OH direct HDO is a promising but challenging process because of the difficulty in C&#9472;O bond activation due to the higher bond energy and strong polarity. A polarity enhancement strategy is proposed and a WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to realize the direct HDO of alcohols under ambient conditions. The C&#9472;O bond is first heterolytic cleaved to produce the carbocation intermediate and then the carbocation will combine with a proton and photogenerated electrons to form a new C&#9472;H bond. The synergistic effect of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites plays a key role in promoting the C&#9472;O bond cleavage. A series of comparative experiments, spectral characterizations&#160;and DFT calculations were&#160;used to demonstrate this new photocatalytic HDO pathway. Different alcohols, including polyols, can be directly converted into corresponding alkanes over this system. The present work discloses a direct HDO process for the hydroxy groups in alcohols and provides a new horizon for the design of new photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Tailored Selectivity for CO and C2+ in CO2 Reduction: Insights into the Dynamic Evolution of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine is introduced as a heteroatom to modulate the structure of copper&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts during electrochemical CO2 reduction. The dynamic surface reconstruction and formation of undercoordinated grain boundaries define the real catalytic sites and affect CO and C2+ product selectivity. This offers a strategy for catalyst design and informs principles for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.








Abstract
Controlling product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is critical for efficient CO2 conversion. However, the dynamic structural changes of Cu&#8208;based catalysts during operation complicate mechanistic understanding. Here, we investigate fluorine&#8208;modified copper pre&#8208;catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO2R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu2&#8314; precursors into metallic Cu&#8304; with distinct local structures. Cu&#8208;F&#8208;4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO2R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 81% at &#8722;0.45&#160;V. In contrast, Cu&#8208;F&#8208;1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FEC2+ of 80% at &#8722;0.65&#160;V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.

         <title>Gamma Ray Radiation Promotes Linker Mixing in Multivariate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time explore a novel and simple route to construct a mixed&#8208;linker&#8208;based multivariate metal&#8208;organic framework (MTV&#8208;MOF) of imidazole&#8208;incorporated zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 by 60Co gamma ray radiation under ambient conditions. Notably, the distinct radiation&#8208;induced activation of the synthesis reaction gives rise to a much higher mixed&#8208;linker incorporation limit in ZIF&#8208;7, up to twice that synthesized by the solvothermal process, further leading to increased flexibility of aperture, higher specific surface area, and notably enhanced separation performances for Kr and Xe.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;linker&#8208;based multivariate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;MOFs) recently received considerable research effort because they exhibit tailored physicochemical properties that are often not possessed by single&#8208;linker MOFs and therefore find unique applications. Relative to the pristine linker, the incorporated linkers may tend to form different topologies, bringing about lattice mismatch and structural disorder. This leads to a low mixed&#8208;linker incorporation limit, and further increasing the linker incorporation rate may disrupt the crystallinity of the parent MOF, resulting in amorphous products or other topologies. Therefore, increasing the linker incorporation rate without changing the structure of the parent MOF represents a challenge. Herein, for the first time, an MTV&#8208;MOF of imidazole&#8208;incorporated zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 is constructed by 60Co gamma ray radiation. Both experiments and theoretic calculations demonstrate that the distinct radiation&#8208;induced activation of the synthesis reaction gives rise to a much higher mixed&#8208;linker incorporation limit in ZIF&#8208;7, up to twice that synthesized by the solvothermal process, further leading to increased flexibility of aperture, higher specific surface area, and notably enhanced separation performances for Kr and Xe. These observations suggest that radiation synthesis may emerge as a general route to a series of MTV&#8208;MOFs with significantly enhanced linker mixing limit and physicochemical properties.

         <title>Kirkendall Effect&#8208;Driven Interface Engineering Facilitates Water Dissociation for Dual&#8208;Site H2O2 Electrosynthesis Simultaneously at the Anode and Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Kirkendall effect&#8208;driven interfacial engineering strategy was developed to construct NiZnOx&#9472;C catalysts with exposed (100) facets. The incorporation of hetero&#8208;nanocluster NiOx induced built&#8208;in electric fields and enriched oxygen vacancies, which synergistically promoted the spontaneous dissociation of water and subsequent formation of *H and *OH radicals. These interfacial features collectively optimized the thermodynamics and kinetics of both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) pathways for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The direct integration of renewable energy into H2O2 electrosynthesis systems offers a promising strategy to minimize energy losses and costs. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy, the dual&#8208;site catalysts must efficiently enable both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR). The Kirkendall effect was employed to engineer interfaces and construct a NiZnOx&#9472;C catalyst with exposed (100) facets. The hetero&#8208;cluster NiOx induces oxygen vacancies and built&#8208;in electric fields, which facilitate water activation and subsequent formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, thereby enabling a single catalyst to rapidly electrosynthesize H2O2 at both the anode and cathode. Notably, 2e&#8722; ORR on the cathode enabled rapid synthesis of high&#8208;concentration H2O2 (33987&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1, 33.18&#160;mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). NiZnOx&#9472;C achieves stable 2e&#8722; ORR/WOR coupling in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor, operating reliably for 4 h under simulated alternating current (AC) and peaking at a total Faradaic efficiency of 150.9% under amperage&#8208;level direct currents. This work provides insights into interface engineering based on the Kirkendall effect, demonstrating the feasibility of directly integrating intermittent renewable energy into H2O2 electrosynthesis systems.

         <title>Localized Hydrolysis&#8208;Based Proximity Reporting Platform for Protein Hierarchical Structure Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a localized hydrolysis&#8208;based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for protein hierarchical structure profiling across diverse biological specimens. LHPR enables quantitative mapping of protein&#8208;specific glycoforms and glycosylation stoichiometry dynamics during physiological transitions. This capability provides a powerful tool for the development of new glyco&#8208;markers and glyco&#8208;intervention&#8208;based personalized treatments.








Abstract
The substrate&#8208;specific bond cleavage capability of hydrolases provides a unique strategy for engineering off&#8208;on switches.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a localized hydrolysis-based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for protein hierarchical structure profiling across diverse biological specimens. LHPR enables quantitative mapping of protein-specific glycoforms and glycosylation stoichiometry dynamics during physiological transitions. This capability provides a powerful tool for the development of new glyco-markers and glyco-intervention-based personalized treatments.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substrate-specific bond cleavage capability of hydrolases provides a unique strategy for engineering off-on switches. This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo-&#946;-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), we developed a localized hydrolysis-based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target-recognizing molecules with NDM-1, and designed click chemistry-reactive, substrate-caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM-1 activity enabled in situ protein-specific imaging of glycans via proximity-dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein-specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein-based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of a Selective YTHDF1 Inhibitor Targeting the m6A Recognition Domain for Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered SKLB&#8208;Y13, a selective YTHDF1 inhibitor that binds to the m6A recognition pocket and disrupts m6A&#8208;dependent YTHDF1&#8211;mRNA interactions. SKLB&#8208;Y13 shows potent cellular activity and selectivity in breast cancer models, with chemoproteomic profiling confirming its high target specificity.








Abstract
As a key N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) reader, YTH domain&#8208;containing family protein 1 (YTHDF1) promotes protein synthesis by recognizing m6A&#8208;modified mRNA, and its abnormal expression is closely related to breast cancer (BC) progression. To date, the scarce reported YTHDF1 inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity and limited potency, primarily due to the high homology of the YTH domain within the YTHDF family, which poses significant challenges for the discovery of subtype&#8208;selective inhibitors. Here, we report SKLB&#8208;Y13, the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitor achieving exclusive targeting of the YTHDF1 m6A&#8208;binding pocket&#160;(IC50&#160;=&#160;0.76 &#181;M), via structural optimization of a novel 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrothieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridine scaffold.&#160;Uniquely, SKLB&#8208;Y13 interacts with YTHDF1&#8208;specific residues Tyr397 and Trp470, as confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and demonstrates improved selectivity for YTHDF1 over YTH family proteins. Cellular and in vivo studies reveal that&#160;SKLB&#8208;Y13 disrupts YTHDF1&#8208;PRPF6 mRNA interaction in an m6A&#8208;dependent manner, thereby impairing the translation of PRPF6 and inhibiting BC proliferation while promoting apoptosis. Chemical proteomics profiling confirms its good target specificity, while pharmacokinetic analysis shows favorable in vivo properties.&#160;This study introduces the first selective YTHDF1 inhibitor, serving as a&#160;novel chemical probe&#160;to elucidate m6A&#8208;dependent oncogenesis and a promising starting point for developing precision therapies against YTHDF1&#8208;overexpressing BC.

         <title>Behavior Regulation of *CO over Self&#8208;Evolution Tandem Catalysts Under Tuned Interfacial Electric Field Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts (Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu) are designed and the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO are evaluated by DFT calculations, COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ characterizations. The research figures out that although strong interfacial electric fields weaken the internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity for *CO is a key factor for C&#8211;C coupling in tandem catalysts.








Abstract
Tandem or self&#8208;evolution Cu&#8208;based catalysts effectively regulate *CO to promote the conversion of CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon (C2+) products. DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared and in situ Raman. The low C2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FEC2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (jc2+) of 553.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C&#8211;C coupling in the *CO&#8208;rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.

         <title>Orbital Rehybridization Enabling Abundant Pentagonal&#8211;Heptagonal Rings in Hard Carbon for Optimal Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constructed pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings induces ripple&#8208;like distortions in the carbon layers of hard carbon. The resulting curvature structures deviate from the sp2 hybridization state, denoting electron abundance at the curvature sites. Such electronic reconfiguration confers hard carbon materials with exceptional sodium storage activity.








Abstract
Curvature structure modulation through the introduction of abundant non&#8208;hexagonal (pentagonal and/or heptagonal) rings results in structural mutation and tuning of the electronic structure of hard carbon. This functional utilization of hard carbon is promising yet very challenging. For instance, in an electrochemical storage system, the curvature effect leads to the formation of structurally defective carbon materials with higher reactivity than pure graphite. Here, we reveal that the introduction of pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings results in partial structural distortion by distorting C&#9552;C bonds in pyrolyzed topologically defective hard carbon (TDC). Theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that hard carbon with abundant pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings forms localized curvature structures. The corresponding changes in electronic properties from the sp2 hybridization state are mainly due to the rehybridization of &#963; and &#960; orbitals. The resulting charge&#8208;rich structure has high reactivity for sodium ion adsorption. Samples with abundant pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings exhibited excellent rate performance and high cycling stability, as indicated by a capacity of 411&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (TDC&#8208;2) after 400 cycles at a current density of 2&#160;A g&#8722;1, in contrast to 212&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 for TDC&#8208;1.

         <title>Predictable Modulation of a Spontaneous Post&#8208;translational Modification in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool is reported for studying methylglyoxal (MGO)&#8208;derived protein glycation by incorporating single amino acid mutations that predictably modulate glycation levels. Mass spectrometry of intact proteins and proteolytic digests reveal Tyr&#160;(or Glu)&#160;substitutions result in an increase&#160;(or decrease)&#160;in site&#8208;specific glycation, enabling precise control of glycation levels in future cellular studies.








Abstract
Glycation is a nonenzymatic posttranslational modification associated with aging and disease. Because it occurs spontaneously, it is extremely difficult to control the extent of glycation at distinct sites within target proteins, especially in cellular systems. Here, we report a chemical approach, referred to as &#8220;dialAGE&#8221;, that enables the site&#8208;specific control of protein glycation. This unique tool requires the introduction of just a single point mutation that modulates the glycation susceptibility of a nearby arginine. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, extensive mass spectrometry analysis was performed to confirm that dialAGE can modulate site&#8208;specific glycation levels at multiple arginine residues in ubiquitin in vitro, enabling both enhanced and diminished glycation. Introduction of dialAGE point mutations and/or glycation with the biologically relevant glycating agent methylglyoxal did not affect polyubiquitin chain formation using in vitro ubiquitination assays. Furthermore, we show that dialAGE can be used to modulate ubiquitin glycation levels in living mammalian cells. We, therefore, anticipate that this method will be particularly useful for enabling the study of glycation as a genuine, functional, and posttranslational modification.

We, therefore, anticipate that this method will be particularly useful for enabling the study of glycation as a genuine, functional, and posttranslational modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Spin Resonance at the Single&#8208;Molecule Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides an overview of the four electron&#8208;spin&#8208;resonance techniques with single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, relying on either optically detected magnetic resonance or scanning&#8208;probe microscopy. After introducing underlying common concepts, it reviews the working principles, experimental conditions and key achievements.








Abstract
Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a widely employed spectroscopic technique for studying systems with unpaired electron spins, such as molecular radicals. Typically, many billions of spins are required to get a detectable ESR signal, which is subject to extensive ensemble averaging. Downscaling ESR to a single molecule allows studying the signatures of each individual molecule separately, applicable to biomolecules in their native environment, for example. Single&#8208;molecule ESR offers several novel research avenues, such as in quantum sensing with a single molecule. Over the last decades, four different single&#8208;molecule ESR approaches have been developed, which rely on either optically detected magnetic resonance or scanning&#8208;probe microscopy. An introduction into these four approaches including their deployment in pioneering works will be provided.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Assisted Tandem Electrocatalysis for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H5OH Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
An Ag@AgCu core@satellites electrocatalyst were designed to reveal the plasmon assisted tandem electrochemical CO2 reduction for high&#8208;selective C2H5OH production. An intensive localized electric field could be excited in the near&#8208;surface region of Ag@AgCu core@satellites under light irradiation, contributing to a high C2H5OH Faradic efficiency of 65.5% at industrial&#8208;level current density (&#8722;280&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in a photo&#8208;electrochemical flow cell. 








Abstract
An Ag@AgCu core@satellites electrocatalyst, structured with AgCu alloyed nano&#8208;islands dispersed at metallic Ag core surface, was designed to reveal the plasmon&#8208;assisted tandem electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) for selective C2H5OH production. As unraveled by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations, the core@satellites microstructure enables the tandem ECO2RR pathway to happen at the interfaced Ag and AgCu sites to facilitate C2H5OH formation, with Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H5OH reaching 61.4% at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Under light, an intensive localized electric field could be excited in the near&#8208;surface region of Ag@AgCu core@satellites, contributing to the increased surface *CO coverage, lowered *COCOH formation barrier and deceased *CHCOH&#8208;to&#8208;C2H5OH conversion free energy. Thus, a high C2H5OH selectivity (FE&#160;=&#160;65.5%) at industrial&#8208;level current density (&#8722;280&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) was achieved over Ag@AgCu core@satellites in a photo&#8208;electrochemical flow cell.

         <title>Bidirectional Electron Relay at TiN&#8208;TiO2 Interfaces Enables Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Ru for High&#8208;Potential Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based catalysts face catastrophic activity loss above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to oxidation and OH over&#8208;adsorption. A TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;derived charge&#8208;relay is proposed to realize potential&#8208;adaptive electronic regulation of Ru sites, spatially isolating Had/OHad and enabling metallic Ru0 preservation above 1.0&#160;V. This dual&#8208;phase design achieves unprecedented 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V and resolves the fundamental oxidation&#8208;driven deactivation.








Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;based catalysts are pivotal as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to Pt for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, they typically face irreversible deactivation above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to synergistic Ru oxidation/OHad over&#8208;adsorption. We propose a Taichi&#8208;inspired TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;segregated electron&#8208;relay mechanism that dynamically balances bidirectional electron flow (Ru&#8594;TiN electron donation and TiO2&#8594;Ru electron replenishment), achieving complete activity retention (100%) even under 1.1&#160;V operation. This potential&#8208;adaptive regulation can significantly inhibit electron redistribution and band compression under the high potential induced electric field, and effectively alleviate the d&#8208;band upshift and OH adsorption energy surge. Spatially decoupled Ti(TiN)&#8208;Ru bridge sites simultaneously adsorb OHad (Eads = &#8208;1.40&#160;eV) and decouple Had/OHad adsorption domains, eliminating competitive binding. This configuration delivers triple synergies: 1) geometric isolation of reactive intermediates adsorption, 2) potential&#8208;responsive Ru0 stabilization, and 3) accelerated Volmer kinetics via interfacial hydroxyl migration. The Ru/TiN&#8208;TiO2 catalyst achieves 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V vs. RHE (vs. &gt;60% loss for Ru/TiN) with 73.23% metallic Ru0 preserved after 10&#160;h operation. This work resolves the intrinsic activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in Ru HOR catalysts and establishes dynamic charge&#8208;relay interfaces as a universal design paradigm for oxidation&#8208;prone electrocatalysts.

         <title>Highly Stable Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Adapted to Fluctuating Renewable Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating renewable energy with electrocatalysis can cut carbon emissions and boost energy efficiency, greening the chemical industry. Our research tackles the challenge of renewable energy's variability by introducing a stable, efficient oxygen reduction system that produces eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen peroxide. This system, using O&#8208;coordinated cobalt catalysts, maintains high performance even with fluctuating power, with over 55 start&#8722;&#8208;stop cycles and 96% Faradic efficiency.








Abstract
The integration of renewable energy with electrocatalytic technology affords an effective pathway to reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy efficiency, thereby promoting the green electrification of the chemical industry. However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady&#8208;state, start&#8722;stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of &#8722;50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the system sustains over 55 stable start&#8722;stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir&#8208;containing O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom sites and the self&#8208;healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation. By addressing the variability of renewable energy and optimizing the integration of electrochemical processes, our work paves the way for fully realizing green electrification in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Gypsum Gardens: Self&#8208;Assembled Tubular Structures of Calcium Sulfate with Relevance for the Detection of Extraterrestrial Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled architectures with &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies that form in the absence of any biological activity. Here we show that such structures can also be obtained by contacting reservoirs of calcium and sulfate ions, under conditions that plausibly emulate those prevailing on early Mars. Our results demonstrate that mineralization in purely inorganic, sulfate&#8208;rich environments can produce solid matter with biomimetic shapes and may thus lead to false&#8208;positive detection of life on the red planet.








Abstract
Form is a common and intuitive criterion to distinguish between the realm of living species and the inanimate nature. However, there are in fact no strict boundaries in terms of morphology, as exemplified by so&#8208;called chemical gardens, which form by self&#8208;assembly in purely inorganic systems and yet closely mimic the appearance of trees and other plants. While such structures have been reported for a broad range of compositions&#8211;most notably silicates of various types of metal cations as well as prominent (bio)minerals like calcium carbonate or phosphate&#8211;one important material has been missing in the comprehensive list of these chemobrionic systems: calcium sulfate. In the present work, we succeeded in preparing well&#8208;developed CaSO4&#8208;based chemical gardens by addition of a concentrated solution of sodium sulfate to solid crystals of calcium chloride. The formed structures were characterized in detail with respect to their growth behavior, mineralogy, and texture. We find hollow tubular architectures consisting of oriented gypsum crystals and delineating smooth curvatures with multiple branching sites. Beyond the sheer beauty of these self&#8208;assembled mineral structures, the results of our study bear deep implications for the detection and interpretation of potential past life on Mars, where abundant deposits of calcium sulfate exist. In addition, the current picture of geochemical environments on the early red planet is fully consistent with the experimental conditions used in the present work, rendering the formation and presence of chemical gardens on Mars plausible.

         <title>Unraveling and Suppression of Multi&#8208;Directional Planar Slipping and Microcracking in Single&#8208;Crystal Co&#8208;Free, Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>

Pillaring Mg2&#8314; into Co&#8208;free single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.75Mn0.25O2 suppresses multi&#8208;directional planar slipping and microcracking along the (003)/(100) planes, enhancing mechanical stability. DFT and COMSOL simulations unveil the interplay between internal stress and cleavage energy, guiding chemo&#8211;electro&#8211;mechanical optimization for durable Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. The schematic was created using Autodesk 3ds Max (Autodesk Inc.).








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for lithium&#8208;based batteries, but they suffer from chemo&#8211;electro&#8211;mechanical instabilities. While single&#8208;crystal morphologies reduce these issues, slipping, and microcracking persist during extended cycling, and the degradation mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Herein, we report on multi&#8208;directional planar slipping and microcracking along the (003) and (100) planes in a single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.75Mn0.25O2 (LNM) cathode. According to the Darken&#8211;Gurry theory and formation energy in LNM, magnesium (Mg2+) has been selected as the best pillaring element to strengthen the structural integrity and improve cycling stability. Notably, Li0.99Mg0.01Ni0.75Mn0.25O2 (LMNM) achieves a capacity retention of 91% after 1000 cycles at 4.3&#160;V operation against graphite by alleviating instability issues. We systematically unravel the pillaring effect, for the first time, from the quantum scale to the lattice level and from the microscale to the macroscopic level of the cathode particles, providing an in&#8208;depth understanding of chemo&#8211;electro&#8211;mechanical degradation.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Electrolyte and Electrode Structures Enhance Ammonium Vanadate Mg&#8208;storage Performance for 100 mAh&#8208;Level Mg&#8208;ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a synergistic strategy involving simultaneous regulation of the electrolyte and electrode structure was proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs). The assembled multilayer aqueous Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell delivers the highest capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh among. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs. These findings provide a novel strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance AMIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) have attracted increasing interest due to their safety, fast kinetics, and sustainability. However, the development of AMIBs is hindered by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of electrolytes and electrode degradation. Here, a synergistic strategy, regulating both electrolyte and electrode structures, is proposed to enable high&#8208;performance AMIBs. Incorporating a polyethylene glycol crowding agent into Mg(ClO4)2/H2O electrolyte regulates the solvation structure, which suppresses hydrogen evolution, and expands the ESW beyond 3.1&#160;V. Meanwhile, an ammonium vanadate (NHVO) material with enlarged interlayer spacing is synthesized, and a freestanding NHVO/graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (NHVO/GO/CNT) electrode is constructed to enhance Mg2+ diffusion and mitigate vanadium dissolution. Under the synergistic regulation, NHVO/GO/CNT exhibits a high capacity of 284.0 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and the longest cycling lifespan (16&#160;000 cycles with 95.6% capacity retention). The solvation structure of electrolytes and interfacial stabilization mechanisms are elucidated through theory calculations. The Mg&#8208;storage mechanism of NHVO based on a single&#8208;phase insertion/extraction reaction with NH4+/Mg2+ displacement phenomenon is revealed. The constructed multilayer Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell achieves a record&#8208;high capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrates the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs for the first time. This work offers a viable strategy toward practical, high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Tailoring Low&#8208;Miller&#8208;Index Crystal Facets Realizes Perovskite Solar Cells with Flat Grain&#8208;boundary Grooves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules tailored low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets, flattened grain&#8208;boundary grooves and reduced nanoscale physical voids, thus enabling 26.80% efficiency perovskite solar cells with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Charge transport and nonradiative recombination loss at the buried interface are important factors, which limit the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we screen a series of diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules, where N,N&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (N&#8208;DPPM) with appropriate alkyl chains and multiple active sites not only can efficiently facilitate carrier transport but also coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and interact with FA+ through N&#8943;H bond. These features prompt the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films along (100)/(200) crystal facets. Interestingly, these oriented low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets have approximately a twice&#8208;increase in heterointerface energy and twice&#8208;decrease in grain&#8208;boundary energy, flattening grain&#8208;boundary grooves, thereby reducing nanoscale physical voids and releasing residual stress. Consequently, the champion inverted PSCs exhibit impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.80%, 26.18%, and 20.59% for narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.55&#160;eV), large&#8208;area (0.5&#160;cm2), and wide&#8208;bandgap (1.73&#160;eV) devices, respectively. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent stability after long&#8208;term storage, thermal&#8208;aging, or light&#8208;soaking.

         <title>Decoration of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Coenzyme Mimics for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple molecule of 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide, mimicking the NAD(P)H coenzyme, is modified onto a metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. This simulant behaves like a redox&#8208;active coenzyme, promoting proton and electron transfer by serving as their relays. The coenzyme&#8208;like regeneration mechanism is demonstrated in the involved photocatalytic process, giving rise to improved charge separation and significantly enhanced activity.








Abstract
Despite remarkable progress achieved in biomimetic catalysis, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on mimicking the structures of catalytic sites in metalloenzymes, while frequently neglecting the crucial roles of multifunctional coenzymes therein. In this study, the coenzyme mimics of nicotinic acid (NA) and 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide (NA&#8208;Me, simply denoted as NM) have been modified onto the metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affording UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#9552;NA, NM) with varying the degree of mimicry for the nicotinamide nucleotide coenzyme. Remarkably, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NM showcases approximately five&#8208; and seven&#8208;fold activity higher than UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NA and the pristine UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the NM dangling on the MOF undergoes structural redox change similar to that in the regeneration process of NAD(P)H coenzyme, which serves as the proton and electron relays surrounding catalytic Pt sites, facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and thereby boosting photocatalytic activity. This work offers new insights and strategies for the design and fabrication of biomimetic heterogeneous catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The simple molecule of 3-carboxy-1-methylpyridinium iodide, mimicking the NAD(P)H coenzyme, is modified onto a metal-organic framework, UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. This simulant behaves like a redox-active coenzyme, promoting proton and electron transfer by serving as their relays. The coenzyme-like regeneration mechanism is demonstrated in the involved photocatalytic process, giving rise to improved charge separation and significantly enhanced activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite remarkable progress achieved in biomimetic catalysis, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on mimicking the structures of catalytic sites in metalloenzymes, while frequently neglecting the crucial roles of multifunctional coenzymes therein. In this study, the coenzyme mimics of nicotinic acid (NA) and 3-carboxy-1-methylpyridinium iodide (NA-Me, simply denoted as NM) have been modified onto the metal-organic framework UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, affording UiO-66-X (X&#9552;NA, NM) with varying the degree of mimicry for the nicotinamide nucleotide coenzyme. Remarkably, UiO-66-NM showcases approximately five- and seven-fold activity higher than UiO-66-NA and the pristine UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the NM dangling on the MOF undergoes structural redox change similar to that in the regeneration process of NAD(P)H coenzyme, which serves as the proton and electron relays surrounding catalytic Pt sites, facilitating proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and thereby boosting photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Box[6]arenes for 3D Charge&#8208;Transfer Co&#8208;Crystal Engineering via Macrocyclic Self&#8208;Complementary and Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Box[6]arene (B[6]A), a new kind of macrocyclic arene with flexible skeleton and bright fluorescence, has been designed and synthesized. Through the macrocyclic self&#8208;complementarity and &#8220;exo&#8208;wall&#8221; CT interactions, three 3D supramolecular assemblies are formed with the electron&#8208;deficient planar molecules TCNB, TFTN, and TClTN, showing tunable fluorescence and selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers.








Abstract
The construction of well&#8208;defined 3D charge&#8208;transfer (CT) co&#8208;crystals using new macrocyclic hosts to enable programmable functionality remains challenging due to the dimensional constraints imposed by conventional assembly strategies. Herein, we address this limitation using a new synthetic macrocycle named box[6]arene (B[6]A) with a flexible skeleton, which adopts two distinct conformations (B[6]A&#945; and B[6]A&#946;). Crucially, the self&#8208;complementary and exo&#8208;wall CT co&#8208;assembly of B[6]A facilitates the construction of 3D macrocycle&#8208;based co&#8208;crystals (MCCs) with planar electron&#8208;deficient guests, including 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFTN), and tetrachloroterephthalonitrile (TClTN). These MCCs exhibit tunable fluorescence with emission maxima at 690, 594, and 592&#160;nm, respectively. Notably, activated B[6]A&#8208;TCNB demonstrates selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers via a dual response mechanism. This study provides new insights into the design of functional macrocyclic arenes and 3D MCCs, paving the way for the development of color&#8208;tunable crystalline luminescent materials and advanced vapochromic systems.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Axial Imaging for Quantifying Piconewton Traction Forces in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a hybrid imaging approach that combines MIET with DNA&#8208;based molecular tension probes to map piconewton cellular traction forces with nanometer axial resolution. This method enables simultaneous visualization of integrin forces and membrane topography in live cells.








Abstract
Cell mechanics play a pivotal role in regulating numerous biological processes. Although super&#8208;resolution microscopy enables the imaging of cellular forces in the lateral dimension with sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm resolution, achieving comparable resolution along the axial dimension remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer (MIET)&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a technique for mapping cellular mechanical forces with nanometer precision in the axial direction. This approach combines the nanometer spatial resolution of MIET imaging with the piconewton sensitivity of DNA&#8208;hairpin&#8208;based molecular tension probes (MTPs), enabling the simultaneous observation of both the plasma membrane and force&#8208;exerting molecules in the axial dimension. Using MIET&#8208;TPM, we mapped axial integrin tension within focal adhesions and podosomes, alongside their corresponding plasma membrane height profiles, offering detailed insights into the nanoscale structures and mechanisms involved in force transmission. Notably, MIET&#8208;TPM can be implemented on any fluorescence microscopy setup without hardware modifications, making it a versatile and accessible tool that promises to become an integral part of future cellular mechanobiology&#160;analysis.

Abstract
In this study, an enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;bis(allenes) to furnish 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted five&#8208;membered (hetero)cycles in high yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity is presented. The possibility of further functionalization to access different chiral cyclic and bicyclic skeletons is provided by the two orthogonal functional groups (alkyne and alkene). We also demonstrate the scalability of the reaction through a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and illustrate the synthetic utility of the resulting 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted cyclic product via several transformations. The proposed reaction mechanism is supported by both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy using alkenyl thianthrenium salts and gem&#8208;diborylalkanes for the efficient stereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. This method features broad substrate scope, high yields, and excellent diastereoselectivity. The protocol is scalable, allowing both diverse downstream derivatization and efficient preparation of cyclopropane&#8208;containing pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8211;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;diboronate substituted cyclopropanes in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and synthesis.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Hybrid Ethylene Glycol Side Chains: A Solution to Water Related Challenges in n&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>

         <dc:description>
To address water related challenges in n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), we proposed an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. As a result, fag&#8208;modified OMIECs achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* value of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and maintain 68% performance after 50&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.








Abstract
The water molecule is regarded as a double&#8208;edged sword in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), particularly for n&#8208;type semiconductors. On the one hand, hydration facilitates ion transport within OMIECs; on the other hand, water acts as an electron trap, capturing electrons in n&#8208;type materials. Excessive hydration may disrupt the continuity of OMIECs crystalline domains, leading to device degradation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. The strong hydrophobicity of fluoroalkyl segments effectively repels water from polymer backbone, thereby reducing electron trapping. Meanwhile, the ethylene glycol components facilitate efficient ion transport. These findings are confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D). Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of fluorine lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which in turn enhances stability in aqueous environments. We also discovered that the incorporation of fag side chains also promotes polymer self&#8208;assembly and improves crystallinity. Grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals a face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on mixed orientation in fag&#8208;based polymers, facilitating efficient ion&#8208;electron transport. Consequently, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) fabricated from fag&#8208;based OMIECs demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type performance, achieving a &#181;C* figure of merit of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, they exhibit excellent stability, retaining 68% of their initial performance after 50&#160;000 switching cycles in aqueous electrolyte. This study demonstrates that a rational approach to molecular design can effectively alleviate the detrimental effects of water, providing a novel strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>A General Strategy to Develop Highly Sensitive FAP&#945; Fluorescent Probes for Invasive Cancer Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the construction of fluorescent probe library and the deep analysis of FAP&#945;&#8217;s structure, we proposed and confirmed that introducing a positive charge onto the fluorophore skeleton could markedly improve the response efficiency of FAP&#945; fluorescent probe. By virtue of the high sensitivity of FQCy7 toward FAP&#945;, we achieved significant differentiation between invasive tumors and benign lesions, as well as minimally invasive foci in paracancerous tissues.








Abstract
Fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) has been reported to be expressed in many carcinoma cells and associated with tumor growth, invasive, and metastasis. However, due to the lack of appropriate fluorescent probes, detecting FAP&#945; with high sensitivity in tumor and clearly delineating tumor margins remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a general design strategy&#8212;introducing a positive charge into the fluorophore skeleton&#8212;for the construction of FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with enhanced sensitivity. Molecular docking simulations and fluorescence spectra revealed that the FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with positive charges displayed an improved affinity and sensitivity toward FAP&#945;. As demonstration, FQCy7, featuring two positive charges, NIR fluorescence emission, and large Stokes shift, exhibited a satisfactory sensitivity toward FAP&#945; and was used for the relationship study between FAP&#945; and carcinoma cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that FQCy7 is highly useful in distinguishing invasive tumor from benign lesions and evaluating the precise resection of tumor tissues. This work not only reports an original strategy to design FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probes with high sensitivity but also provides a powerful tool for precise tumor detection.

         <title>Design and Preparation of Self&#8208;Adaptive and Robust Solid&#8208;State Elastomeric Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery Inspired by Rubber Tire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte inspired by rubber tires is designed, combining molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. By optimizing the elastomer&#8208;to&#8208;DEE ratio and integrating a polyethylene scaffold, the SSEE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1) and low interfacial resistance. It retains 88.33% capacity after 800 cycles in full&#8208;cell configurations.








Abstract
The development of safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes remains a central challenge for advancing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) toward practical deployment. Inspired by the durable, deformable nature of rubber tires, we report the design and preparation of a self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte containing a deep eutectic electrolyte, termed PMEC, which integrates molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. The PMEC membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C), a high Li&#8314; transference number (0.64), excellent elasticity, and robust interfacial adhesion (36.34&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2). Structural characterizations confirm its amorphous and homogeneously mixed nature, while micro&#8208;Raman and XPS/TOF&#8208;SIMS analyses reveal uniform component distribution and the formation of an organic&#8211;inorganic gradient SEI layer on lithium. These features enable exceptional electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full batteries, including over 2000 h of stable cycling and &gt;800 cycles at 0.5&#160;C in LFP|PMEC|Li batteries with &gt;88% capacity retention. Moreover, PMEC&#8208;based pouch batteries maintain functionality under severe mechanical abuse. This tire&#8208;inspired electrolyte&#160;design offers a generalizable platform for high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>A Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;type Organic Molecule as an Effective Electrode to Form Rapid Diffusion Pathway for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A poorly soluble organic molecule, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI&#8208;DTMA), with a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, has been demonstrated to be an efficient anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast Na+ transport kinetics. This has led to a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after stable 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing organic electrodes have been widely considered as ideal substitutes for traditional inorganic compounds in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent redox reversibility and structural tunability. However, constructing effective Na+ diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI&#8208;DTMA), containing a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure. The D&#8211;A&#8211;D architecture significantly enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI&#8208;DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for&#160;Na+ mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI&#8208;DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 owing&#160;to its fast Na+ kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI&#8208;DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.

         <title>Multicomponent Assembly of High&#8208;Component Covalent Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The employment of multicomponent reactions enables the synthesis of the highest component [6+24+24] covalent organic cages featuring coronavirus&#8208;shaped structures. These cages are assembled through C&#9552;N, B&#8592;N, and B&#9472;O linkages. Moreover, they can be readily functionalized by merely choosing spike alcohol synthons with specific functionalization and desired properties.








Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs), a powerful strategy for generating desired products by employing more than two starting materials in one&#8208;pot reactions, have been determined to be a superior synthetic strategy to achieve structural complexity and functional diversity. However, the use of MCRs in fabricating the multicomponent covalent organic cages (MCOCs) is still in its infancy. Here we report coronavirus&#8208;shaped MCOCs, formed by MCR involving a Schiff&#8208;base reaction (C&#9552;N bonds), coupled with the formation of dative B&#8592;N and B&#9472;O bonds. Specifically, reaction of bowl&#8208;shaped tetraformylcalix[4]resorcinarene, linear heteroditopic amino&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acid, and spike alcohol synthons can afford [6+24+24] MCOCs with a large octahedral cavity, 8 triangle windows, 12 rhombic windows, and 24 functional alcohols, as determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Notably, the number of components for the MCOCs reaches up to 54, making them the highest in covalent organic cages. Such MCR self&#8208;assembly can also afford MCOCs other sizes and topologies just using amino&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acid synthons with different lengths and angles. Interestingly, the MCOCs can be functionalized by alcohols with different substituent groups via both one&#8208;pot reaction and post&#8208;synthetic modification methods for desired properties. This work emphasizes the utilization of MCRs in constructing functional high&#8208;component organic cages with desired properties.

         <title>Interactome Profiling of a Lysine Deacetylase Trapping Probe Library Uncovers Crosstalk Between HDAC6 and NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a peptide probe library containing hydroxamic acids based on putative substrate sites of lysine deacetylase HDAC6. Analyzing substrate selectivity and turnover combined with proteomics profiling resulted in identification of novel HDAC6 interaction partners, such as components of the transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B. Importantly, HDAC6 counteracted the activity of acetylated NF&#8208;&#954;B p50, indicating a potential role in NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. 








Abstract
Lysine or histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues of numerous proteins, thereby regulating their function and activity. HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6&#8208;trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro&#8208;inflammatory transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF&#8208;&#954;B activity induced upon p300&#8208;catalyzed acetylation of NF&#8208;&#954;B p50. These findings indicate a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of nucleophilic 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and 2,3&#8208;unsaturated C&#8208;glycosides in good yields with excellent selectivity. A DFT&#8208;assisted, data&#8208;driven predictive model was established to guide rational ligand design, laying a solid foundation for future advances in regiodivergent glycosylation.








Abstract
The selective modification of carbohydrates to achieve structural complexity has emerged as a crucial strategy in carbohydrate&#8208;based drug development. However, the intricate stereochemistry and densely packed functional groups of carbohydrates pose significant challenges for precise stereoselectivity and regioselectivity control. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals, establishing a robust platform for glycoside diversification with versatile C1 and C3 modification. Notably, stable 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals with 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraethylethylene glycol protection were first synthesized and fully characterized. Operating under mild conditions, this reaction enables the efficient synthesis of diverse 2,3&#8208;unsaturated aryl/alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Importantly, this ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent C&#8208;glycosylation offers a concise and efficient strategy for accessing 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals (C3&#8208;arylated/alkenylated glycals), circumventing time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step sequences. To elucidate the origins of regioselectivity control, we employ a data&#8208;driven approach integrating DFT&#8208;assisted multivariate regression analysis, identifying key ligand parameters that govern regioselectivity. Leveraging this predictive model, we pursued rational ligand design to enhance C3&#8208;glycosylation selectivity and yield. Additionally, density functional theory calculations (DFT) provide critical insights into the fundamental principles dictating regioselectivity and tunability. These findings establish a solid foundation for advancing ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosylation reactions and significantly expand the synthetic toolkit for glycochemical synthesis.

         <title>Nanodroplet Array Platform for Integrated Synthesis and Screening of MEK Inhibitors: a Miniaturized Approach to Early Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a nanodroplet array platform that integrates solid&#8208;phase synthesis, MALDI&#8208;MS analysis, and cell&#8208;based screening. Using nanoliter droplets, we synthesized and tested 325 potential MEK inhibitors and identified 46 active compounds. This miniaturized approach combines chemistry and biology on a single chip, reducing time, cost, and material use in early&#8208;stage drug discovery.








Abstract
Early&#8208;stage drug discovery relies on high&#8208;throughput screenings, which are costly and time&#8208;intensive, limiting access for academic laboratories and small companies. A key bottleneck is the lack of miniaturization and the separation of compound synthesis from screening. We present a nanoliter droplet array platform integrating synthesis, characterization, and cell&#8208;based screening of 325 MEK (mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors, targeting the MAPK/ERK (mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase/extracellular signal&#8208;regulated kinase) pathway, implicated in colorectal and pancreatic cancer. The platform enables on&#8208;chip synthesis, MALDI&#8208;MSI (matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry imaging) characterization, and cell&#8208;based screening within 200&#160;nL droplets containing 20&#160;nmol starting material (&#8764;4&#160;ng final compound), and only 300 cells per droplet. Screening identified 46 compounds with higher cytotoxicity than mirdametinib, a clinically approved MEK inhibitor. Molecular docking revealed a shared allosteric binding mechanism, indicating non&#8208;competitive ATP inhibition. Synthesis and screening of all 325 compounds were completed within 7 days, requiring &lt;10&#160;mg of reactants, &lt;250&#160;&#181;L solvent, and &#8764;100&#160;&#181;L of cell suspension (&#8764;100,000 cells in total). Our results demonstrate that integrating miniaturized combinatorial synthesis and biological screening in a single platform can accelerate early&#8208;stage drug discovery while reducing cost and resource use.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay for C&#9472;N Cleavage and Ring Expansion: Accessing Medium&#8208;Sized Lactams From Unstrained Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay approach has been successfully developed for the direct cleavage of the C&#9472;N bond in unstrained cyclic amines. This method allows for the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams containing a Z&#8208;olefin moiety.

Abstract
The synthesis of medium&#8208;ring lactams constitutes a formidable yet pivotal frontier in modern chemical research. Persistent endeavors in this field are essential for overcoming the prevailing obstacles, particularly in the realm of ring expansion strategies for unstrained cyclic amines. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay process that accomplishes direct C&#9472;N bond cleavage in unstrained cyclic amines, thereby enabling the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams adorned with a Z&#8208;olefin moiety. Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing &#945;&#8208;amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical&#8208;polar&#8208;crossover&#8208;induced C&#9472;N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics. This advancement not only broadens the synthetic methodology for medium&#8208;ring lactam construction but also paves the way for future explorations in complex molecule synthesis and drug discovery.

&lt;p&gt;A photoredox-catalyzed radical relay approach has been successfully developed for the direct cleavage of the C&#9472;N bond in unstrained cyclic amines. This method allows for the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11-membered lactams containing a &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-olefin moiety. Control experiments and computational investigations have confirmed that the ring-expansion mechanism commences with the C&#9472;N bond cleavage induced by reductive radical-polar crossover.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Macrocycles: Photoswitching, Amplified Chirality, and Photo&#8208;Tailored Chiroptics</title>

         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral macrocycles with reversible photoregulatable chiroptics (|gabs|: 0.023&#8596;0.014; CPL ON/OFF) and cave sizes (e.g., 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8&#160;&#197; &#8596; 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;) were firstly synthesized, which do not exist in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Continuous chirality amplification was realized, giving high dissymmetry factors (|gabs| = 0.023, |glum| = 0.013). A size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively.








Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have attracted considerable attention because of their fascinating circular chiral topologies, circularly distributed electronic structures, and excellent chiroptical features. However, the challenging synthesis and limited cases hinder the understanding, improvement, and regulation of their optoelectronic properties. To avoid this dilemma, we employed cyclic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between dithienylethene (DTE) and [6]helicene to firstly synthesize donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles, including m&#8208;[1&#160;+&#160;1], m&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2], and m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3], where these compounds displayed photocontrollable ring sizes and chiroptical properties. More importantly, continuous amplification in chirality can be achieved via distinctive multiple chiral&#8208;centers&#8208;bonding in series within helical rings, giving high |gabs| and |glum| of up to 0.023 and 0.013, respectively. The macrocycles were endowed with a photoswitchable function that is absent in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Both the cavity sizes and chiroptical properties could be photoregulated. As typical examples, the cavity dimension of m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;PPP was photoadjusted from 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8 to 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;, accompanied by reversible photoswitched |gabs| between 0.023 and 0.014 and remarkable CPL ON/OFF behavior. Moreover, a size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively, i.e., the photoswitching ability increased with increasing ring size. Our study provides a new guidance for developing high&#8208;performance chiral systems and novel stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral macrocycles and provides ideal platforms for understanding chiral structure&#8211;functionality relationships.

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h-1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &amp;gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag-N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain&#8208;release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise, but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (SmI2) catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro-activated) photocatalysts to dye-sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Strategies Applied to the Late&#8208;Stage Modifications of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review explores the potential of mechanochemistry in the late&#8208;stage modification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), offering a comprehensive analysis of methods designed to transform structurally complex molecular scaffolds. By examining the scope, efficiency, and mechanistic aspects of these approaches, the review highlights protocols capable of effectively modifying structurally complex molecular scaffolds. To further assist researchers, we provide a detailed table summarizing the discussed APIs, their respective modifications, and any necessary pre&#8208;functionalizations. This resource should provide a practical guide for selecting suitable substrates to evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of existing and novel (mechano)chemical methods.</dc:description>
