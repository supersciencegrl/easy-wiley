      <dc:description>Vapor phase treatment of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with manganese(II) acetylacetonate&#160;(Mn(acac)  2  )  &#160;  allows permselectivity tuning. Propylene/propane selectivity increases from 31 to 210 after the Mn(acac)  2  treatment at 165&#176;C for 30 min, while selectivities increase from 14.6 to 242 for H  2  /CH  4  , from 2.9 to 38 for CO  2  /CH  4  , from 2.4 to 29 for CO  2  /N  2  , from 2.9 to 8 for O  2  /N  2  , after Mn(acac)  2  treatment at 175&#176;C for 30 min. Stable equimolar propylene/propane mixture selectivity of 168 at ambient temperature, and 4 bar equimolar feed with a propylene flux of 8.3 x 10  &#8208;3  mol m  &#8208;2  s  &#8208;1  is established. A control experiment excludes thermal treatment alone&#160;causing these changes. XPS analysis reveals the presence of Mn(acac)  2  on the outer surface of the vapor&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8 membranes while no other changes are detectable by X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Giant Optical Activity in 2D Hybrid Copper Halides: Novel Material for Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have emerged as highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Incorporating chiral organic molecules into metal halides allows for the expansion of their unique optical and electronic properties to chiral optics. Herein, using chiral R&#8208; or S&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA) as the organic component, we present the synthesis of chiral hybrid copper halides, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)  2  CuCl  4  , and investigate their optical activity&#160;for the first time. Thin films of this material show a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor as high as ~0.06. Additionally, we discuss the origin of giant&#160;optical&#160;activity observed in (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)  2  CuCl  4  &#160;through theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and&#160;demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in these samples.&#160;Our work provides insights into the design of chiral materials by structural engineering, building a new platform for chiral&#160;and nonlinear photonic device&#160;applications of the chiral hybrid copper halides.</dc:description>

      <title>Bubble&#8208;propelled Janus Gallium/Zinc Micromotors for Active Treatment of Bacterial Infection</title>
      <dc:description>We report a bubble&#8208;propelled Janus gallium/zinc (Ga/Zn) micromotor with good biocompatibility and biodegradability for active target treatment for bacteria, as a robust antibacterial platform. The Janus Ga/Zn micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating liquid metal Ga on Zn microparticles, and display self&#8208;propelling movement in the imitative gastroenteric acid (pH 0.5) at a speed of up to 383 &#956;m s  &#8208;1  under the propulsion of hydrogen bubbles generated by the zinc&#8208;acid reaction. This motion of Ga/Zn micromotors is enhanced by the Ga&#8208;Zn galvanic effect. The produced Ga(III) cations due to the degradation of Ga/Zn micromotors are served as a built&#8208;in antibiotic agent. The movement improves the diffusion of Ga(III) and results in a significant increase of the antibacterial efficiency against  H. pylori  , compared with passive Ga microparticle. Such Ga/Zn micromotors combine the self&#8208;propulsion, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and Ga&#8208;based antibacterial properties, providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the active treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

However, the application of lithium metal anodes for practical batteries is still impeded by safety issues and low Coulombic efficiency caused mainly by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites. Herein, two types of free&#8208;standing nitrogen&#8208;doped amorphous Zn&#8208;carbon multichannel fibers are synthesized as multifunctional hosts for lithium accommodation.

As a result, the developed anodes exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500 cycles at various current densities from 1 to 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and symmetric cells show long&#8208;term cycling duration over 2000 h.

      <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging, despite the importance in understanding of their functions in diverse cellular processes. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria and nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxygen stress in live cells. Moreover, the combination of organelle&#8208;specific targeting with the remotely&#8208;controlled photoactivation of the nanosensors allows the precise APE1 imaging in vivo. We envision that this site&#8208;specific sensor technology will become a valuable tool for in situ monitoring subcellular enzymatic activity that is difficult to access using traditional imaging probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the Stacking Modes of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets through Host&#8208;Guest Noncovalent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>The tuning of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet stacking modes from molecular level was rarely explored although it significantly affected the&#160;properties and applications of nanosheets. Here, the different stacking modes of Zr&#8208;1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene framework nanosheets were synthesized through the induction of different host&#8208;guest noncovalent interactions. The solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets with the specific rotation angles of 12  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  and 6  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  , 30  o  , respectively, which was in agreement with theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the alkanes were likely to vertically enter the pores of Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets because of steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets. The untwisted ordered nanopores showed the excellent gas chromatographic separations of benzene derivative isomers, which was better than twisted nanosheets stacking and commercial columns. This work uncovers a rational strategy to control the stacking of two&#8208;dimensional MOF nanosheets.</dc:description>

      <title>Observation of Transition from Ferroelasticity to Ferroelectricity by Solvent Selective Effect in Anilinium Bromide</title>
      <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics are highly desirable for their lightweight, mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility. However, the rational design of organic ferroelectrics has always been faced with great challenges. Anilinium bromide (AB) has two structures reported in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, which might be an  mmm  F2/  m  type ferroelastic (AB&#8208;1). When we studied its ferroelasticity, we were surprised to discover that there was another crystal (AB&#8208;2) in H  2  O besides this one, and they were very difficult to separate. By changing the solvent, we found that AB&#8208;1 crystals could be formed in ethanol, where ferroelastic domains were visualized by polarized light microscopy, and AB&#8208;2 crystals could be obtained from various crystallisation solvents of methanol, isopropanol,  N  &#8208;butanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, and  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylformamide, which undergo a ferroelectric phase transition with  mm  2F  m  , showing clear ferroelectricity in two phases. To our knowledge, the regulation of ferroelasticity to ferroelectricity by solvent selective effect is unprecedented in the field of ferroelectrics. This work offers an efficient exploratory path to enriching the family of organic ferroelectrics, and should inspire further exploration of the interplay between solvent effect and physical properties.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Multienzyme cascade biocatalysis is an efficient synthetic process, avoiding the isolation/purification of intermediates and shifting the equilibria of unfavourable steps.

      <title>Site Selective Chlorination of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Suitable for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>C(  sp  3  )&#8722;Cl bonds are present in numerous biologically active small molecules and an ideal route for their preparation is by the chlorination of a C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bond. However, most current methods for the chlorination of C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds are insufficiently site&#8208;selective and tolerant of functional groups to be applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. We report a method for the highly selective chlorination of tertiary and benzylic C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds to produce the corresponding chlorides, generally in high yields. The reaction occurs with a mixture of an azidoiodinane, which generates a selective H&#8208;atom abstractor under mild conditions, and a readily&#8208;accessible and inexpensive copper(II) chloride complex, which efficiently transfers a chlorine atom. The reaction&#8217;s exceptional functional group tolerance is demonstrated by the chlorination of &gt;30 diversely functionalized substrates and the late&#8208;stage chlorination of a dozen derivatives of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;C(  sp  3  )&#8722;Cl bonds are present in numerous biologically active small molecules and an ideal route for their preparation is by the chlorination of a C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bond. However, most current methods for the chlorination of C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds are insufficiently site&#8208;selective and tolerant of functional groups to be applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. We report a method for the highly selective chlorination of tertiary and benzylic C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds to produce the corresponding chlorides, generally in high yields. The reaction occurs with a mixture of an azidoiodinane, which generates a selective H&#8208;atom abstractor under mild conditions, and a readily&#8208;accessible and inexpensive copper(II) chloride complex, which efficiently transfers a chlorine atom. The reaction&#8217;s exceptional functional group tolerance is demonstrated by the chlorination of &amp;gt;30 diversely functionalized substrates and the late&#8208;stage chlorination of a dozen derivatives of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Vacancy&#8208;Enabled O3 Phase Stabilization for Manganese&#8208;rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, they usually form P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn&#8208;rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ~220 mAh/g. It delivers ~160 mAh/g specific capacity between 2&#8208;3.8V with &gt;86% retention over 250 cycles. Systematic characterizations and computational studies revealed that the TM and oxygen vacancies pre&#8208;formed in the sodiated material enables a &#8220;reversible&#8221; migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de&#8208;sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3&#8208;P3 phase transition, hence stabilizing the structure and battery performance. This work provides a critical insight on the role of vacancies in TM migration and stabilization of phase transition, and sheds light on the future development of high performance and stable cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral Self&#8208;sorting of Giant Cubic [8+12] Salicylimine Cage Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Among those systems a handful of shape&#8208;persistent organic cages were studied and rarely narcisstic or social self&#8208;sorting could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a  meso  cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso&#8208;cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of  d  in  = 3.3&#8208;3.5 nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500 m  2  /g after desolvation.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Among those systems a handful of shape&#8208;persistent organic cages were studied and rarely narcisstic or social self&#8208;sorting could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a  meso  cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso&#8208;cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of  d  in  = 3.3&#8208;3.5 nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500 m  2  /g after desolvation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>Hydration of alkenes using first row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn) under oxygen atmosphere (Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration) is highly practical for alkene functionalization in complex synthesis. Different hydration protocols have been developed, however, control of the stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, highly diastereoselective Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported. The nitro moiety is not well explored in radical chemistry and nitroarenes are known to suppress free radical processes. Our findings show the potential of cheap nitroarenes as oxygen donors in radical transformations. Secondary and tertiary alcohols were prepared with excellent Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity. The method features large functional group tolerance and is also applicable to highly diastereoselective alkene hydration of natural products, qualifying the protocol for late&#8208;stage chemical functionalization. It is shown that the anaerobic protocol outperforms existing hydration methodology in terms of reaction efficiency and selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction mechanism of CO  2  photoreduction into methane was elucidated by the time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under  13  CO  2  , H  2  , and UV&#8211;visible light,  13  CH  4  was formed at a rate of 0.98 mmol h  &#8722;1  g  cat  &#8722;1  using Ni (10 wt%)&#8211;ZrO  2  that was effective at 96 kPa. Under UV&#8211;visible light irradiation, the  13  CO  2  exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO  2  , followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni  0  sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni  0  , which was reversibly heated to 394 K owing to the heat converted from light. Using D  2  O and H  2  , H/D ratio in the formed methane was in agreement with H/D ratio in reactant.

      <dc:description>Low conductivity and hole mobility in the pristine metal phthalocyanines greatly limit their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). Here, we prepare a Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units as HTMs. In NiPc, the two oxygen atoms in peripheral substituent have a modified effect on the dipole direction, while the central Ni atom contributes more electron to phthalocyanine ring, thus efficiently increasing the intramolecular dipole. Calculation analyses reveal the extracted holes within NiPc are mainly concentrated on the phthalocyanine core induced by the intramolecular electric field, and further to be transferred by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking space channel between NiPc molecules. Finally, the best efficiency of PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTs realizes a record value of 21.23% (certified 21.03%). The PSCs also exhibit the good moisture, heating and light stabilities. This work provides a novel way to improve the performance of PSCs with free&#8208;doped metal phthalocyanines as HTMs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrooxidative annulations involving mild transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation have emerged as transformative strategy for the rapid construction of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. In contract, we herein describe the first electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed [5 + 2] cycloadditions to assemble valuable seven&#8208;membered benzoxepine skeletons by C&#8211;H/O&#8211;H activation. The efficient alkyne annulation featured ample substrate scope, using electricity as the only oxidant. Mechanistic studies provided strong support for a rhodium(III/I) regime, involving a benzoxepine coordinated rhodium(I) sandwich complex as the catalyst resting state, which was re&#8208;oxidized to rhodium(III) by anodic oxidation.</dc:description>

In contract, we herein describe the first electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed [5 + 2] cycloadditions to assemble valuable seven&#8208;membered benzoxepine skeletons by C&#8211;H/O&#8211;H activation. The efficient alkyne annulation featured ample substrate scope, using electricity as the only oxidant. Mechanistic studies provided strong support for a rhodium(III/I) regime, involving a benzoxepine coordinated rhodium(I) sandwich complex as the catalyst resting state, which was re&#8208;oxidized to rhodium(III) by anodic oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalyst for high performance H2 production: Ga doped polymeric carbon nitride</title>
      <dc:description>A photocatalyst system is generally constructed by catalyst and cocatalyst to achieve light absorption, electron&#8208;hole separation, and surface reaction. It is a great challenge to develop a sole photocatalyst with all functions to lower the efficiency loss. Here, we integrate the active GaN4  &#160;site into polymeric carbon nitride (CN) &#160; photocatalyst (GCN), which displays an excellent H2  &#160;production rate of 9904&#160; &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1. It is 162 and 3.3 times higher than that of&#160; CN &#160;with the absence&#160; ( 61&#160; &#956;molh&#8208;1  g&#8208;1)&#160; and presence ( 2981&#160; &#956;molh&#8208;1  g&#8208;1) of 1.0 wt% Pt, respectively. Under light irradiation, the electron is injected and stored at the GaN4  &#160;site, where the LUMO locates. The HOMO distributes on the aromatic ring resulting in the spatial charge separation.&#160; T ransient photovoltage discloses the electron storage capability of GCN. The negative GaN4&#160;  promotes the proton adsorption in the excited state. The positive adsorption energy drives the H2  &#160;desorption from GaN4&#160;  after passing the electron to the proton. Our work opens up opportunities for rational design and explores the novel catalyst for H2  &#160;production.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction Over Ultrathin Metallic Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Converting CO  2  and H  2  O into carbon&#8208;based fuel by IR light is a tough task. Herein, compared with other single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction is achieved by an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst&#65293;Ni&#8208;doped CoS  2  nanosheets (Ni&#8208;CoS  2  ). The evolution rate of CH  4  over Ni&#8208;CoS  2  is up to 101.8 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  . The metallic and ultrathin nature endow Ni&#8208;CoS  2  with excellent IR light absorption ability. The PL spectra and Arrhenius plots indicate that Ni atoms could facilitate the separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers and the decrease of the activation energy. Moreover, in situ FTIR, DFT calculations, and CH  4  &#8208;TPD reveal that the doped Ni atoms in CoS  2  could effectively depress the formation energy of the *COOH, *CHO and desorption energy of CH  4  . This work manifests that element doping in atomic level is a powerful way to control the reaction intermediates, providing possibilities to realize high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This work presents a chiral spiro&#8208;axis strategy which not only introduced the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) property into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules but also enhanced the intramolecular through space charge transfer (TSCT) process.

The resulting TADF enantiomers, (R/S)&#8208;OSFSO, display emission maxima at 470 nm, small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.022 eV and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 81.2% in co&#8208;doped film. The circularly polarized OLEDs (CP&#8208;OLEDs) based on (R)&#8208;OSFSO and (S)&#8208;OSFSO display obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with dissymmetry factor up to 3.0&#215;10&#8208;3  and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.0%. Moreover, the devices based on (R/S)&#8208;OSFSO show remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;off with an EQE of 19.3% at 1000 cd/m2  (roll&#8208;off &#8776;3.5%), which are among the top results of CP&#8208;OLEDs.</dc:description>

In this work, we conduct deuterium&#8208;oxide (D2O) titration experiments in a novel on&#8208;line gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system, to determine the content of metallic Li and lithium hydride (LiH) in cycled Li anodes disassembled from practical LiCoO2/Li LMBs.

Our results suggest that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical LMBs. More importantly, we reveal a temperature sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2H2 &#8652; LiH) governing formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anode.

      <title>&#8216;NAD&#8208;display&#8217;: Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput in Vitro&#160;Screening of NAD(H) Dehydrogenases Using Bead Display and Flow Cytometry</title>
      <dc:description>NAD(H)&#8208;utilizing enzymes are involved in diverse redox reactions and have thus been the subject of directed evolution campaigns to improve their function. To enable access to a larger swath of sequence space, we demonstrate the utility of a cell&#8208;free, ultrahigh&#8208;throughput directed evolution platform for dehydrogenases. Microbeads (1.5 million per sample) carrying both variant DNA and an immobilized analogue of NAD  +  were compartmentalized in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets, together with cell&#8208;free expression mixture and enzyme substrate, resulting in the recording of the phenotype (i.e. the ratio of NAD  +  :NADH) on each bead. The beads&#8217; phenotype could be read out and sorted for on a flow cytometer by using a highly sensitive fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor of the NAD  +  :NADH ratio. Integration of this &#8216;NAD&#8208;display&#8217; approach with our previously described Split &amp; Mix (SpliMLiB) method for generating large site&#8208;saturation libraries allowed straightforward screening of fully balanced site saturation libraries of formate dehydrogenase, with diversities of 2x10  4  . Based on modular design principles of synthetic biology NAD&#8208;display offers access to sophisticated in vitro selections, avoiding complex technology platforms.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Simulations suggest Vitamins, Retinoids and Steroids as Ligands of the Free Fatty Acid Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
      <dc:description>We investigate binding of linoleate and other potential ligands to the recently discovered fatty acid binding site in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations suggest that linoleate and dexamethasone stabilize the locked spike conformation, thus reducing the opportunity for ACE2 interaction. In contrast, cholesterol may expose the receptor&#8208;binding domain by destabilizing the closed structure, preferentially binding to a different site in the hinge region of the open structure. We docked a library of FDA&#8208;approved drugs to the fatty acid site using an approach that reproduces the structure of the linoleate complex. Docking identifies steroids (including dexamethasone and vitamin D); retinoids (some known to be active  in vitro  , and vitamin A); and vitamin K as potential ligands that may stabilize the closed conformation. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike fatty acid site may bind a diverse array of ligands, including dietary components, and therefore provides a promising target for therapeutics or prophylaxis.</dc:description>

      <title>Cryptic sulfur incorporation in thioangucycline biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfur incorporation into natural products is a critical area of biosynthetic studies. Recently, a subset of sulfur&#8208;containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether&#8208;bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B. However, systematic gene deletion of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by CRISPR/Cas9 could not identify any gene responsible for the conversion of the epoxide intermediate to TACs. Instead, a series of&#160;  in vitro  &#160;and&#160;  in vivo  &#160;experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non&#8208;enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the TACs are proposed to derive from a detoxification process. These results are expected to contribute to the study of both angucyclines and the utilization of inorganic sulfur in natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Electroconversion of CO2: An Organometallic Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
This review article illustrates and categorizes the currently favored molecular mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The resulting insights are corroborated by the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide has been a topic of interest in the field of CO2 utilization for a long time. Recently, the area has seen increasing dynamics as an alternative strategy to catalytic hydrogenation for CO2 reduction. While many studies focus on the direct electron transfer to the CO2 molecule at the electrode material, molecular transition metal complexes in solution offer the possibility to act as catalysts for the electron transfer. C1 compounds such as carbon monoxide, formate, and methanol are often targeted as the main products, but more elaborate transformations are also possible within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This perspective article will cover selected examples to illustrate and categorize the currently favored mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The insights will be corroborated with the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive potential strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of possible products.

      <title>Vapochromic Behaviors of A Solid&#8208;State Supramolecular Polymer Based on Exo&#8208;Wall Complexation of Perethylated Pillar[5]arene with 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetracyanobenzene</title>
      <dc:description>The research for the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymers with specific functions accelerates the development of supramolecular and materials sciences. Here, we discover the different complexation modes of perethylated pillar[5]arene (  EtP5  ) with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (  TCNB  ) in various solvents. Driven by charge&#8208;transfer interaction,  TCNB  is enclosed in the cavity of  EtP5  in CHCl  3  , while  TCNB  complexes with  EtP5  at the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  in CH  2  Cl  2  . This is because the size of CH  2  Cl  2  matches the cavity of  EtP5  , forcing  TCNB  to complex with the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  . Furthermore, we fabricate a vapochromic solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer by exploiting the exo&#8208;wall complexation, which turns from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of alkyl aldehyde vapors. The adsorptive nature for alkyl aldehyde vapors comes from the unoccupied cavity of  EtP5  based on C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The vapochromic property is attributed to the change of the charge&#8208;transfer interaction caused by molecular rearrangement induced by vapor&#8208;capture in the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer.</dc:description>

Here, we discover the different complexation modes of perethylated pillar[5]arene (  EtP5  ) with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (  TCNB  ) in various solvents. Driven by charge&#8208;transfer interaction,  TCNB  is enclosed in the cavity of  EtP5  in CHCl  3  , while  TCNB  complexes with  EtP5  at the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  in CH  2  Cl  2  . This is because the size of CH  2  Cl  2  matches the cavity of  EtP5  , forcing  TCNB  to complex with the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  . Furthermore, we fabricate a vapochromic solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer by exploiting the exo&#8208;wall complexation, which turns from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of alkyl aldehyde vapors. The adsorptive nature for alkyl aldehyde vapors comes from the unoccupied cavity of  EtP5  based on C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The vapochromic property is attributed to the change of the charge&#8208;transfer interaction caused by molecular rearrangement induced by vapor&#8208;capture in the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Orthogonal Regulation of Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Couplings between Indazoles and Isoprene</title>
      <dc:description>Depending on the reactant property and reaction mechanism, one major regioisomer can be favored in a reaction that involves multiple active sites. Herein, an orthogonal regulation of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in the regiodivergent hydroamination of isoprene with indazoles is demonstrated. Under Pd&#8208;hydride catalysis, the 1,2&#8208; or 4,3&#8208;insertion pathway with respect to the electrophilic sites on isoprene could be controlled by the choice of ligands. In terms of the nucleophilic sites on indazoles, the reaction occurs at either the  N1&#8208; or  N2&#8208;position of indazoles is governed by the acid co&#8208;catalysts. Preliminary experimental studies have been performed to rationalize the mechanism and regioselectivity. This study not only contributes a practical tool for selective functionalization of isoprene, but also provides a guide to manipulate the regioselectivity for the  N&#8208;functionalization of indazoles.</dc:description>

      <title>Hexagonal RuSe2 Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanomaterials have emerged as promising alternatives to platinum (Pt) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the family of layered TMDs is mainly limited to Group IV&#8208;VII transition metals, while the synthesis of other group metals based layered TMDs still remains a challenge. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate by atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy that hexagonal RuSe2 (h&#8208;RuSe2) nanosheets with the mixture of 2H and 1T phases, a new member of layered TMDs family, can be obtained by a facile bottom&#8208;up colloidal synthetic approach. The obtained h&#8208;RuSe2, which can be transferred into the thermodynamically favorable phase of cubic RuSe2 (c&#8208;RuSe2) only after annealing at 600 &#176;C, exhibits Pt&#8208;like HER performance, with a 5&#8208;fold turnover frequency enhancement compared to the c&#8208;RuSe2 under alkaline media. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced adsorption free energies of H2O (&#916;GH2O*), optimized adsorption free energies of H (&#916;GH*) and increased conductivity of h&#8208;RuSe2 contribute to its superior HER activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Iron Porphyrins for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nature uses Fe porphyrin sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal Fe  V  =O form the O&#8722;O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of&#160;  trans  &#160;HO&#8722;Fe  V  =O, which is less effective to form O&#8722;O bond with hydroxide.

      <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
      <dc:description>Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8208;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using  in situ  IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO  2  formation rates than Pd alone.</dc:description>

A unique diene&#8208;platinum complex was identified to be an efficient catalyst, which enables direct metal&#8208;enolate formation.

      <dc:description>Unraveling the complexity of the lipidome requires the development of novel approaches for the structural characterization of lipid species with isomer&#8208;level discrimination. Herein, we introduce an online photochemical approach for lipid isomer identification through selective derivatization of double bonds by reaction with singlet oxygen. Lipid hydroperoxide products are generated promptly after laser irradiation. Fragmentation of these species in a mass spectrometer produces diagnostic fragments, which reveal the C=C locations in the unreacted lipids. This approach uses an inexpensive light source and photosensitizer making it easy to incorporate into any lipidomics workflow. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for the shotgun profiling of C=C locations in different lipid classes present in tissue extracts using electrospray ionization (ESI) and ambient imaging of lipid species differing only by the location of C=C bonds using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI).</dc:description>

      <title>A Desaturase&#8208;Like Enzyme Catalyzes Oxazole Formation in Pseudomonas Indolyloxazole Alkaloids</title>
      <dc:description>Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro&#8208; and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. In spite of their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an  N  &#8208;acyltransferase and a non&#8208;heme diiron desaturase&#8208;like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable&#8208;isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.</dc:description>

      <title>Minimization of Back&#8208;Electron Transfer Enables the Elusive sp3 C&#8211;H Functionalization of Secondary Anilines</title>
      <dc:description>Anilines are some of the most used class of substrates for application in photoinduced electron transfer.  N  ,  N  &#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;derivatives enable radical generation a to the  N  &#8208;atom by oxidation followed by deprotonation. This approach is however elusive to monosubstituted anilines owing to fast back&#8208;electron transfer (BET). Here we demonstrate that BET can be effectively minimised by using photoredox catalysis in the presence of an exogenous alkylamine. This approach synergistically aids aniline SET oxidation and then accelerates the following deprotonation. In this way, the generation of a&#8208;anilinoalkyl radicals is now possible and these species can be used in a general sense to achieve divergent sp  3  C&#8211;H functionalization.</dc:description>
