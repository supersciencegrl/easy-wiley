         <title>Design of 3D&#8208;Printed Heterogeneous Reactor Systems To Overcome Incompatibility Hurdles when Combining Metal and Enzyme Catalysis in a One&#8208;Pot Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis enables the design of novel economic and sustainable one&#8208;pot processes to industrial chemicals, preferably proceeding in water. While a range of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concepts for the compatibility of such catalysts from these two different &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221; have recently been demonstrated, merging non&#8208;compatible chemo&#8208; and biocatalysts for joint applications within one reactor remained a challenge. A conceptual solution is compartmentalization of the catalytic moieties by heterogenization of critical catalyst components, thus &#8220;shielding&#8221; them from the complementary non&#8208;compatible catalyst, substrate or reagent. Exemplified for a one&#8208;pot process consisting of a metal&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction as non&#8208;compatible individual reactions steps, we demonstrate that making use of 3D&#8208;printing of heterogeneous materials containing Cu as critical metal component can overcome such incompatibility hurdles. The application of a 3D&#8208;printed Cu&#8208;ceramic device as metal catalyst component allows an efficient combination with the enzyme and the desired two&#8208;step transformation of styrene into the chiral alcohol product with high overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity. This compartmentalization concept based on 3D&#8208;printing of heterogenized metal catalysts represents a scalable methodology and opens up numerous perspectives to be used as a general tool also for other related chemoenzymatic research challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>LiNO3&#8208;Based Electrolytes via Electron&#8208;Donation Modulation for Sustainable Nonaqueous Lithium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiPF6 as a dominant lithium salt of electrolyte is widely used in commercial rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its well&#8208;balanced properties, including high solubility in organic solvents, good electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. However, it suffers from several undesirable properties, such as high moisture sensitivity, thermal instability, and high cost. To address these issues, herein, we propose an electron&#8208;donation modulation (EDM) rule for the development of low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and electrochemically compatible LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes. We employ high donor&#8208;number solvents (HDNSs) with strong electron&#8208;donation ability to dissolve LiNO3, while low donor&#8208;number solvents (LDNSs) with weak electron&#8208;donation ability are used to regulate the solvation structure to stabilize the electrolytes. As an example, we design the LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte, where DMSO acts as an HDNS and PC serves as an LDNS. This electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical compatibility with graphite anodes, as well as the LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes, leading to stable cycling over 200 cycles. Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculation, we uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes using the EDM rule, opening new avenues for the development of advanced electrolytes with versatile functions for sustainable rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective&#160;Synthesis of Complex Polyenes through Sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of trans&#8208;Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequential C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules containing multiple C&#8722;H bonds can efficiently lead to structural diversity. Herein we present the first chelation&#8208;assisted sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E&#8208;styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization by six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;cyclopalladation to result in tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization through seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;cyclopalladation to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes in up to 97% yield with up to &gt; 99/1 E/Z selectivity, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide. The protocol is demonstrated to be widely applicable, tolerant to a wide range of functional groups and bioactive fragments, and suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as one&#8208;pot and two step preparation of trienes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the selectivity and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the Oxidative Potentials of Imines in a Dye Loaded Capsule for Photocatalytic Cyclization with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying redox potential of substrates and intermediates to balance pairs of redox steps are important stages for multistep photosynthesis but faced marked challenges. Through co&#8208;clathration of iridium photosensitizer and imine substrate within one packet of a metal&#8208;organic capsule to shift the redox potentials of substrate, herein, we reported a multiphoton enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8208;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings. The cage facilitated a pre&#8208;equilibrium substrate&#8208;involving clathrate that cathodic shifts the oxidation potential of the substrate&#8208;dye&#8208;host ternary complex and configuration inversion of substrate via spatial constraints in the confined space. The new two photon excitation strategy enabled the precise control of the multistep electron transfer between each pair (photosensitizer, substrate and the capsule), endowing the catalytic system proceeding smoothly with an enzymatic fashion. Three kinds of 2&#8208;subsituted (&#8208;OH, &#8208;NH2, and &#8208;SH) imines and N&#8208;aryl enamines all give the corresponding cyclization products efficiently under visible light irradiation, demonstrating the promising of the microenvironment driven thermodynamic activation in the host&#8208;dye&#8208;substrate ternary for synergistic combination of multistep photocatalytic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>BN&#8208;Isosteres of Nonacene with Antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 Heterocycles: Synthesis and Strong Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Embedding both boron and nitrogen into the backbone of acenes to generate their isoelectronic structures has significantly enriched the acene chemistry to offer appealing properties. However, only small BN&#8208;heteroacenes have been extensively investigated, with BN&#8208;heptacenes as the hitherto longest homologue. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres via incorporating antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles, representing a new length record for BN&#8208;heteroacenes. The distance between the B2C4 and N2C4 rings affects the contribution of the charge&#8208;separated resonance forms, leading to tunable antiaromaticity of the two heterocycles. The adjusted local antiaromaticity manifests substantial influence on the molecular orbital arrangement, and consequently, the radiative transition rate of BN&#8208;3 is greatly enhanced compared with BN&#8208;1 and BN&#8208;2, realizing a high fluorescence quantum yield of 92%. This work provides a novel design concept of large acene BN&#8208;isosteres and reveals the importance of BN/CC isosterism on their luminescent properties.</dc:description>

         <title>HClO&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Epoxidation of Alkenes with Near 100% Conversion Rate and Selectivity by Regulating Lattice Chlorine Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directional organic transformation via a green, sustainable catalytic reaction has attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo&#8208;generated charge, where the lattice Cl of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo&#8208;generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and being spontaneously recovered by Cl of salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water&#8208;soluble alkenes, including 4&#8208;vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid sodium, and 3&#8208;Methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol can be epoxidized with near 100% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl&#8208;MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120 hours. This work opens an avenue for solar&#8208;driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on&#8208;site reaction around the abundant ocean.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo-generated charge, where the lattice Cl of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo-generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and being spontaneously recovered by Cl of salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water-soluble alkenes, including 4-vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2-Methyl-2-propene-1-sulfonic acid sodium, and 3-Methyl-3-buten-1-ol can be epoxidized with near 100% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl-MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120 hours. This work opens an avenue for solar-driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on-site reaction around the abundant ocean.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Turbo&#8208;Charged&#8221; DNA Motors with Optimized Sequence Enable Single&#8208;Molecule Nucleic Acid Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA motors that consume chemical energy to generate processive mechanical motion mimic natural motor proteins and have garnered interest due to their potential applications in dynamic nanotechnology, biosensing, and drug delivery. Such motors translocate by a catalytic cycle of binding, cleavage, and rebinding between DNA &#8220;legs&#8221; on the motor body and RNA &#8220;footholds&#8221; on a track. Herein, we address the well&#8208;documented trade&#8208;off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg&#8208;foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0% GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150 nm/sec, three&#8208;fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0% GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single&#8208;molecule sensitivity when programming the motor to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets. These findings offer insights for the design of high&#8208;performance DNA motors with promising real&#8208;world biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible Synthesis of Polypropionates via Diastereodivergent Reductive Ring&#8208;Opening of Trisubstituted Secondary Glycidols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our novel approach towards polypropionate synthesis features stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks. The key&#8208;step of diversification is accomplished by mechanism&#8208;control of the diastereodivergent reductive opening at the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom that occurs with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Polypropionates, characterized by their alternating sequence of stereocenters bearing methyl&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;groups, are structurally diverse natural products of utmost importance.[1] Herein, we introduce a novel concept approach towards polypropionate synthesis featuring a diastereodivergent reductive epoxide&#8208;opening as a key step. Readily available and stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols serve as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks with three or more consecutive stereocenters. Stereodiversification is accomplished by an unprecedented mechanism&#8208;control over the stereochemically complementary modification of the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Since our method is not only suited for the preparation of specific targets but also for compound libraries, it will have a great impact on polypropionate synthesis.

         <title>Ultrafast Surface&#8208;Specific Spectroscopy of Water at a Photoexcited TiO2 Model Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After UV excitation electrons and holes are generated at a timescale faster than 300&#8197;fs. The holes located at the surface subsequently mediate the deprotonation of interfacial water into Ti&#8722;OH species and of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. At both pH&#8197;3 and 11 this reaction occurs in less than 20&#8197;ps.







Abstract
A critical step in photocatalytic water dissociation is the hole&#8208;mediated oxidation reaction. Molecular&#8208;level insights into the mechanism of this complex reaction under realistic conditions with high temporal resolution are highly desirable. Here, we use femtosecond time&#8208;resolved, surface&#8208;specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the photo&#8208;induced reaction directly at the interface of the photocatalyst TiO2 in contact with liquid water at room temperature. Thanks to the inherent surface specificity of the spectroscopic method, we can follow the reaction of solely the interfacial water molecules directly at the interface at timescales on which the reaction takes place. Following the generation of holes at the surface immediately after photoexcitation of the catalyst with UV light, water dissociation occurs on a sub&#8208;20&#8197;ps timescale. The reaction mechanism is similar at pH&#8197;3 and 11. In both cases, we observe the conversion of H2O into Ti&#8722;OH groups and the deprotonation of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. This study provides unique experimental insights into the early steps of the photo&#8208;induced dissociation processes at the photocatalyst&#8208;water interface, relevant to the design of improved photocatalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;reporting and Biodegradable Thermosetting Solid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the significant effort to improve the performance of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), direct monitoring of physical and chemical changes as well as the sustainability in SPEs is still lacking. Here, we report a self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable thermosetting SPE via well&#8208;designed structure to analyze the performance mechanism behind SPEs and promote the development of friendly environment.







Abstract
To date, significant efforts have been dedicated to improve their ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, direct monitoring of physical and chemical changes in SPEs is still lacking. Moreover, existing thermosetting SPEs are hardly degradable. Herein, by overcoming the limitation predicted by Flory theory, self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable thermosetting hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)&#8208;based SPEs (HPAE&#8208;SPEs) are reported. HPAE is successfully synthesized through a well&#8208;controlled &#8220;A2+B4&#8221; Michael addition strategy and then crosslinked it in situ to produce HPAE&#8208;SPEs. The multiple tertiary aliphatic amines at the branching sites confer multicolour luminescence to HPAE&#8208;SPEs, enabling direct observation of its physical and chemical damage. After use, HPAE&#8208;SPEs can be rapidly hydrolysed into non&#8208;hazardous &#946;&#8208;amino acids and polyols via self&#8208;catalysis. Optimized HPAE&#8208;SPE exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 60&#8201;&#176;C, a Na+ transference number (
) of 0.67, a highly stable sodium plating&#8208;stripping behaviour and a low overpotential of &#8776;190&#8197;mV. This study establishes a new paradigm for developing SPEs by engineering multifunctional polymers. The self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable properties would greatly expand the scope of applications for SPEs.

Abstract
An atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical and redox&#8208;neutral cascade reaction enabled by asymmetric bimetallic relay catalysis by merging a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition has been realized. A variety of highly functionalized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid esters or peptides bearing 1,4&#8208;non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers have been prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Judicious selection and rational modification of the Ru catalysts with careful tuning of the reaction conditions played a pivotal role in stereoselectivity control as well as attenuating undesired &#945;&#8208;epimerization, thus enabling a full complement of all four stereoisomers that were otherwise inaccessible in previous work. Concise asymmetric stereodivergent synthesis of the key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules further showcases the synthetic utility of this methodology.

A variety of highly functionalized 2-amino-5-hydroxyvaleric acid esters or peptides bearing 1,4-non-adjacent stereogenic centers have been prepared in high yields with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivity. Judicious selection and rational modification of the Ru catalysts with careful tuning of the reaction conditions played a pivotal role in stereoselectivity control as well as attenuating undesired &#945;-epimerization, thus enabling a full complement of all four stereoisomers that were otherwise inaccessible in previous work. Concise asymmetric stereodivergent synthesis of the key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules further showcases the synthetic utility of this methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Volatile Perovskite Precursor Ink Enables Window Printing of Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules in Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a stable volatile precursor ink has been developed, enabling the wide speed window (0.3&#8197;m/min to 18.0&#8197;m/min) printing of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite film in an ambient atmosphere. Ultimately, small&#8208;area FAPbI3 pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#8197;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) achieved remarkable efficiencies of 24.32&#8201;% and 21.90&#8201;%, along with superior operational stability with T90&gt;1350&#8197;h.







Abstract
Despite the great success of perovskite photovoltaics in terms of device efficiency and stability using laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating methods, the demand for high&#8208;throughput and cost&#8208;effective solutions remains unresolved and rarely reported because of the complicated nature of perovskite crystallization. In this work, we propose a stable precursor ink design strategy to control the solvent volatilization and perovskite crystallization to enable the wide speed window printing (0.3 to 18.0&#8197;m/min) of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) in ambient atmosphere. The FAPbI3 perovskite precursor ink uses volatile acetonitrile (ACN) as the main solvent with DMF and DMSO as coordination additives is beneficial to improve the ink stability, inhibit the coffee rings, and the complicated intermediate FAPbI3 phases, delivering high&#8208;quality pin&#8208;hole free and phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite films with large&#8208;scale uniformity. Ultimately, small&#8208;area FAPbI3 pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#8197;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) achieved remarkable efficiencies of 24.32&#8201;% and 21.90&#8201;%, respectively, whereas the PCE of the devices can be maintained at 23.76&#8201;% when the printing speed increases to 18.0&#8197;m/min. Specifically, the unencapsulated device exhibits superior operational stability with T90&gt;1350&#8197;h. This work represents a step towards the scalable, cost&#8208;effective manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaics with both high performance and high throughput.

         <title>Cross&#8208;domain Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility of mid&#8208;block and chiral block is critical to the cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer in ABC*&#8208;type chiral triblock terpolymers. When the mid&#8208;block is compatible with the chiral block, chirality could transfer through the mid&#8208;domains with limited thickness. In contrast, as the mid&#8208;block is incompatible with the chiral block, chiral interactions will be restricted, independent with the length of mid&#8208;block.







Abstract
Chirality transfer is essential to acquire helical hierarchical superstructures from the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular materials. By taking advantage of chirality transfers at different length scales through intra&#8208;chain and inter&#8208;chain chiral interactions, helical phase (H*) can be formed from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral block copolymers (BCPs*). In this study, chiral triblock terpolymers, polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA), and polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;P4VP&#8208;PLLA) are synthesized for self&#8208;assembly. For PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA with an achiral PEO mid&#8208;block that is compatible with PLLA (chiral end&#8208;block), H* can be formed while the block length is below a critical value. By contrast, for the one with achiral P4VP mid&#8208;block that is incompatible with PLLA, the formation of H* phase would be suppressed regardless of the length of the mid&#8208;block, giving cylinder phase. Those results elucidate a new type of chirality transfer across the phase domain that is referred as cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer, providing complementary understanding of the chirality transfer at the interface of phase&#8208;separated domains.

         <title>Degradable Block Copolymer Nanoparticles Synthesized by Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes developments in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles, synthesized by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The high production efficiency of PISA coupled with degradability provides the next generation of particulate materials that can better serve the need for sustainability.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) combines polymerization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers in one system and has become a widely used method to prepare block copolymer nanoparticles at high concentrations. The persistence of polymers in the environment poses a huge threat to the ecosystem and represents a significant waste of resources. There is an urgent need to develop novel chemical approaches to synthesize degradable polymers. To meet with this demand, it is crucial to install degradability into PISA nanoparticles. Most recently, degradable PISA nanoparticles have been synthesized by introducing degradation mechanisms into either shell&#8208;forming or core&#8208;forming blocks. This Minireview summarizes the development in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles synthesized by PISA, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable, and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles. Future development will benefit from expansion of polymerization techniques with new degradation mechanisms and adaptation of high&#8208;throughput approaches for both PISA syntheses and degradation studies.

         <title>Catalytic Protein Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic inhibitors (CIs) mediate some type of post&#8208;translational modification that inactivates the target protein. This can provide a substantial increase in potency relative to occupancy&#8208;driven inhibitors. This article reviews the development of this field, current applications in targeted protein degradation, and design considerations for non&#8208;degradative CIs.







Abstract
Many of the highest priority targets in a wide range of disease states are difficult&#8208;to&#8208;drug proteins. The development of reversible small molecule inhibitors for the active sites of these proteins with sufficient affinity and residence time on&#8208;target is an enormous challenge. This has engendered interest in strategies to increase the potency of a given protein inhibitor by routes other than further improvement in gross affinity. Amongst these, the development of catalytic protein inhibitors has garnered the most attention and investment, particularly with respect to protein degraders, which catalyze the destruction of the target protein. This article discusses the genesis of the burgeoning field of catalytic inhibitors, the current state of the art, and exciting future directions.

         <title>Isonitriles as Alkyl Radical Precursors in Visible Light Mediated Hydro&#8208; and Deuterodeamination Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in visible&#8208;light mediated hydro&#8208; and deuterodeamination reactions. Most examples only require visible&#8208;light irradiation of the isonitrile in the presence of a silyl radical precursor, although a significant acceleration was observed in the presence of an organic photocatalyst. The method is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and is general for C&#945;&#8208;primary, C&#945;&#8208;secondary and C&#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl isonitriles.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in light&#8208;mediated hydro&#8208; and deuterodeamination reactions. The reaction is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and potential to be used in late&#8208;stage functionalization.

&lt;p&gt;We report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in visible-light mediated hydro- and deuterodeamination reactions. Most examples only require visible-light irradiation of the isonitrile in the presence of a silyl radical precursor, although a significant acceleration was observed in the presence of an organic photocatalyst. The method is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and is general for C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;-primary, C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;-secondary and C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;-tertiary alkyl isonitriles.

         <title>Atomically Precise Silver Clusters Stabilized by Lacunary Polyoxometalates with Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two atomically precise Ag clusters stabilized by lacunary polyoxometalates have been successfully synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach, the resulting POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters have been pioneeringly investigated as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high selectivity.







Abstract
The syntheses of atomically precise silver (Ag) clusters stabilized by multidentate lacunary polyoxometalate (POM) ligands have been emerging as a promising but challenging research direction, the combination of redox&#8208;active POM ligands and silver clusters will render them unexpected geometric structures and catalytic properties. Herein, we report the successful construction of two structurally&#8208;new lacunary POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters, TBA6H14Ag14(DPPB)4(CH3CN)9[Ag24(Si2W18O66)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10CH3CN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O ({Ag24(Si2W18O66)3}, TBA=tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium, DPPB=1,4&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)butane) and TBA14H6Ag9Na2(H2O)9[Ag27(Si2W18O66)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8CH3CN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O ({Ag27(Si2W18O66)3}), using a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Under otherwise identical synthetic conditions, the molecular structures of two POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters could be readily tuned by the addition of different organic ligands. In both compounds, the central trefoil&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped {Ag24}14+ and {Ag27}17+ clusters bearing 10 delocalized valence electrons are stabilized by three C&#8208;shaped {Si2W18O66} units. The femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed the rapid charge transfer between {Ag24}14+ core and {Si2W18O66} ligands. Both compounds have been pioneeringly investigated as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high selectivity.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethoxylation of Silyl Enol Ethers and Allyl Silanes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free trifluoromethoxylation methods of alkenyl substrates under mild conditions have been developed using bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and relatively atom&#8208;economical reagent. Silyl enol ether substrates react to form either &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)ketones or OCF3&#8208;containing silyl enol ethers depending on the solvent used while allyl silanes afford unprecedented allyl(trifluoromethyl)ethers.







Abstract
Radical trifluoromethoxylation is an attractive approach to prepare compounds featuring the important OCF3 group, however most existing methods have focused on aromatic substrates. Here, we report novel methodologies with alkenyl substrates employing bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and comparatively atom economical trifluoromethoxylating reagent. With silyl enol ether substrates, switching reaction solvent allows for the synthesis of either &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)ketone products or unprecedented alkenyl&#8208;OCF3 species. Furthermore, allyl silanes have been employed as substrates for the first time, affording allyl(trifluoromethyl)ether products in good yields. In each case, the methods operate at room temperature without large excesses of the alkene substrate while, in contrast to previous radical trifluoromethoxylation reactions, no catalyst, light or other activators are required.

         <dc:description>
The cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;NHK (Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi) reaction of ketimine has been realized to access diverse &#945;&#8208;tertiary vinylic amino esters with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Notably, both configuration of alkenyl halide provides the same stereochemical outcome of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkenyl quaternary amino ester, indicating that isomerization of alkenyl fragment might be involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Chromium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction represents one of the most powerful approaches for the formation of chiral carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond. However, the construction of sterically encumbered tetrasubstituted stereocenter through NHK reaction still posts a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;NHK reaction of ketimine with alkenyl halide to provide a convenient synthetic approach for the manufacture of enantioenriched tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;vinylic amino acid. This protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance with excellent 99&#8201;% ee in most cases. Additionally, this asymmetric reductive method is also applicable to the aldimine to access the trisubstituted stereogenic centers.

         <title>Dynamic in situ Formation of Cu2O Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters through Photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling's Reaction for Selective and Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic Cu2O nanoclusters are operando constructed by a photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling&#8208;reaction, which work as the true active sites for sustainable nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photosynthesis.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) is evidenced to be effective for constructing advanced catalysts. In particular, Cu2O is identified to be active for general catalytic reactions. However, conflicting results regarding the true structure&#8208;activity correlations between Cu2O&#8208;based active sites and efficiencies are usually reported. The structure of Cu2O undergoes dynamic evolution rather than remaining stable under working conditions, in which the actual reaction cannot proceed over the prefabricated Cu2O sites. Therefore, the dynamic construction of Cu2O active sites can be developed to promote catalytic efficiency and reveal the true structure&#8208;activity correlations. Herein, by introducing the redox pairs of Cu2+ and reducing sugar into a photocatalysis system, it is clarified that the Cu2O sub&#8208;nanoclusters (NCs), working as novel active sites, are on&#8208;site constructed on the substrate via a photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling's route. The realistic interfacial charge separation and transformation capacities are remarkably promoted by the dynamic Cu2O NCs under the actual catalysis condition, which achieves a milestone efficiency for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photosynthesis, including the targets of production rate (1.98&#177;0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;gCu&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), conversion ratio (94.2&#177;0.91&#8201;%), and selectivity (98.6&#8201;%&#177;0.55&#8201;%). The current work develops an effective strategy for integrating the active site construction into realistic reactions, providing new opportunities for Cu&#8208;based chemistry and catalysis sciences research.

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanoclusters are operando constructed by a photoinduced pseudo-Fehling-reaction, which work as the true active sites for sustainable nitrate-to-ammonia photosynthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper (Cu) is evidenced to be effective for constructing advanced catalysts. In particular, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is identified to be active for general catalytic reactions. However, conflicting results regarding the true structure-activity correlations between Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-based active sites and efficiencies are usually reported. The structure of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O undergoes dynamic evolution rather than remaining stable under working conditions, in which the actual reaction cannot proceed over the prefabricated Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O sites. Therefore, the dynamic construction of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O active sites can be developed to promote catalytic efficiency and reveal the true structure-activity correlations. Herein, by introducing the redox pairs of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and reducing sugar into a photocatalysis system, it is clarified that the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O sub-nanoclusters (NCs), working as novel active sites, are on-site constructed on the substrate via a photoinduced &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-Fehling's route. The realistic interfacial charge separation and transformation capacities are remarkably promoted by the dynamic Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O NCs under the actual catalysis condition, which achieves a milestone efficiency for nitrate-to-ammonia photosynthesis, including the targets of production rate (1.98&#177;0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Cu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), conversion ratio (94.2&#177;0.91&#8201;%), and selectivity (98.6&#8201;%&#177;0.55&#8201;%). The current work develops an effective strategy for integrating the active site construction into realistic reactions, providing new opportunities for Cu-based chemistry and catalysis sciences research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyurethane with &#946;&#8208;Selenocarbonyl Structure Enabling the Combination of Plastic Degradation and Waste Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selenium&#8208;containing polyurethane materials are degraded into selenium fertilizers for selenium&#8208;rich plant cultivation and further improvement of selenium&#8208;deficiency within humans via selenoxide elimination reaction, achieving both the degradation and upcycling of plastic waste, offering a more sustainable plastic economy.







Abstract
Degradable polymers offer a promising solution to mitigate global plastic pollution, but the degraded products often suffer from diminished value. Upcycling is a more sustainable approach to upgrade polymer waste into value&#8208;added products. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208;selenocarbonyl&#8208;containing polyurethane (SePU), which can be directly degraded under mild conditions into valuable selenium fertilizers for selenium&#8208;rich vegetable cultivation globally, enabling both plastic degradation and waste upcycling. Under oxidation condition, this polymer can be easily and selectively degraded via selenoxide elimination reaction from mixed plastic waste. The degraded product can serve as effective selenium fertilizers to increase selenium content in radish and pak choi. The SePU exhibits excellent mechanical properties. Additionally, we observed the formation of spherulites&#8208;like selenium particles within the materials during degradation for the first time. Our research offers a successful application of selenoxide elimination reaction in the field of plastic degradation for the first time, endowing plastics with both degradability and high reusable value. This strategy provides a promising solution to reduce pollution and improve economy and sustainability of plastics.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Multiple Resonance Distribution Regions of a B,N&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon to Customize Its BT2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrapure green emitter was successfully prepared by precisely regulating multiple resonance (MR) distribution regions. The optimized top&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode simultaneously achieved a record&#8208;high current efficiency of 226.4 cd A&#8208;1, an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum of 16&#8197;nm, a nearly BT2020 green color (CIE: 0.14, 0.79), and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Recently, boron (B)/nitrogen (N)&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by multiple resonances (MR), have attracted significant attention owing to their remarkable features of efficient narrowband emissions with small full width at half maxima (FWHMs). However, developing ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;green emitters that comply with the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT2020) standard remains challenging. Precise regulation of the MR distribution regions allows simultaneously achieving the emission maximum, FWHM value, and spectral shape that satisfy the BT2020 standard. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule TPABO&#8208;DICz exhibited ultrapure green emission with a dominant peak at 515&#8197;nm, an extremely small FWHM of 17&#8197;nm, and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.76). The corresponding bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a remarkably high CIEy value (0.74) and maximum external quantum efficiency (25.8&#8201;%). Notably, the top&#8208;emitting OLED achieved nearly BT2020 green color (CIE: 0.14, 0.79) and exhibited a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art maximum current efficiency of 226.4 cd A&#8722;1, thus fully confirming the effectiveness of the above strategy.

         <title>Identification of Crucial Photosensitizing Factors to Promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of Ir(III)&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) were prepared as a molecular platform to identify the crucial factors to maximize the photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The dinuclear PS Ir&#8208;6 was over 54&#8197;times better than typical PS Ir&#8208;1 with a turnover number of up to 28160 under optimal conditions. Detailed investigations revealed that the incremental strong&#8208;visible&#8208;light absorption capacity by molecular structure&#8208;tuning is a crucial factor to boost CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The sensitizing ability of a catalytic system is closely related to the visible&#8208;light absorption ability, excited&#8208;state lifetime, redox potential, and electron&#8208;transfer rate of photosensitizers (PSs), however it remains a great challenge to concurrently mediate these factors to boost CO2 photoreduction. Herein, a series of Ir(III)&#8208;based PSs (Ir&#8208;1&#8211;Ir&#8208;6) were prepared as molecular platforms to understand the interplay of these factors and identify the primary factors for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Among them, less efficient visible&#8208;light absorption capacity results in lower CO yields of Ir&#8208;1, Ir&#8208;2 or Ir&#8208;4. Ir&#8208;3 shows the most efficient photocatalytic activity among these mononuclear PSs due to some comprehensive parameters. Although the Kobs of Ir&#8208;3 is &#8776;10&#8197;times higher than that of Ir&#8208;5, the CO yield of Ir&#8208;3 is slightly higher than that of Ir&#8208;5 due to the compensation of Ir&#8208;5&#8217;s strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing ability. Ir&#8208;6 exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance due to the strong visible&#8208;light absorption ability, comparable thermodynamic driving force, and electron transfer rate among these PSs. Remarkably, the CO2 photoreduction to CO with Ir&#8208;6 can achieve 91.5&#8197;&#956;mol, over 54&#8197;times higher than Ir&#8208;1, and the optimized TONC&#8208;1 can reach up to 28160. Various photophysical properties of the PSs were concurrently adjusted by fine ligand modification to promote CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;bridging Nitrogen Coordination in Carbon&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;universal Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique supermolecule assembly&#8208;profile coating strategy was proposed to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites (e.g., metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon) have been deemed as promising alternatives for noble&#8208;metal catalysts in couples of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the modulation of such atomic sites and the understanding of their interactions are still highly challenging. Herein, we propose a unique supermolecule assembly&#8208;profile coating strategy to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources. The detailed microstructure analysis revealed that the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon sites with four&#8208; (Zn&#8722;N4) and five&#8208;coordination (Fe&#8722;N5) via the nitrogen coordination are similar to the cytochrome c oxidases. For promising electrocatalysis, such unique microstructure is able to activate oxygen molecules due to nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites, thus leading to efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction in alkaline, neutral, and acid electrolytes. Especially, zinc group elements (e.g., Zn and Cd) with d10 electron configuration would significantly boost the nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.

The proof-of-concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) consisting of a carbazole donor and a small amount of ionic acceptor have been realized. The polymer exhibits LPL without dopants and has higher phase stability than small molecule mixtures. The LPL can be observed even in air and at high temperatures&#160;below the glass transition temperature.







Abstract
Organic materials exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission in the near infrared are expected to have applications in bio&#8208;imaging and other areas. Although room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence display long&#8208;lived emission of approximately one minute, organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems with a similar emission mechanism to inorganic persistent emitters can emit for several hours at room temperature. In particular OLPL with a hole&#8208;diffusion mechanism can function even in the presence of oxygen. However, ionic materials lack long&#8208;term stability in neutral organic host owing to aggregation and phase separation. In this study, we synthesized polymers with stable near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence at room temperature via the copolymerization of electron donors and acceptors. The copolymers exhibit long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) at temperatures below the glass transition temperature and can be excited by approximately the entire range of visible light. LPL properties and spectra can be controlled by the dopant.

         <title>Designing and Engineering Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for CO2 to CO Conversion: From Single to Dual Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts are discussed from single to dual metal sites for CO2 to CO conversion. In particular, designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to break the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Challenges and solutions of CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors are highlighted for improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to achieving sustainable electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion and storage while decarbonizing the emission&#8208;heavy industry. The carbon&#8208;supported, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated, and atomically dispersed metal sites are effective catalysts for CO generation due to their high activity, selectivity, and earth abundance. Here, we discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts from single to dual metal sites. Engineering single metal sites using a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon model was highlighted to exclusively study the effect of carbon particle sizes, metal contents, and M&#8722;N bond structures in the form of MN4 moieties on catalytic activity and selectivity. The structure&#8208;property correlation was analyzed by combining experimental results with theoretical calculations to uncover the CO2 to CO conversion mechanisms. Furthermore, dual&#8208;metal site catalysts, inheriting the merits of single&#8208;metal sites, have emerged as a new frontier due to their potentially enhanced catalytic properties. Designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to alter the surface adsorption to CO2 and various intermediates, thus breaking the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors was discussed to provide insights into the electrolyzer design with improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Azahomocorannulenyl Cations and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tropyl ions and radicals are representative non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons that offer interesting properties, but their synthesis has been rather limited. A series of &#960;&#8208;extended azahomocorannulene molecules possessing a tropyl cation or radical unit have now been synthesized and their electronic and optical properties were investigated.







Abstract
Cycloheptatrienyl (tropyl) molecules are representative non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons that offer interesting chemistry because of their unique structures and properties. However, there have been a limited number of polycyclic aromatic tropyl cations and radicals reported in the literature. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of azahomocorannulene derivatives, where the key reactions are a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylides with dibenzotropone and a subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the obtained azahomocorannulenyl cation and radical adopt planar structures and exhibit unique packing structures. Their electronic and optical properties were investigated experimentally and theoretically to reveal their aromatic character.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR&#8208;T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy&#160;based on the durable&#160;catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side&#8208;effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune&#8208;regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune&#8208;response activations by nanocatalytic medicine&#8208;initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti&#8208;tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress&#160;in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potentials and broad prospects of nanocatalysis&#8208;based anti&#8208;tumor immune&#8208;therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Uniformly Distributed Mixed Matrix Membranes via a Solution Processable Strategy for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocomposite named as ZIF&#8208;67@Ag4tz4 was introduced into 6FDA&#8208;TMPDA to give advanced mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for propylene/propane separation. The dual&#8208;facilitated mechanism (facilitate transport and molecular sieving) of the nanocomposite results in a significantly improved propylene/propane selectivity, which was clarified with the help of computational studies.







Abstract
Aggregation of filler particles during the formation of mixed matrix membranes is difficult to avoid when filler loadings exceed a 10&#8211;15&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Such agglomeration usually leads to poor membrane performance. In this work, using a ZIF&#8208;67 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as filler along with surface modification of Ag4tz4 to improve processability and selective olefin adsorption, we demonstrate that highly loaded with a very low agglomeration degree membranes can be synthesized displaying unmatched separation selectivity (39) for C3H6/C3H8 mixtures and high permeability rates (99&#8197;Barrer), far surpassing previous reports in the literature. Through molecular dynamics simulation, the enhanced compatibility between ZIF&#8208;67 and polymer matrix with adding Ag4tz4 was proven and the tendency in gas permeability and C3H6 selectivity in the mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were well explained. More importantly, the membrane showed a wide range of pressure and temperature resistance, together with remarkable long&#8208;term stability (&gt;900&#8197;h). The modification method might help solve interface issues in MMMs and can be extended to the fabrication of other fillers to achieve high performance MMMs for gas separation.

         <title>Towards Optical Information Recording: A Robust Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Photoswitch with the Ring&#8208;Closure Reaction Yield Exceeding 96.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven molecular switch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, was facilely synthesized by endcapping the photochromic dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. TPAP&#8722;DTE undergoes a quasi&#8208;quantitative ring&#8208;closure reaction with a yield &gt;96.3&#8201;% upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation. It remains robust even after 100&#8197;photoswitching cycles and 1000&#8208;hour aging test, and demonstrates versatility in optical information recording.







Abstract
Diarylethene molecular photoswitches hold great fascination as optical information materials due to their unique bistability and exceptional reversible photoswitching properties. Conventional diarylethenes, however, rely on UV light for ring&#8208;closure reactions, typically with modest yields. For practical application, diarylethenes driven by visible lights are preferred but achieving high ring&#8208;closure reaction yield remains a significant challenge. Herein, we synthesized a novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, by facilely endcapping the dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. Owing to the electron&#8208;donating conjugation effect of TPAP, the open&#8208;form TPAP&#8722;DTE responds strongly to short&#8208;wavelength visible lights with considerable photocyclization quantum yields and molar absorption coefficient. Upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation, TPAP&#8722;DTE achieves a ring&#8208;closure reaction yield exceeding 96.3&#8201;% (confirmed by both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography). Its ring&#8208;opening reaction yield is 100&#8201;% upon irradiation with long&#8208;wavelength visible light. TPAP&#8722;DTE could be regarded as a bidirectional &#8220;quasi&#8221;&#8208;quantitative conversion molecular switch. Furthermore, TPAP&#8722;DTE exhibits robust fatigue resistance over 100&#8197;full photoswitching cycles and great anti&#8208;aging property under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% humidity for at least 1000&#8197;h. Consequently, its rewritable QR&#8208;code, multilevel data storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications are successfully demonstrated exclusively using visible lights, positioning TPAP&#8722;DTE as a highly promising medium for information recording.

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Human ALKBH3 Mediated RNA N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct RNA m1A substrate recognition and demethylation catalytic mechanisms of ALKBH3 were reported. It utilized a non&#8208;conserved &#946;&#8208;hairpin as well as two bubble regions inside the active pocket generated by two key residues Asp194 and Thr133 to achieve single stranded substrates preferential recognition and demethylation catalysis.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent post&#8208;transcriptional RNA modification, and the distribution and dynamics of the modification play key epitranscriptomic roles in cell development. At present, the human AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family member ALKBH3 is the only known mRNA m1A demethylase, but its catalytic mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the structures of ALKBH3&#8208;oligo crosslinked complexes obtained with the assistance of a synthetic antibody crystallization chaperone. Structural and biochemical results showed that ALKBH3 utilized two &#946;&#8208;hairpins (&#946;4&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;5 and &#946;&#8242;&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;&#8242;&#8242;) and the &#945;2 helix to facilitate single&#8208;stranded substrate binding. Moreover, a bubble&#8208;like region around Asp194 and a key residue inside the active pocket (Thr133) enabled specific recognition and demethylation of m1A&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C)&#8208;modified substrates. Mutation of Thr133 to the corresponding residue in the AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family members FTO or ALKBH5 converted ALKBH3 substrate selectivity from m1A to N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A), as did Asp194 deletion. Our findings provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms of substrate recognition and m1A demethylation by ALKBH3. This study is expected to aid structure&#8208;guided design of chemical probes for further functional studies and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel Hybrid Aromatic Metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes Constructed by a Formal [10+1] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity, were constructed by a one pot [10+1] strategy. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their special aromaticity was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically. This work provides a method to construct large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes, which is significant for metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry.







Abstract
Aromatic metalla&#8208;annulenes are important aromatic compounds, research into which has been mainly concentrated on metal&#8208;benzenes and their lower homologues. Reports on their superior homologs are rare, and this has greatly limited the systematic study of their properties. In this work, a series of osma&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with good air and thermal stability were prepared in high yields through a simple [10+1] strategy, by incorporating a metal fragment into conjugated ten&#8208;carbon chains in a one&#8208;pot reaction. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity is supported by various physical and computational parameters. Besides, these complexes show versatile reactivities, not only giving further evidence for their aromaticity, but also demonstrating their physical and chemical properties can easily be regulated. This work enriches the metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry, and provides a new avenue for the synthesis of large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes.

         <title>Discrimination of Disaccharide Isomers of Different Glycosidic Linkages Using a Modified MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MspA nanopore was applied to discriminate between disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages. An overall identification accuracy of 99&#8201;% was achieved, suggesting its potential use in the determination of glycosidic linkage and chemical analysis.







Abstract
Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide subunits joined by a glycosidic linkage in an &#945; or &#946; configuration. Different combinations of isomeric monosaccharide subunits and different glycosidic linkages result in different isomeric disaccharide products. Thus, direct discrimination of these disaccharide isomers from a mixture is extremely difficult. In this paper, a hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) nanopore conjugated with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adapter was applied for disaccharide sensing, with which three most widely known disaccharides in nature, including sucrose, lactose and maltose, were clearly discriminated. Besides, all six isomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;fructoses, differing only in their glycosidic linkages, were also well resolved. Assisted by a custom machine learning algorithm, a 0.99 discrimination accuracy is achieved. Nanopore discrimination of disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages, which has never been previously demonstrated, is inspiring for nanopore saccharide sequencing. This sensing capacity was also applied in direct identification of isomaltulose additives in a commercial sucrose&#8208;free yogurt, from which isomaltulose, lactose and L&#8208;lactic acid were simultaneously detected.

         <title>Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Aqueous Micellar Organometallic Catalysis: Methane Functionalization as a Case Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Dynamics have been applied to the study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic micellar system, in the first example of such investigations using a methane functionalization case.







Abstract
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations constitute a powerful tool that provides a 3D perspective of the dynamical behavior of chemical systems. Herein the first MD study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic system, in micellar media, is presented. The challenging methane catalytic functionalization into ethyl propionate through a silver&#8208;catalyzed process has been targeted as the case study. The intimate nature of the micelles formed with the surfactants sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been ascertained, as well as the relative distribution of the main actors in this transformation, namely methane, the diazo reagent and the silver catalyst, the latter in two different forms: the initial compound and a silver&#8208;carbene intermediate. Catalyst deactivation occurs with halide containing surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and Triton X&#8208;100. Computed simulations allow explaining the experimental results, indicating that micelles behave differently regarding the degree of accumulation and the local distribution of the reactants and their effect in the molecular collisions leading to net reaction.

         <title>Multicomponent Cyclizative 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement Enabled Enantioselective Construction of 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Pyrrolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangement is established, which provides a straightforward access to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolinones in excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. This reaction also represents the first example of asymmetric catalytic construction of chiral pyrrolinones bearing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenters.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;rearrangement reaction is one of the most important approaches to construct carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in organic synthesis. However, the development of catalytic asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is still far from mature and often suffers from problems such as complex substrates, single product structure, and lack of synthetic application. Multicomponent reaction has been recognized as a robust tool for the synthesis of diverse and tunable products from readily available starting material. Conceptionally and practically, the development of multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is highly desirable. In this regard, we report herein a three&#8208;component benzilic acid&#8208;type rearrangement of 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, aromatic amines and aldehydes for the asymmetric construction of synthetically challenging pyrrolinones bearing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. To the best of our knowledge, this reaction represents the first example of organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements.

         <title>Thermolysis of Biphenylene toward Cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of arylated biphenylenes provides one&#8208;step access to [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) while avoiding linear oligomers. Solubilizing substituents allow separation of these macrocycles by recycling&#8208;GPC. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of biphenylenes at 350&#8201;&#176;C furnishes [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) in one step and in high yields. At 400&#8201;&#176;C biphenylene dimerizes into tetraphenylene, but lower reaction temperatures produce cyclooligomers. If suitably substituted, the oligomers are soluble and can be isolated and characterized. The products are exclusively cyclic. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.

         <title>A Catalytic Method to Activate Nitromethane by the Cooperation of Homo&#8208; and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic activation of bulk chemical nitromethane (MeNO2) enables the facile synthesis of amides and nitriles from ketone, aldehyde, and alkyne substrates. This method eliminates the need for stoichiometric reductants or activators, opening up new possibilities for MeNO2 as a nitrogen source in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The achievement of directly activating and utilizing bulk small molecules has remained a longstanding objective in the field of chemical synthesis. The present work reports a catalytic activation method for bulk chemical nitromethane (MeNO2). This method combines homogeneous Lewis acid with recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, featuring practicality, sustainability, and low cost, thus solving the inherent drawbacks of previous Nef processes where stoichiometric reductants or activators were required. By combining the advantages of both homo&#8208; and heterogeneous catalysts, this chemistry may not only offer new opportunities for the further development of MeNO2 as a nitrogen source for organic synthesis, but also promote the catalysis design in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Quantitative N&#8208; or C&#8208;Terminal Labelling of Proteins with Unactivated Peptides by Use of Sortases and a d&#8208;Aminopeptidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalised coupling strategy to enable quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unmodified peptides and readily produced catalysts is described. For C&#8208;terminal labelling, a small excess of the labelling peptide is required, but for N&#8208;terminal labelling, equimolar quantities of labelling reagents can be used to achieve quantitative labelling.







Abstract
Quantitative and selective labelling of proteins is widely used in both academic and industrial laboratories, and catalytic labelling of proteins using transpeptidases, such as sortases, has proved to be a popular strategy for such selective modification. A major challenge for this class of enzymes is that the majority of procedures require an excess of the labelling reagent or, alternatively, activated substrates rather than simple commercially sourced peptides. We report the use of a coupled enzyme strategy which enables quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unactivated labelling peptides. The use of an aminopeptidase in conjunction with a transpeptidase allows sequence&#8208;specific degradation of the peptide by&#8208;product, shifting the equilibrium to favor product formation, which greatly enhances the reaction efficiency. Subsequent optimisation of the reaction allows N&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using essentially equimolar ratios of peptide label to protein and C&#8208;terminal labelling with only a small excess. Minimizing the amount of substrate required for quantitative labelling has the potential to improve industrial processes and facilitate the use of transpeptidation as a method for protein labelling.

&lt;p&gt;A generalised coupling strategy to enable quantitative N- and C-terminal labelling of proteins using unmodified peptides and readily produced catalysts is described. For C-terminal labelling, a small excess of the labelling peptide is required, but for N-terminal labelling, equimolar quantities of labelling reagents can be used to achieve quantitative labelling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantitative and selective labelling of proteins is widely used in both academic and industrial laboratories, and catalytic labelling of proteins using transpeptidases, such as sortases, has proved to be a popular strategy for such selective modification. A major challenge for this class of enzymes is that the majority of procedures require an excess of the labelling reagent or, alternatively, activated substrates rather than simple commercially sourced peptides. We report the use of a coupled enzyme strategy which enables quantitative N- and C-terminal labelling of proteins using unactivated labelling peptides. The use of an aminopeptidase in conjunction with a transpeptidase allows sequence-specific degradation of the peptide by-product, shifting the equilibrium to favor product formation, which greatly enhances the reaction efficiency. Subsequent optimisation of the reaction allows N-terminal labelling of proteins using essentially equimolar ratios of peptide label to protein and C-terminal labelling with only a small excess. Minimizing the amount of substrate required for quantitative labelling has the potential to improve industrial processes and facilitate the use of transpeptidation as a method for protein labelling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Benzils Achieved by Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular polymerization provides a novel and effective approach for developing circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, which combines inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities with intense and color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized phosphorescent signals.







Abstract
In current approaches for circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, the crystallization of chiral phosphors suffers from poor processability, while integrating them into an amorphous polymer matrix results in unsatisfactory chiroptical signals due to the absence of chirality communication. Here, we have developed an innovative strategy through chiral supramolecular polymerization of benzil phosphors facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities of non&#8208;covalent supramolecular polymers obviate the need for an external polymer matrix. The pronounced helical asymmetry of benzil phosphors resulting from chiral supramolecular polymerization leads to enhanced circularly polarized phosphorescence compared to their non&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonded counterparts. The circularly polarized phosphorescent signals can be further modulated by varying the location of stereogenic centers or introducing halogen bonding to benzils. Incorporation of platinum(II) phosphor into the benzil supramolecular polymers induces both chirality and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, leading to a change in circularly polarized phosphorescent color from yellow to red. In summary, chiral supramolecular polymerization of phosphors represents a novel and effective approach to circularly polarized phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Effect of Alkali&#8208; and Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Promoters on Silica&#8208;Supported Co&#8722;Fe Alloy for Autocatalytic CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;promoted Co&#8722;Fe bimetallic catalysts on silica can convert CO2 and H2O to crucial metabolites such as formate, acetate, pyruvate as well as hydrocarbons under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. With alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth metals abundant in hydrothermal vents, our study simulates how the geochemical process can fix CO2 before biochemical CO2 fixation would come into play.







Abstract
Hydrothermal vents harbor numerous microbial communities rich in reduced carbon species such as formate, acetate, and hydrocarbons. Such essential chemicals for life are produced by H2&#8208;dependent CO2 reduction, where serpentinization provides continuous H2 and thermal energy. Here, we show that silica&#8208;supported bimetallic Co&#8722;Fe alloys, naturally occurring minerals around serpentinite, can convert CO2 and H2O to key metabolic intermediates of the acetyl coenzyme A pathway such as formate (up to 72&#8197;mM), acetate, and pyruvate under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons up to C6 including propene are also detected, just as in the Lost City hydrothermal field. The effects of promoters on structural properties and catalytic functionalities of the Co&#8722;Fe alloy are systematically investigated by incorporating a series of alkali and alkaline earth metals including Na, Mg, K, and Ca. Alkali and alkaline earth metals resulted in higher formate concentrations when dissolved in water and increased reaction pH, while alkaline earth metals also favored the formation of insoluble hydroxides and carbonates similar to the constituent minerals of the chimneys at the Lost City hydrothermal fields.

         <title>Grain Boundary Tailors the Local Chemical Environment on Iridium Surface for Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain Boundary induced the formation of a local acid&#8208;like environment with H3O+ intermediates on the iridium surface, which lowered the energy barrier for water dissociation and promoted the generation of hydrogen spillover to synergistically enhance the hydrogen evolution activity.







Abstract
Even though grain boundaries (GBs) have been previously employed to increase the number of active catalytic sites or tune the binding energies of reaction intermediates for promoting electrocatalytic reactions, the effect of GBs on the tailoring of the local chemical environment on the catalyst surface has not been clarified thus far. In this study, a GBs&#8208;enriched iridium (GB&#8722;Ir) was synthesized and examined for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Operando Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a local acid&#8208;like environment with H3O+ intermediates was created in the GBs region owing to the electron&#8208;enriched surface Ir atoms at the GBs. The H3O+ intermediates lowered the energy barrier for water dissociation and provided enough hydrogen proton to promote the generation of hydrogen spillover from the sites at the GBs to the sites away from the GBs, thus synergistically enhancing the hydrogen evolution activity. Notably, the GB&#8722;Ir catalyst exhibited a high alkaline HER activity (10&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). We believe that our findings will promote further research on GBs and the surface science of electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Realizing Low&#8208;Temperature Graphite&#8208;based Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational electrolyte design, highly reversible low&#8208;temperature potassium storage in graphite anode has been achieved for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared graphite&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion full battery can reversibly charge/discharge in a wide temperature range between &#8722;30 and 45&#8201;&#176;C with a considerable energy density of 197&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode &#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr) has been considered as the most promising anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) commercialization due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, Gr&#8208;based PIBs remain unfeasible at low temperature (LT), suffering from either poor kinetics based on conventional carbonate electrolytes or K+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation issue based on typical ether electrolytes. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Gr&#8208;based LT rechargeable PIB is realized for the first time by electrolyte chemistry. Applying unidentate&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecule as the solvent dramatically weakens the K+&#8208;solvent interactions and lowers corresponding K+ de&#8208;solvation kinetic barrier. Meanwhile, introduction of steric hindrance suppresses co&#8208;intercalation of K+&#8208;solvent into Gr, greatly elevating operating voltage and cyclability of the full battery. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Gr||prepotassiated 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylicacid&#8208;dianhydride (KPTCDA) full PIB can reversibly charge/discharge between &#8722;30 and 45&#8201;&#176;C with a considerable energy density up to 197&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, hopefully facilitating the development of LT PIBs.

Methanol steam reforming (MSR) to hydrogen (H2) is seriously obstructed by the high reaction temperatures and complicated purification processes. We proposed an electrochemical&#8208;assisted methanol steam reforming (EMSR) method to achieve a high hydrogen production rate by coupling the electrochemical reaction within MSR in a polymer electrolyte membrane reactor at low temperatures.







Abstract
Methanol steam reforming (MSR) provides an alternative way for efficient production and safe transportation of hydrogen but requires harsh conditions and complicated purification processes. In this work, an efficient electrochemical&#8208;assisted MSR reaction for pure H2 production at lower temperature (~140&#8201;&#176;C) is developed by coupling the electrocatalysis reaction into the MSR in a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis reactor. By electrochemically assisted, the two critical steps including the methanol dehydrogenation and water&#8208;gas shift reaction are accelerated, which is attributed to decreasing the methanol dehydrogenation energy and promoting the dissociation of H2O to OH* by the applied potential. Furthermore, the reduced H2 partial pressure by the hydrogen oxidation and reduction process further promotes MSR. The combination of these advantages not only efficiently decreases the MSR temperature but also achieves the high rate of hydrogen production of 505&#8197;mmol&#8201;H2&#8201;g&#8201;Pt&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with exceptionally high H2 selectivity (99&#8201;%) at 180&#8201;&#176;C and a low voltage (0.4&#8197;V), and the productivity is about 30&#8208;fold than that of traditional MSR. This study opens up a new avenue to design novel electrolysis cells for hydrogen production.

         <title>Regiodivergent Arylation of Pyridines via Zincke Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylation of pyridines is possible through ring&#8208;opened Zincke imines. A Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type process is selective for the C4 position, while a metal&#8208;free arylation using an iodonium salt addresses the C5&#8208;position. Sequential triflation, arylation, and pyridine recyclization enables the process to be conducted in one pot, representing a new approach to valuable biaryl structures.







Abstract
An arylation protocol for pyridines is described, via the ring&#8208;opened Zincke intermediate. Treatment of pyridines with triflic anhydride and a secondary amine produces an azahexatriene species, which undergoes regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation at the putative C4 position. Recyclization then provides the pyridine products. Alternatively, metal&#8208;free arylation with a diaryliodonium salt is selective for the pyridine meta&#8208;position, affording a regiodivergent approach to pyridine biaryls from a common intermediate.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Nitroalkanes with (Hetero)aryl Bromides/Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of nitroalkanes with (hetero)aryl/alkenyl halides (Br, I) is described here. The method is relied on using some newly developed oxalamide ligands, and gives coupling products in great diversity. Since the coupling products can be conveniently transformed into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl amines, ketones, carboxylic acids and aldehydes, our method provides a highly competitive approach for preparing these compounds from readily available (hetero)aryl halides.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aryl substituted nitroalkanes are valuable synthetic building blocks that can be easily converted into &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, as well as amines. Herein, an efficient Cu/oxalamide&#8208;catalyzed coupling between nitroalkanes and (hetero)aryl halides (Br, I) was developed to direct access highly diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted nitroalkanes. Compared with the current state of art, this protocol is more environmentally friendly and practical for synthetic chemists. This approach is characterized by a broad substrate scope on both nitroalkane part (primary nitroalkanes and nitromethane) and sp2 halide part ((hetero)aryl bromides/iodides and alkenyl bromides/iodides). The excellent functional group tolerance was observed, which would enable real world synthetic applications. More importantly, TON of current transformation reached to 3640, when some aryl iodides were used as coupling partners. This represents currently the highest catalyst turnover for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation of nitroalkanes. Furthermore, the successful application in late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and synthesis of a known retinoid X receptor (RXR) antagonist exemplified its synthetic potential.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;dimensional Layered Composite Carbosilicates from in situ Unzipped Carbon Nanotubes and Exfoliated Bulk Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via unzipping and zipping processes, an ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional layered carbosilicate is obtained by hydrothermal treatment. In a one&#8208;pot reaction, CNT and bulk silica are unzipped by the reaction of iron and water, followed by iron zipping the unzipped species to form the carbosilicate. The unprecedent phenomenon brings us new insight on synergistic chemistry, stimulating the discovery of new structures and materials.







Abstract
A key task in today's inorganic synthetic chemistry is to develop effective reactions, routes, and associated techniques aiming to create new functional materials with specifically desired multilevel structures and properties. Herein, we report an ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional layered composite of graphene ribbon and silicate via a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot reaction, which leads to the creation of a novel carbon&#8208;metal&#8208;silicate hybrid family: carbosilicate. The graphene ribbon is in situ formed by unzipping carbon nanotubes, while the ultrathin silicate is in situ obtained from bulk silica or commercial glass; transition metals (Fe or Ni) oxidized by water act as bridging agent, covalently bonding the two structures. The unprecedented structure combines the superior properties of the silicate and the nanocarbon, which triggers some specific novel properties. All processes during synthesis are complementary to each other. The associated synergistic chemistry could stimulate the discovery of a large class of more interesting, functionalized structures and materials.

         <title>Carboxylated Hexagonal Boron Nitride/Graphene Configuration for Electrosynthesis of High&#8208;Concentration Neutral Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique carboxylated hexagonal boron nitride/graphene (h&#8208;BN/G) heterojunction was fabricated on the commercial activated carbon by combining B/N doping and surface modification. The catalyst reached the electrosynthesis of highly concentrated neutral H2O2 (2.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) under industrial current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) by promoting the O2 adsorption/activation and intermediate stabilization to reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen (O2) reduction reaction (ORR) has great potential to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, but the design of low&#8208;cost and highly active and selective catalysts is greatly challenging for the long&#8208;term H2O2 production under industrial relevant current density, especially under neutral electrolytes. To address this issue, this work constructed a carboxylated hexagonal boron nitride/graphene (h&#8208;BN/G) heterojunction on the commercial activated carbon through the coupling of B, N co&#8208;doping with surface oxygen groups functionalization. The champion catalyst exhibited a high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%), production rate (up to 13.4&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), and Faradaic efficiency (FE, &gt;95&#8201;%). The long&#8208;term H2O2 production under the high current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 caused the cumulative concentration as high as 2.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The combination of in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculation indicated that the carboxylated h&#8208;BN/G configuration promotes the adsorption of O2 and the stabilization of the key intermediates, allowing a low energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of HOOH* release from the active site and thus improving the 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The fast dye degradation by using this electrochemical synthesized H2O2 further illustrated the promising practical application.

A series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks [PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx), x=3, 5, 7, 11] are rationally fabricated through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, which showed excellent performance in catalyzing the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component tandem reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the facile preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones.







Abstract
The non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysed&#8208;multicomponent reactions between flue gas CO2 and cheap industrial raw stocks into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals is a promising manner for the ideal CO2 utilization route. To achieve this, the key fundamental challenge is the rational development of highly efficient and facile reaction pathway while establishing compatible catalytic system. Herein, through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, we report the construction of a series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx) [BPY=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate, TPDC&#8208;NH2=2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid] that can catalyze the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Such assembly endows the MOFs with superhydrophobic microenvironment, superior water resistance and highly stable catalytic site, leading to 21 times higher turnover numbers than that of homogeneous counterparts. Mechanism investigation implied that the substrates can be efficiently enriched by the MOF wall and then the adsorbed amine species act as an extrinsic binding site towards dilute CO2 through their strong preferential formation to carbamate acid. Moreover, density functional theory calculations suggest the tetrahedral geometry of Cu in MOF offers special resistance towards amine poisoning, thus maintaining its high efficiency during the catalytic process.

         <title>Low&#8208;Electronegativity Mn&#8208;Contraction of PtMn Nanodendrites Boosts Oxygen Reduction Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of PtMn alloy nanodendrite catalyst with low&#8208;electronegativity Mn&#8208;contraction is reported herein for boosting the oxygen reduction durability of fuel cells. Density functional theory calculation reveals that PtMn alloys are thermodynamically more stable than PtNi alloys in terms of formation enthalpy and cohesive energy, which is the main reason for achieving superior stability of oxygen reduction and membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Platinum metal (PtM, M=Ni, Fe, Co) alloys catalysts show high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity due to their well&#8208;known strain and ligand effects. However, these PtM alloys usually suffer from a deficient ORR durability in acidic environment as the alloyed metal is prone to be dissolved due to its high electronegativity. Herein, we report a new class of PtMn alloy nanodendrite catalyst with low&#8208;electronegativity Mn&#8208;contraction for boosting the oxygen reduction durability of fuel cells. The moderate strain in PtMn, induced by Mn contraction, yields optimal oxygen reduction activity at 0.53&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Most importantly, we show that relative to well&#8208;known high&#8208;electronegativity Ni&#8208;based Pt alloy counterpart, the PtMn nanodendrite catalyst experiences less transition metals&#8217; dissolution in acidic solution and achieves an outstanding mass activity retention of 96&#8201;% after 10,000 degradation cycles. Density functional theory calculation reveals that PtMn alloys are thermodynamically more stable than PtNi alloys in terms of formation enthalpy and cohesive energy. The PtMn nanodendrite&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly delivers an outstanding peak power density of 1.36&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low Pt loading and high&#8208;performance retention over 50&#8197;h operations at 0.6&#8197;V in H2&#8208;O2 hydrogen fuel cells.

         <title>Single Zn Atoms with Acetate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Enabled Asymmetric Coordination for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acetate&#8208;anion&#8208;directed approach is developed to create asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3O moiety on polymeric carbon nitride (CN/Zn&#8722;OAc) using zinc acetate. The asymmetric coordination modulates the electronic structure of Zn centers, thus facilitating O2 adsorption and the subsequent generation of the key intermediate of *OOH. As a result, CN/Zn&#8722;OAc exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Exploring unique single&#8208;atom sites capable of efficiently reducing O2 to H2O2 while being inert to H2O2 decomposition under light conditions is significant for H2O2 photosynthesis, but it remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile design and fabrication of polymeric carbon nitride (CN) decorated with single&#8208;Zn sites that have tailorable local coordination environments, which is enabled by utilizing different Zn salt anions. Specifically, the O atom from acetate (OAc) anion participates in the coordination of single&#8208;Zn sites on CN, forming asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3O moiety on CN (denoted as CN/Zn&#8722;OAc), in contrast to the obtained Zn&#8722;N4 sites when sulfate (SO4) is adopted (CN/Zn&#8722;SO4). Both experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Zn&#8722;N3O moiety exhibits higher intrinsic activity for O2 reduction to H2O2 than the Zn&#8722;N4 moiety. This is attributed to the asymmetric N/O coordination, which promotes the adsorption of O2 and the formation of the key intermediate *OOH on Zn sites due to their modulated electronic structure. Moreover, it is inactive for H2O2 decomposition under both dark and light conditions. As a result, the optimized CN/Zn&#8722;OAc catalyst exhibits significantly improved photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Degradation of Ergothioneine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ergothioneine is a ubiquitous sulfur&#8208;containing natural product. A dioxygenase and a desulfinase were found to mediate oxidative degradation of ergothioneine in actinobacteria.







Abstract
Ergothioneine is a sulfur&#8208;containing metabolite that is produced by bacteria and fungi, and is absorbed by plants and animals as a micronutrient. Ergothioneine reacts with harmful oxidants, including singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and may therefore protect cells against oxidative stress. Herein we describe two enzymes from actinobacteria that cooperate in the specific oxidative degradation of ergothioneine. The first enzyme is an iron&#8208;dependent thiol dioxygenase that produces ergothioneine sulfinic acid. A crystal structure of ergothioneine dioxygenase from Thermocatellispora tengchongensis reveals many similarities with cysteine dioxygenases, suggesting that the two enzymes share a common mechanism. The second enzyme is a metal&#8208;dependent ergothioneine sulfinic acid desulfinase that produces N&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine and SO2. The discovery that certain actinobacteria contain the enzymatic machinery for O2&#8208;dependent biosynthesis and O2&#8208;dependent degradation of ergothioneine indicates that these organisms may actively manage their ergothioneine content.

         <title>Structural Element of Vitamin U&#8208;Mimicking Antibacterial Polypeptide with Ultrahigh Selectivity for Effectively Treating MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylated sulfonium polypeptides mimicking vitamin U motifs were prepared by NCA ring&#8208;open reaction. Obtained Gx&#8208;PM&#8208;n polypeptides with regulated alkylations and polymerization degrees exhibited an ultrahigh selectivity index of 16000 among the reported AMPs or peptoids and potent anti&#8208;MRSA performances both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit mighty antibacterial properties without inducing drug resistance. Achieving much higher selectivity of AMPs towards bacteria and normal cells has always been a continuous goal to be pursued. Herein, a series of sulfonium&#8208;based polypeptides with different degrees of branching and polymerization were synthesized by mimicking the structure of vitamin U. The polypeptide, G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+, shows both potent antibacterial activity and the highest selectivity index of 16000 among the reported AMPs or peptoids (e.g., the known index of 9600 for recorded peptoid in &#8220;Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 59, 6412.&#8221;), which can be attributed to the high positive charge density of sulfonium and the regulation of hydrophobic chains in the structure. The antibacterial mechanisms of G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ are primarily ascribed to the interaction with the membrane, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and disfunction of ribosomes. Meanwhile, altering the degree of alkylation leads to selective antibacteria against either gram&#8208;positive or gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a mixed&#8208;bacteria model. Additionally, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ exhibited superior efficacy against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to vancomycin. Together, these results show that G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ possesses high biocompatibility and is a potential pharmaceutical candidate in combating bacteria significantly threatening human health.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Molecular Oxygen by 9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Selective Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the molecule of 9&#8208;fluorenone, by using a cross&#8208;linking agent, a series of porous organic polymers (POPs) were designed and synthesized through Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation. As heterogeneous catalysts, these polymers have good stability, can realize the activation of oxygen under mild and green conditions, and have better performance than 9&#8208;fluorenone in the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
Oxygen activation is a critical step in heterogeneous oxidative processes, particularly in catalytic, electrolytic, and pharmaceutical applications. Among the various catalysts available for photocatalytic O2 activation, homogeneous aryl ketones are at the forefront. To avoid the degradation and deactivation of aryl ketones, 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;based porous organic polymers were designed and regulated by doping them with co&#8208;monomers. The obtained heterogeneous photocatalyst showed good performance in O2 activation, and its performance was better than that of homogeneous 9&#8208;fluorenone. The obtained heterogeneous photocatalyst showed good reusability. We believe that the presented method and findings represent an important step toward designing catalysts tailored for specific tasks.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Noncanonical &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids Containing &#947;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic decarboxylative aldol reaction was developed for the synthesis of noncanonical &#945;&#8208;amino acids containing &#947;&#8208;tertiary alcohol groups. The modularity of the electrophile enabled access to four classes of ncAAs with high efficiency as well as excellent regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) containing tertiary alcohols are valuable as precursors of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, the assembly of such ncAA scaffolds from simple material by C&#8722;C bond formation remains a challenging task due to the presence of multiple stereocenters and large steric hindrance. In this study, we present a novel solution to this problem through highly selective enzymatic decarboxylative aldol addition. This method allows for the streamlined assembly of multifunctionalized ncAAs with &#947;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available materials, such as L&#8208;aspartatic acid and isatins, vicinal diones and keto esters. The modularity of electrophiles furnished four classes of ncAAs with decent efficiency as well as excellent site and stereocontrol. Computational modeling was employed to gain detailed insight into the catalytic mechanism and to provide a rationale for the observed selectivities. The method offers a single&#8208;step approach to producing multifunctionalized ncAAs, which can be directly utilized in peptide synthesis and bioactivity assessment.

         <title>Dynamic Ultra&#8208;long Room Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled by Amorphous Molecular &#8220;Triplet Exciton Pump&#8221; for Encryption with Temporospatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal amorphous molecular host (DPOBP&#8722;Br) was designed by merging an amorphous moiety and an intersystem crossing (ISC) unit. As a &#8220;triplet exciton pump&#8221;, DPOBP&#8722;Br endows various commercial fluorescent dyes with colorful dynamic RTP in their amorphous host&#8211;guest films. Thus, amorphous coatings on even curved surfaces were successfully achieved, with 2D&#8208;time&#8208; and spatial&#8208; dependent RTP for advanced information encryption.







Abstract
Organic ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials in the amorphous state have attracted widespread attention due to their simple preparation and flexibility to adopt various forms in sensors, bioimaging, and encryption applications. However, the amorphous molecular host for the host&#8211;guest RTP systems is highly demanded but limited. Here, a universal molecular host (DPOBP&#8722;Br) has been designed by integration of an amorphous moiety of diphenylphosphine oxide (DPO) and an intersystem crossing (ISC) group of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;benzophenone (BP&#8722;Br). Various commercial fluorescence dyes were doped into the tight and transparent DPOBP&#8722;Br film, respectively, resulting in amorphous host&#8211;guest systems with ultra&#8208;long RTP colors from green to red. It was found that DPOBP&#8722;Br acted as a universal &#8220;triplet exciton pump&#8221; for promoting the generation of triplet excitons in the guest, through energy transfer processes and external heavy&#8208;atom effect based on DPOBP&#8722;Br. Interestingly, dynamic RTP was achieved by controlling residual oxygen concentration in the amorphous matrix by UV irradiation. Therefore, multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting coatings were realized even on curved surfaces, simultaneously exhibiting spatial and 2D&#8208;time dependence. This work provides a strategy to design new amorphous molecular hosts for RTP systems and demonstrates the advanced information encryption with tempo&#8208;spatial resolution based on the dynamic ultra&#8208;long RTP of an amorphous system.

This work provides a strategy to design new amorphous molecular hosts for RTP systems and demonstrates the advanced information encryption with tempo-spatial resolution based on the dynamic ultra-long RTP of an amorphous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Water Oxidation under Spatial Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial synergy has been identified as a novel approach to enhance photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation on defect complexes for the first time. This strategy synchronizes the breakage of O&#8722;H bonds in water oxidation and the formation of *COOH in CO2 reduction, effectively promoting both processes.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into fuels and oxygen is a highly promising solution for carbon&#8208;neutral recycling. Traditionally, researchers have studied CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation separately, overlooking potential synergistic interplay between these processes. This study introduces an innovative approach, spatial synergy, which encourages synergistic progress by bringing the two half&#8208;reactions into atomic proximity. To facilitate this, we developed a defective ZnIn2S4&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst (Cu&#8722;SA/D&#8722;ZIS), which demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance with CO2 reduction rates of 112.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and water oxidation rates of 52.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, exhibiting a six&#8208;fold enhancement over D&#8722;ZIS. The structural characterization results indicated that the trapping effect of vacancy associates on single&#8208;atom copper led to the formation of an unsaturated coordination structure, Cu&#8208;S3, consequently giving rise to the CuZn&#8242;VS&#8901;&#8901;VZn&#8220; defect complexes. FT&#8208;IR studies coupled with theoretical calculations reveal the spatially synergistic CO2 reduction and water oxidation on CuZn&#8242;VS&#8901;&#8901;VZn&#8221;, where the breakage of O&#8722;H in water oxidation is synchronized with the formation of *COOH, significantly lowering the energy barrier. Notably, this study introduces and, for the first time, substantiates the spatial synergy effect in CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation through a combination of experimental and theoretical analyses, providing a fresh insight in optimizing photocatalytic system.

         <title>DNAzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Specific N&#8208;Acylation of DNA Oligonucleotide Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery by in vitro selection of DNAzymes that catalyze cytidine, guanosine, and adenosine nucleobase N&#8208;acylation of DNA oligonucleotide substrates. The best new DNAzymes are rapid (complete reaction in hours), high&#8208;yielding (&gt;95&#8201;%), and site&#8208;specific for an individual nucleotide (&gt;95&#8201;% selective). Some of the new DNAzymes can also modify RNA substrates, which is promising for applications of DNAzymes to site&#8208;specific RNA labeling.







Abstract
We used in vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate the exocyclic nucleobase amines of cytidine, guanosine, and adenosine in DNA oligonucleotides. The acyl donor was the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl ester (TFPE) of a 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxyl oligonucleotide. Yields are as high as &gt;95&#8201;% in 6&#8197;h. Several of the N&#8208;acylation DNAzymes are catalytically active with RNA rather than DNA oligonucleotide substrates, and eight of nine DNAzymes for modifying C are site&#8208;specific (&gt;95&#8201;%) for one particular substrate nucleotide. These findings expand the catalytic ability of DNA to include site&#8208;specific N&#8208;acylation of oligonucleotide nucleobases. Future efforts will investigate the DNA and RNA substrate sequence generality of DNAzymes for oligonucleotide nucleobase N&#8208;acylation, toward a universal approach for site&#8208;specific oligonucleotide modification.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Multicomponent Fluoroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes: Concise Construction of Diverse Cyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component fluoroalkylative carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes to produce substituted allenes. A series of products featuring three active functional groups&#8208;allene, fluoroalkyl, and carboxyl, were generated efficiently and selectively. Furthermore, more intricate fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidinones can be constructed by simply altering the 1,3&#8208;bisnucleophilic reagent.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions, particularly those entailing four or more reagents, have presented a longstanding challenge due to the inherent complexities associated with balancing reactivity, selectivity, and compatibility. In this study, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component fluoroalkylative carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes. A series of products featuring three active functional groups&#8208;allene, fluoroalkyl, and carboxyl, were efficiently and selectively integrated in a single chemical operation. Furthermore, more intricate fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidinones can be constructed by simply altering the 1,3&#8208;bisnucleophilic reagent. This approach also provides a valuable strategy for the late&#8208;stage modification of naturally occurring molecules and concise construction of diverse cyclic compounds.

         <title>Realizing Persistent Zero Area Compressibility over a Wide Pressure Range in Cu2GeO4 by Microscopic Orthogonal&#8208;Braiding Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By a microscopic orthogonal&#8208;braiding strategy, the rare occurring zero area compressibility (ZAC) is rationally identified in Cu2GeO4, and its mechanism is attributed to an in&#8208;to&#8208;out plane charge transfer within the planar [CuO4] group under pressure.







Abstract
Zero area compressibility (ZAC) is an extremely rare mechanical response that exhibits an invariant two&#8208;dimensional size under hydrostatic pressure. All known ZAC materials are constructed from units in two dimensions as a whole. Here, we propose another strategy to obtain the ZAC by microscopically orthogonal&#8208;braiding one&#8208;dimensional zero compressibility strips. Accordingly, ZAC is identified in a copper&#8208;based compound with a planar [CuO4] unit, Cu2GeO4, that possesses an area compressibility as low as 1.58(26) TPa&#8722;1 over a wide pressure range from &#8776;0&#8197;GPa to 21.22&#8197;GPa. Based on our structural analysis, the subtle counterbalance between the shrinkage of [CuO4] and the expansion effect from the increase in the [CuO4]&#8208;[CuO4] dihedral angle attributes to the ZAC response. High&#8208;pressure Raman spectroscopy, in combination with first&#8208;principles calculations, shows that the electron transfer from in&#8208;plane bonding dx2&#8208;y2 to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nonbonding dz2 orbitals within copper atoms causes the counterintuitive extension of the [CuO4]&#8208;[CuO4] dihedral angle under pressure. Our study provides an understanding on the pressure&#8208;induced structural evolution of copper&#8208;based oxides at an electronic level and facilitates a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;dimensional anomalous mechanical materials.

Herein, we have employed a simple series of crystalline materials of the form [HAr]2[UO2X4] (Ar=aromatic N&#8208;heterocycle, X=Cl or Br) as a platform to study the influence of the outer&#8208;sphere cation HAr+ on the photophysics of uranyl emission. Through a combination of experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide explanations for the distinct energy transfer pathways in each compound.







Abstract
A series of compounds of the form [HAr]2[UO2X4] is reported here, wherein Ar is systematically varied between pyridine (1&#8208;X), quinoline (2&#8208;X), acridine (3&#8208;X), 2,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazine (4&#8208;X), quinoxaline (5&#8208;X), and phenazine (6&#8208;X), and X=Cl or Br. With greater conjugation in the organic cation, a larger quenching in uranyl luminescence is observed in the solid state. Supporting our luminescence experiments with computation, we map out the potential energy diagrams for the singlet and triplet states of both the [HAr]+ cations and [UO2Cl4]2&#8722; anion in the crystalline state, and of the assembly. The distinct energy transfer pathways in each compound are discussed.

         <title>Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Multiple&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters towards High&#8208;Performance and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design strategy has been developed to achieve both near&#8208;infrared emission and narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters. Record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of nearly 30&#8201;%, and exceptional operational stability (LT97&gt;39084&#8197;h) are realized simultaneously in the corresponding NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are highly coveted for their high efficiency and narrowband emission in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) MR&#8208;TADF emitters remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we design two new NIR MR&#8208;TADF emitters, PXZ&#8722;R&#8722;BN and BCz&#8722;R&#8722;BN, by embedding 10H&#8208;phenoxazine (PXZ) and 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (BCz) fragments to increase the electron&#8208;donating ability or extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation on the framework of para&#8208;boron fusing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Both compounds emit in the NIR region, with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 49&#8197;nm (0.13&#8197;eV) for PXZ&#8722;R&#8722;BN and 43&#8197;nm (0.11&#8197;eV) for BCz&#8722;R&#8722;BN in toluene. To sensitize the two NIR MR&#8208;TADF emitters in OLEDs, a new platinum complex, Pt&#8208;1, is designed as a sensitizer. The PXZ&#8722;R&#8722;BN&#8208;based sensitized OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of nearly 30&#8201;% with an emission band at 693&#8197;nm, and exceptional long operational stability with an LT97 (time to 97&#8201;% of the initial luminance) value of 39084&#8197;h at an initial radiance of 1000&#8197;mW&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. The BCz&#8722;R&#8722;BN&#8208;based OLEDs reach EQEmax values of 24.2&#8201;% with an emission band at 713&#8197;nm, which sets a record value for NIR OLEDs with emission bands beyond 700&#8197;nm.

         <title>Metallacyclobuta&#8208;(2,3)&#8208;diene: A Bidentate Ligand for Stream&#8208;line Synthesis of First Row Transition Metal Catalysts for Cyclic Polymerization of Phenylacetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe in this work how simple&#8208;to&#8208;prepare complexes composed of base metals such as Ti and V can be used as catalysts for the cyclic polymerization of phenylacetylene. These catalysts are prepared in one step by the treatment of the corresponding [(BDI)MCl2] with 1,3&#8208;dilithioallene [Li2(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] to form [(BDI)M{&#954;2&#8208;C,C&#8208;(Me3SiC3SiMe3)}] (BDI=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH&#8722;, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; M=Ti, V), therefore circumventing the need to utilize transition metal alkylidynes as catalyst precursors.







Abstract
Described here is a direct entry to two examples of 3d transition metal catalysts that are active for the cyclic polymerization of phenylacetylene, namely, [(BDI)M{&#954;2&#8208;C,C&#8208;(Me3SiC3SiMe3)}] (2&#8208;M) (BDI=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH&#8722;, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; M=Ti, V). Catalysts are prepared in one step by the treatment of [(BDI)MCl2] (1&#8208;M, M=Ti, V) with 1,3&#8208;dilithioallene [Li2(Me3SiC3SiMe3)]. Complexes 2&#8208;M have been spectroscopically and structurally characterized and the polymers that are catalytically formed from phenylacetylene were verified to have a cyclic topology based on a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) and intrinsic viscosity studies. Two&#8208;electron oxidation of 2&#8208;V with nitrous oxide (N2O) cleanly yields a [VV] alkylidene&#8208;alkynyl oxo complex [(BDI)V(=O){&#954;1&#8208;C&#8208;(=C(SiMe3)CC(SiMe3))}] (3), which lends support for how this scaffold in 2&#8208;M might be operating in the polymerization of the terminal alkyne. This work demonstrates how alkylidynes can be circumvented using 1,3&#8208;dianionic allene as a segue into M&#8722;C multiple bonds.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Magnetism&#8208;Conversion Nanoprobes for Activatable Ultra&#8208;High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a focal point of interest in the field of cancer diagnosis. Despite the ability of current paramagnetic or superparamagnetic smart MRI contrast agents to selectively enhance tumor signals in low&#8208;field MRI, their effectiveness at UHF remains inadequate due to inherent magnetism. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) composed of 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid ligand&#8208;coated silver&#8208;gadolinium bimetallic nanoparticles. The MCNP exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent magnetism conversion from ferromagnetism to diamagnetism, facilitating tunable nanomagnetism for pH&#8208;activatable UHF MRI. Under neutral pH, the thiolate (&#8208;S&#8208;) ligands lead to short &#964;'m and increased magnetization of the MCNPs. Conversely, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the thiolate ligands are protonated and transform into thiol (&#8208;SH) ligands, resulting in prolonged &#964;'m and decreased magnetization of the MCNP, thereby enhancing longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values at UHF MRI. Notably, under a 9 T MRI field, the pH&#8208;sensitive changes in Ag&#8208;S binding affinity of the MCNP lead to a remarkable (&gt;10&#8208;fold) r1 increase in an acidic medium (pH 5.0). In vivo studies demonstrate the capability of MCNPs to amplify MRI signal of hepatic tumors, suggesting their potential as a next&#8208;generation UHF&#8208;tailored smart MRI contrast agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered W18O49&#8208;x Nanobrush with a Suitable Band Structure for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapid development of external minimally invasive or noninvasive therapeutic modalities, ultrasound&#8208;based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new alternative for treating deep tumors. However, inadequate sonosensitizer efficiency and poor biosecurity limit clinical applications. In this study, we prepared an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8208;x nanobrush with a 2.79 eV bandgap for highly efficient SDT using a simple solvothermal method. The suitable band structures of the W18O49&#8208;x nanobrush endows it with the potential to simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anions (&#8226;O2&#8722;), and hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) under ultrasound irradiation. Additionally, abundant oxygen vacancies that serve as further charge traps that inhibit electron&#8211;hole recombination are incidentally introduced through one&#8208;step thermal reduction. Collectively, the in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo results demonstrate that the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8208;x nanobrush delivers highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT in a very biosafe manner. Overall, this study provides a new avenue for discovering and designing inorganic nanosonosensitizers with enhanced therapeutic efficiencies for use in SDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Behaviors of Charged Star Block Copolymers at Fluids Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phase behaviors of block copolymers (BCPs) at the water&#8208;oil interface are influenced by the segmental interaction parameter (&#967;) and chain architecture. We synthesized a series of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) having polystyrene (PS) as core and poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona. The interaction parameters of block&#8208;block (&#967;PS&#8208;P2VP) and block&#8208;solvent (&#967;P2VP&#8208;solvent) were varied by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution. Lowering pH increased the fraction of quaternized&#8208;P2VP (Q&#8208;P2VP) with enhanced hydrophilicity. By transferring the equilibrated interfacial assemblies, morphologies ranging from bicontinuous films at pH of 7 and 3.1 to nanoporous and nanotubular structure at pH of 0.65 were observed. The nanoporous films formed hexagonally packed pores in s&#8208;BCP matrix, while nanotubes comprised Q&#8208;P2VP as corona and PS as core. Control over pore size, d&#8208;spacing between pores, and nanotube diameters was achieved by varying polymer concentration, molecular weight, volume fraction and arm number of s&#8208;BCPs. Large&#8208;scale nanoporous films were obtained by freeze&#8208;drying emulsions. Remarkably, the morphologies of linear BCPs were inverted, forming hexagonal&#8208;packed rigid spherical micelles with Q&#8208;P2VP as core and PS as corona in multilayer. This work provides insights of phase behaviors of BCP at fluids interface and offer a facile approach to prepare nanoporous film&#160;with well&#8208;controlled pore structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;18 Labeling Reveals a Mixed Fe&#8208;O Mechanism in the Last Step of Cytochrome P450 51 Sterol 14&#945;&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 14&#945;&#8208;demethylation step is critical in eukaryotic sterol biosynthesis, catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) Family 51 enzymes, e.g. with lanosterol in mammals. This conserved 3&#8208;step reaction terminates in a C&#8208;C cleavage step that generates formic acid, the nature of which has been controversial. Proposed mechanisms involve roles of P450 Compound 0 (ferric peroxide anion, FeO2&#175;) or Compound I (perferryl oxygen, FeO3+) reacting with either the aldehyde or its hydrate, respectively. Analysis of&#160;18O incorporation into formic acid from&#160;18O2&#160;provides a means of distinguishing the two mechanisms. Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88%&#160;18O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO2&#175; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen 3.5 &#197; away from the heme iron. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H218O yielded primarily one&#160;18O atom but 14% of the formic acid product with two&#160;18O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8208;MS evidence for a Compound 0&#8208;derived Baeyer&#8208;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;&#8208;formyl ester) was also found.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Efficient Single Metal Atom Biocatalysts at the Atomic Structure Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various nanomaterials as biocatalysts could be custom&#8208;designed and modified to precisely match the specific microenvironment of diseases, showing a promise in achieving effective therapy outcome. Compared to conventional biocatalysts, single metal atom catalysts (SMACs) with the maximized atom utilization through well&#8208;defined structures offer enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity and enable the exploration of catalytic activity and the examination of structure&#8208;mechanism interactions. There is still a gap in the comprehensive overview encompassing the interplay among the structure, catalytic mechanism, and biomedical applications of SMACs. Therefore, it is crucial to deeply investigate the role of SMACs in biocatalysis from the atomic structure level and to elucidate their potential mechanisms in biocatalytic processes. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize catalysis regulation methods of SMACs at the atomic structure level, focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and discuss biocatalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodinated Electron Acceptor with Significantly Extended Exciton Diffusion Length for Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodination has unlocked new potentials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A newly designed and synthesized iodinated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, showcases exceptional excitation delocalization property with the exciton diffusion length increased to 80 nm. The enhanced electron delocalization property is attributed to the larger atomic radius and electron orbit of the iodine atom, which facilitates the formation of intra&#8208;moiety excitations in the acceptor phase. This effectively circumvents the charge transfer state&#8208;related recombination mechanisms, leading to a substantial reduction in non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). As a result, OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:BO&#8208;4I achieves an impressive efficiency of 18.9% with a notable &#916;Enr of 0.189 eV, markedly surpassing their fluorinated counterparts. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of iodination in reducing energy loss, thereby affirming its potential as a key strategy in the development of advanced next&#8208;generation OPV cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Approach for Z&#8208;Vinyl Fluorides by Hydrofluorination of Alkynes bearing SF4 and SF5 Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of vinyl fluorides plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Herein, we present a direct and stereoselective hydrofluorination method for the synthesis of Z isomers of vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups. Our strategy employed tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as a fluorine source. It demonstrates high compatibility with aryls, biaryls, heteroaryls, and tert&#8208;alkyl groups, allowing facile incorporation of SF5 and SF4 groups across the triple bond without any transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach avoids the potential decomposition of the SF5 or SF4 units via coordination with transition metals or acidic protic sources. Remarkably, this transformation proceeded at room temperature without any additional additives, providing the Z isomer of vinyl fluorides in excellent yield and high selectivity. The presence of a water molecule as a hydrate in TBAF is essential for efficient conversion. This methodology opens new avenues for the synthesis of enchanted SF5&#8208; and SF4&#8208;containing fluorinated vinylic scaffolds, thereby providing advanced opportunities for novel drug discovery and fluorinated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Bioorthogonal Tumor&#8208;Membrane Reactor for In Situ Selective and Sustained Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;specific activation of bioorthogonal prodrugs has provided great opportunities for reducing the severe side effects of chemotherapy. However, the precise control of activation location, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency in vivo remain great challenges. Here, we propose the construction of tumor cell membrane reactors in vivo to solve the above problems. Specifically, tumor&#8208;targeted liposomes with efficient membrane fusion capabilities are generated to install the bioorthogonal trigger, the amphiphilic tetrazine derivative, on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as many living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that in situ activates an externally delivered bioorthogonal prodrug, for example intratumorally injected transcyclooctene&#8208;caged doxorubicin. In contrast to the rapid elimination of cargo that is encapsulated and delivered by liposomes, these reactors permit stable retention of bioorthogonal triggers in tumor for 96 h after a single dose of liposomes via intravenous injection, allowing sustained generation of doxorubicin. Interestingly, an additional supplement of liposomes will compensate for the trigger consumed by the reaction and significantly improve the efficiency of the local reaction. This strategy provides a solution to the efficacy versus safety dilemma of tumor chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Carbonylation towards Chiral Isoindolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8208;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide, an essential and easily available C1 feedstock, remains challenging. Here, we disclosed an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation catalyzed by inexpensive and readily available cobalt(II) salt. The reactions proceed efficiently through desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, affording a broad range of chiral isoindolinones in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 92% yield and 99% ee). The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of biological active compounds, such as (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. The resulting chiral isoindolinones also serve as chiral ligands in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation with alkynes to construct phosphorus stereocenter.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Multifunctional Biomaterials via Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein self&#8208;assembly is a fundamental biological process where proteins spontaneously organize into complex and functional structures without external direction. This process is crucial for the formation of various biological functionalities. However, when protein self&#8208;assembly fails, it can trigger the development of multiple disorders, thus making understanding this phenomenon extremely important. Up until recently, protein self&#8208;assembly has been solely linked either to biological function or malfunction; however, in the past decade or two it has also been found to hold promising potential as an alternative route for fabricating materials for biomedical applications. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the key aspects of protein self&#8208;assembly: how the protein structure and self&#8208;assembly conditions (chemical environments, kinetics, and the physicochemical characteristics of protein complexes) can be utilized to design biomaterials. This minireview focuses on the basic concepts of forming supramolecular structures, and the existing routes for modifications. We then compare the applicability of different approaches, including compartmentalization and self&#8208;assembly monitoring. Finally, based on the cutting&#8208;edge progress made during the last years, we summarize the current knowledge about tailoring a final function by introducing changes in self&#8208;assembly and link it to biomaterials&#8217; performance.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled Reversible Folding of Synthetic Copolymers via Formation of &#946;&#8208;Sheet Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence&#8208;defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure&#8208; driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence&#8208;defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid peptide&#8208;DMA copolymers via radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization (rROP) of peptide containing macrocycles. The resulting synthetic polymers contain sequence&#8208;defined regions of &#946;&#8208;sheet encoding amino acid sequences. Exploiting the pH responsiveness of the embedded sequences, protonation or deprotonation in water induces self&#8208;assembly of the peptide strands at an intramacromolecular level, driving polymer chain folding via formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures. We demonstrate that the folding behavior is sequence dependent and reversible.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Renewable electricities driven&#160;electrocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction&#160;reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8208;N chemicals from CO2&#160;and nitrogen species. However,&#160;it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2&#160;and NO3&#8208;/NO2&#8208;&#160;to generate aldoxime&#160;an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling process.&#160;Herein, we report&#160;the successful&#160;electrochemical conversion of CO2&#160;and NO2&#8208;&#160;to acetamide for&#160;the first time&#160;over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce&#160;acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2&#160;and wastewater.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting &#960; and Chalcogen Interactions for the &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Indoles through Glycal Conformational Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing productive chalcogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, a phosphonoselenide catalyst was used for stereoselective C,N&#8208;glycosylation. This unique activation manifold distorts the glycal conformation and enables both the C3 and N1 positions of indole to be appended directly to the anomeric position of glycals, thus providing access to an array of biologically important &#946;&#8208;indolyl glycosides.







Abstract
Harnessing unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) is emerging as a formidable synthetic approach in difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access glycosidic chemical space. C&#8208;Glycosylation, in particular, has gained a flurry of recent attention. However, most reported methods are restricted to the relatively facile access to &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides. Herein, we disclose a &#946;&#8208;stereoselective glycosylation of indoles by employing a phosphonoselenide catalyst. The robustness of this protocol is exemplified by its amenability for reaction at both the indolyl C&#8208; and N&#8208; reactivity sites. In contrast to previous reports, in which the chalcogens were solely involved in Lewis acidic activation, our mechanistic investigation unraveled that the often neglected flanking aromatic substituents of phosphonoselenides can substantially contribute to catalysis by engaging in &#960;&#8208;interactions. Computations and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the chalcogenic and aromatic components of the catalyst can be collectively exploited to foster conformational distortion of the glycal away from the usual half&#8208;chair to the boat conformation, which liberates the convex &#946;&#8208;face for nucleophilic attack.

         <title>An Intelligent DNA Nanoreactor for Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Read In Vivo Tumor Imaging and Precise Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) following an &#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm was constructed. iDNR exhibits superior stability, improved binding affinity, and superior targeting/retention capability. It addresses previous limitations such as always &#8220;ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, off&#8208;target effects, and high cost. Therefore, it enables the development of similar iDNRs for various biomedical applications.







Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;based in vivo tumor imaging and therapy have attracted extensive attention; however, they suffer from the unintelligent &#8220;always ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, substantial off&#8208;target effects, and high cost. Therefore, achieving in vivo easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging and precise therapy in a multi&#8208;parameter responsive and intelligent manner remains challenging. Herein, an intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) was constructed following the &#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm to address these issues. iDNR&#8208;mediated in situ deposition of photothermal substance polydopamine (PDA) can only be satisfied in tumor tissues with abundant membrane protein biomarkers &#8220;AND&#8221; hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Therefore, intelligent temperature&#8208;based in vivo easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging is realized without expensive instrumentation, and its diagnostic performance matches with that of flow cytometry, and photoacoustic imaging. Moreover, precise photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors could be achieved via intelligent heating of tumor tissues. The precise PTT of primary tumors in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy suppresses the growth of distant tumors and inhibits tumor recurrence. Therefore, highly programmable iDNR is a powerful tool for intelligent biomedical applications.

         <title>Rare Earth Evoked Subsurface Oxygen Species in Platinum Alloy Catalysts Enable Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing rare earth bonded subsurface oxygen atoms into Pt3Ni via a high temperature entropy&#8208;driven process, we have addressed the Pt degradation issue via delaying the place exchange between adsorbed oxygen species and surface Pt atoms. The Gd&#8722;O&#8722;Pt3Ni catalyst has achieved high mass activity and high durability simultaneously under low platinum group metal (PGM) loading in PEMFCs.







Abstract
Alleviating the degradation issue of Pt based alloy catalysts, thereby simultaneously achieving high mass activity and high durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), is highly challenging. Herein, we provide a new paradigm to address this issue via delaying the place exchange between adsorbed oxygen species and surface Pt atoms, thereby inhibiting Pt dissolution, through introducing rare earth bonded subsurface oxygen atoms. We have succeeded in introducing Gd&#8722;O dipoles into Pt3Ni via a high temperature entropy&#8208;driven process, with direct spectral evidence attained from both soft and hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The higher rated power of 0.93&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and superior current density of 562.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;V than DOE target for heavy&#8208;duty vehicles in H2&#8208;air mode suggest the great potential of Gd&#8722;O&#8722;Pt3Ni towards practical application in heavy&#8208;duty transportation. Moreover, the mass activity retention (1.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) after 40&#8197;k cycles accelerated durability tests is even 2.4&#8197;times of the initial mass activity goal for DOE 2025 (0.44&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1), due to the weakened Pt&#8722;Oads bond interaction and the delayed place exchange process, via repulsive forces between surface O atoms and those in the sublayer. This work addresses the critical roadblocks to the widespread adoption of PEMFCs.

         <title>Topological Single&#8208;stranded DNA Encoding and Programmable Assembly of Molecular Nanostructures for NIR&#8208;II Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial base&#8208;directed topological DNA&#8208;encoding strategy is reported as a versatile platform for engineering NIR&#8208;II nanomedicine with programmable assembly and precise control over composition and surface valence. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies were performed to engineer Ag2S&#8208;DNA QDs and CuS&#8208;DNA nanodots, demonstrating strong emission or absorption in the NIR&#8208;II window favorable for applications in bioimaging and deep&#8208;penetration tumor therapy.







Abstract
Molecular nanotechnology promises to offer privileged access to developing NIR&#8208;II materials with precise structural and functional manipulation for transformable theranostic applications. However, the lack of an affordable, yet general, method makes this goal currently inaccessible. By virtue of the intriguing nucleic acid chemistry, here we present an artificial base&#8208;directed topological single&#8208;strand DNA encoding design that enables one&#8208;step synthesis of valence&#8208;controlled NIR&#8208;II molecular nanostructures and spatial assembly of these nanostructures to modulate their behaviors in living systems. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, we construct ultrasmall Ag2S quantum dots and pH&#8208;responsive, size&#8208;tunable CuS assemblies for in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and deep tumor photothermal therapy. This work paves a new way for creating functionally diversified architectures and broadens the scope of DNA&#8208;encoded material engineering.

         <title>Selective Hemin Binding by a Non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex Aptamer with Higher Affinity and Better Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using capture&#8208;SELEX, a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer for selective hemin binding was obtained, and it did not bind to closely related protoporphyrin IX. The new aptamer doubled heat release compared to a classical G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer, indicating a fundamentally different way of hemin binding.







Abstract
Previous aptamers for porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were all guanine&#8208;rich sequences that can fold in G&#8208;quadruplex structures. Due to stacking&#8208;based binding, these aptamers can hardly tell different porphyrins apart, and they can also bind other planar molecules, hindering their practical applications. In this work, we used the capture selection method to obtain aptamers for hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The hemin aptamer (Hem1) features two highly conserved repeating binding loops, and it cannot form a G&#8208;quadruplex, which was supported by its Mg2+&#8208;dependent but K+&#8208;independent hemin binding and CD spectroscopy. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed much higher enthalpy change for the new aptamer, and the best aptamer showed a Kd of 43&#8197;nM hemin. Hem1 can also enhance the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of hemin. This work demonstrates that aptamers have alternative ways to bind porphyrins allowing selective recognition of different porphyrins.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Fully&#8208;Substituted and Configuration&#8208;Defined Alkyl Vinyl Ethers Enabled by Dual&#8208;Functional Copper&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) using simple chemical feedstocks. The distinctive approach involves the chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of the CF2 unit in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with O&#8208;H and C&#8208;H nucleophiles in a specific order. The resulting highly functionalized cyclopropanyl ethers then undergo a stereoselective ring&#8208;opening process to produce fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined AVEs. These AVEs are rarely accessible through conventional methods and are easily transformable. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the success of this method relies on the use of dual&#8208;functional copper catalysis, which is involved in both the functionalization of the CF2 unit and the subsequent ring&#8208;opening process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;N2 Batteries with Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation and Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;N2 batteries have received widespread attention for their potential to integrate N2 fixation, energy storage, and conversion. However, because of the low activity and poor stability of cathode catalysts, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;N2 batteries is suboptimal, and their electrochemical reversibility has rarely been proven. In this study, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system was established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. The Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities, and the photogenerated electrons and hot electrons are remarkably beneficial for accelerating the discharge and charge reaction kinetics. These advantages enable the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery to achieve a low overpotential of 1.32 V, which is the lowest overpotential reported to date, as well as superior rate capability and prolonged cycle stability (~500 h). Remarkably, a combination of theoretical and experimental results demonstrates the high reversibility of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery. The proposed novel strategy for developing efficient cathode catalysts and fabricating photo&#8208;assisted battery systems breaks through the overpotential bottleneck of Li&#8208;N2 batteries, providing important insights into the mechanism underlying N2 fixation and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8211;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68% to 76%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8226;&#8722; and &#8226;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Intensified Continuous Flow Process for the Scalable Production of Bio&#8208;Based Glycerol Carbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A subtle combination of fundamental and applied organic chemistry toward process intensification is demonstrated for the large&#8208;scale production of bio&#8208;based glycerol carbonate under flow conditions. The direct carbonation of bio&#8208;based glycidol with CO2 is successfully carried out under intensified flow conditions, with Barton&#8217;s base as a potent homogeneous organocatalyst. Process metrics for the CO2 coupling step (for the upstream production, output: 3.6 kg day&#8208;1, Space Time Yield (STY): 2.7 kg h&#8208;1 L&#8208;1, Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor): 4.7) outclass previous reports. High conversion and selectivity are achieved in less than 30 s of residence time at pilot scale with a stoichiometric amount of CO2. Supporting DFT computations reveal the unique features of the mechanism in presence of Br&#248;nsted bases.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0 nm &#215; 6.0 nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8211; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate glioma cell apoptosis pathway with a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66 &#956;M). As the first brain&#8208;targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8211;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5%Cu/m-ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5%Cu/t-ZrO2) predominantly produces p-xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m-ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m-ZrO2 compared to t-ZrO2. This weak acidity of m-ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption.

         <title>Sonogenetics for Monitoring and Modulating Biomolecular Function by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasound technology, synergistically harnessed with genetic engineering and chemistry concepts, has started to open the gateway to the remarkable realm of sonogenetics &#8211; a pioneering paradigm for remotely orchestrating cellular functions at the molecular level. This fusion not only enables precisely targeted imaging and therapeutic interventions, but also advances our comprehension of mechanobiology to unparalleled depths. Sonogenetic tools harness mechanical force within small tissue volumes while preserving the integrity of the surrounding physiological environment, reaching depths of up to tens of centimeters with high spatiotemporal precision. These capabilities circumvent the inherent physical limitations of alternative in vivo control methods such as optogenetics and magnetogenetics. In this review, we first discuss mechanosensitive ion channels, the most commonly utilized sonogenetic mediators, in both mammalian and non&#8208;mammalian systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic approaches that leverage thermal or mechanical features of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, we explore strategies centered around the design of mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of ultrasound imaging of biomolecular function, encompassing the utilization of gas vesicles and acoustic reporter genes. Finally, we shed light on limitations and challenges of sonogenetics and present a perspective on the future of this promising technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosing Support&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Effect on Ambient Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation over Nickel/Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The size of support in heterogeneous catalysts can strongly affect the catalytic property but is rarely explored in light&#8208;driven catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the size of TiO2 support governs the selectivity in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation by tuning the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI). Small&#8208;size TiO2 loading nickel (Ni/TiO2&#8208;25) with enhanced MSI promotes photo&#8208;induced electrons of TiO2 migrating to Ni nanoparticles, thus favoring the H2 cleavage and accelerating the CH4 formation (227.7 mmol g&#8201;&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under xenon light&#8208;induced temperature of 360&#8201;&#176;C. Conversely, Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 with large TiO2 prefers yielding CO (94.2 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) due to weak MSI, inefficient charge separation, and inadequate supply of activated hydrogen. Under ambient solar irradiation, Ni/TiO2&#8208;25 achieves the optimized CH4 rate (63.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) with selectivity of 99.8%, while Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 exhibits the CO selectivity of 90.0 % with rate of 30.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. This work offers a novel approach to tailoring light&#8208;driven catalytic properties by support size effect.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8208;H borylation, accessing the fused BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Distortion in the Wadsley&#8208;Roth Niobium Molybdenum Oxide Phase Triggering Extraordinarily Stable Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wadsley&#8208;Roth niobium oxide phases have attracted extensive research interest recently as promising battery anodes. We have synthesized the niobium&#8208;molybdenum oxide shear phase (Nb, Mo)13O33 with superior electrochemical Li&#8208;ion storage performance, including an ultralong cycling lifespan of at least 15000 cycles. During electrochemical cycling, a reversible single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution reaction with lithiated intermediate solid solutions is demonstrated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, with the valence and short&#8208;range structural changes of the electrode probed by in situ Nb and Mo K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. This work reveals that the superior stability of niobium molybdenum oxides is underpinned by changes in octahedral distortion during electrochemical reactions, and we report an in&#8208;depth understanding of how this stabilizes the oxide structure during cycling with implications for future long&#8208;life battery material design.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylogous Urea &#8208; Urethane Vitrimers: Accelerating and Inhibiting Network Dynamics through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylogous urethane (VUO) based polymer networks are widely used as catalyst&#8208;free vitrimers that show rapid covalent bond exchange at elevated temperatures. In solution, vinylogous ureas (VUN) undergo much faster bond exchange than VUO and are highly dynamic at room temperature. However, this difference in reactivity is not observed in their respective dynamic polymer networks, as VUO and VUN vitrimers prepared herein with very similar macromolecular architectures show comparable stress relaxation and creep behavior. However, by using mixtures of VUO and VUN linkages within the same network, the dynamic reactions can be accelerated by an order of magnitude. The results can be rationalized by the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is absent in VUO vitrimers, but is very pronounced for vinylogous urea moieties. At low concentrations of VUN, these hydrogen bonds act as catalysts for covalent bond exchange, while at high concentration, they provide a pervasive vinylogous urea &#8208; urethane (VU) network of strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, giving rise to phase separation and inhibiting polymer chain dynamics. This offers a straightforward design principle for dynamic polymer materials, showing at the same time the possible additive and synergistic effects of supramolecular and dynamic covalent polymer networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#160;Engineering Enabling High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Rubost Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Hard Carbon in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP&#8208;HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (~7.4 nm) SEI was constructed on the DP&#8208;HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8%), the as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high ICE of &gt;96.3% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8211;1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP&#8208;HC full&#8208;cell with a 98.7% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP&#8208;HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Bismuth&#8208;halide Perovskite in Mesochannels of Silica Nanomembranes for Exceptional Photocatalytic Abatement of Air Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas&#8208;solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica&#160;thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70 nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO&#160;conversion efficiency of 98.2% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106 mL g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14 h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15~90%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas-solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica&#160;thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one-dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70 nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record-breaking NO&#160;conversion efficiency of 98.2% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106 mL g-1 h-1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14 h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15~90%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA-15).

         <title>Microbubble Biointerfacing by Regulation of the Platelet Membrane Surfactant Activity at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface for Acute Thrombosis Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biointerfacing nanomaterials with cell membranes has been successful in the functionalization of nanoparticles or nanovesicles, but microbubble functionalization remains challenging due to the unique conformation of the lipid monolayer structure at the gas&#8208;liquid interface that provides insufficient surfactant activity. Here, we describe a strategy to rationally regulate the surfactant activity of platelet membrane vesicles by adjusting the ratio of proteins to lipids through fusion with synthetic phospholipids (i.e., liposomes). A &#8220;platesome&#8221; with the optimized protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio can be assembled at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in the same manner as pulmonary surfactants to stabilize a microsized gas bubble. Platesome microbubbles (PMBs) inherited 61.4% of the platelet membrane vesicle proteins and maintained the active conformation of integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 without the talin&#8208;1 for fibrin binding. We demonstrated that the PMBs had good stability, long circulation, and superior functionality both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by molecular ultrasound imaging, the PMBs provide up to 11.8 dB of ultrasound signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement for discriminating between acute and chronic thrombi. This surface tension regulating strategy may provide a paradigm for biointerfacing microbubbles with cell membranes, offering a potential new approach for the construction of molecular ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of different diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicoselective Synthesis of Indolohelicenoids via Organocatalytic Central&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Chirality Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a helicoselective and convergent construction of indolohelicenoids with excellent efficiency and stereocontrol. This reaction proceeds through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition and eliminative aromatization sequence, which can be finely controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral phosphoric acid cooperatively serves as both a bifunctional and Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, enabling a one&#8208;pot central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion. Additionally, the optical properties of the synthesized indolohelicenoids were characterized to explore their potential applications in organic photoelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Polar Perovskites for Highly Sensitive&#160;Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray&#160;Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs)  have achieved tremendous success in direct X&#8208;ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport. However, owing to the centrosymmetry of classic 3D structures, these reported X&#8208;ray detectors mostly require external electrical fields to run, resulting in bulky overall circuitry, high energy consumption, and operational instability. Herein, we first report the unprecedented radiation photovoltage in 3D OIHP for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, the 3D polar OIHP MhyPbBr3 (1, Mhy = methylhydrazine) shows an intrinsic radiation photovoltage (0.47 V) and large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (1.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, these excellent physical characteristics endow 1 with sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection performance, showing a considerable sensitivity of 220 &#956;C Gy&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, which surpasses those of most self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detectors. This work first explores highly sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D polar OIHPs, shedding light on future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating the Electrochemical Oxidation of ZnS through Iodide Catalysis for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur (Zn&#8208;S) batteries show great potential for unlocking high energy and safety aqueous batteries. Yet, the sluggish kinetic and poor redox reversibility of the sulfur conversion reaction in aqueous solution challenge the development of Zn&#8208;S batteries. Here, we fabricate a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;S battery using highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 as an effective catalyst. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between I&#8722; and the ZnS nanoparticles (discharge product) leads to the atomic rearrangement of ZnS, weakening the Zn&#8208;S bonding, and thus facilitating the electrochemical oxidation reaction of ZnS to S. The aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery exhibited a high energy density of 742 Wh kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 at the power density of 210.8 W kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn&#8208;S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Patient&#8208;derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids: A Platform for Chemotherapy Evaluation in the Context of T&#8208;cell Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV&#160;compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these,&#160;Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent,&#160;demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Li Deposition by Regulating Structural Connectivity of Electrochemical Li Reservoir in Li&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology&#8208;performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well&#8208;distributed morphology of the in&#8208;situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.</dc:description>

The structural connection and resultant well-distributed morphology of the in-situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode-free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bidirectional Regulation of Intracellular Enzyme Activity Using Light&#8208;Driven Nano&#8208;Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical regulation provides precise control over enzyme activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. A promising approach involves anchoring "photoswitches" at enzyme active sites to modulate substrate recognition. However, current methods often require genetic mutations and irreversible enzyme modifications for the site&#8208;specific anchoring of "photoswitches", potentially compromising the enzyme activities. Herein, we present a pioneering reversible nano&#8208;inhibitor based on molecular imprinting technique for bidirectional regulation of intracellular enzyme activity. The nano&#8208;inhibitor employs a molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticle as its body and azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors ("photoswitches") as the arms. By using a target enzyme as the molecular template, the nano&#8208;inhibitor acquires oriented binding sites on its surface, resulting in a high affinity for the target enzyme and non&#8208;covalently firm anchoring of the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitor to the enzyme active site. Harnessing the reversible isomerization of azobenzene units upon exposure to ultraviolet and visible light, the nano&#8208;inhibitor achieves bidirectional enzyme activity regulation by precisely docking and undocking inhibitor at the active site. Notably, this innovative approach enables the facile in situ regulation of intracellular endogenous enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Our results represent a practical and versatile tool for precise enzyme activity regulation in complex intracellular environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Protein Engineering of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase for Light&#8208;Driven Kinetic Resolution of Sec&#8208;Alcohol Oxalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme into stereocomplementary variants for achieving optically pure molecules with tailor&#8208;made (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) using the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both enantiomeric excess up to 99%). These variants were used for the CvFAP&#8208;catalyzed light&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral sec&#8208;alcohols or amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of sec&#8208;alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Harmonizing Enzyme&#8208;like Cofactors to Boost Nanozyme&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering isolated metal sites resembling the primary coordination sphere of metallocofactors enables atomically dispersed materials as promising nanozymes. However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme&#8208;like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like catalysis. Among them, the linker&#8208;coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates. The synergy of three nanocofactors results in a 4.29&#8208;fold enhancement compared with the single effort of isolated metal site&#8208;based nanocofactor, holding promise in immunoassay for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos. This finding opens a new way for designing high&#8208;performance nanozymes by harmonizing various nanocofactors at the atomic and molecular scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;initiated living self&#8208;assembly of polythiophene&#8208;based conjugated block copolymer into erect micellar brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured conjugated polymers are of widespread interest due to their broad applications in organic optoelectronic devices, biomedical sensors and other fields. However, the alignment of conjugated nanostructures perpendicular to&#160;surfaces remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to directly self&#8208;assemble a poly(3&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophene), P3EHT&#8208;based block copolymer into densely aligned micellar brushes through surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The presence of an ethyl pendant on the side group intrinsically moderates the crystallization rate of the polythiophene main chains, and hence favors the controlled living growth of long conjugated fibers and the subsequent fabrication of conjugated micellar brushes. The corona of the micellar brush can be further decorated with platinum nanoparticles by in situ reduction, which enables the formation of erect nanoarrays with heights up to 2700 nm in the dried state. This also renders the micellar brush catalytically active toward hydrogen evolution reaction, which shows a low overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Notably, the P3EHT&#8208;based micellar brush can simultaneously grow with polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PFS&#8208;based micellar brush on the same surface without&#160;significant interference between the two systems. Thus, these two micellar brushes can be patterned through site&#8208;selective immobilization of two types of seeds followed by independent living self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Glutathione Depletion and STING Activation to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Maturation and Cancer Vaccine Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation are key factors for successful vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. This study developed manganese&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (Mn&#8208;LDH) nanoparticles as a self&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine carrier that not only promoted DC maturation through synergistically depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) and activating STING signaling pathway, but also facilitated the delivery of model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into lymph nodes and subsequent antigen presentation in DCs. Significant therapeutic&#8208;prophylactic efficacy of the OVA&#8208;loaded Mn&#8208;LDH (OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH) nanovaccine was determined by the tumor growth inhibition in the mice bearing B16&#8208;OVA tumor. Our results showed that the OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH nanoparticles could be a potent delivery system for cancer vaccine development without the need of adjuvant. Therefore, the combination of GSH exhaustion and STING pathway activation might be an advisable approach for promoting DC maturation and antigen presentation, finally improving cancer vaccine efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of a Hydrophobic Protrusion on Nanoparticles to Improve the Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Ability and Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction to achieve easy and fast membrane anchoring and cellular internalization is of great importance in a variety of biomedical applications. Here we report a simple and versatile strategy to maneuver the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction by creating a tunable hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles through swelling&#8208;induced symmetry breaking. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, leading the particles to docking to the membrane, followed by drawing the whole particles into the cell. The efficiencies of both membrane anchoring and cellular internalization can be promoted by optimizing the size of the protrusion. In vitro, the Janus particles can quickly anchor to the cell membrane in 1 h and be internalized within 24 h, regardless of the types of cells involved. In vivo, the Janus particles can effectively anchor to the brain and skin tissues to provide a high retention in these tissues after intracerebroventricular, intrahippocampal, or subcutaneous injection. This strategy involving the creation of a hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles to tune the cell&#8208;membrane interaction holds great potential in nanoparticle&#8208;based biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 Signaling and Inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; Checkpoint with a Dual siRNA&#8208;Assembled Nanoadjuvant for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the anti&#8208;tumor immunity as they are responsible for capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells. However, their activation is often limited by the absence of adjuvants and the suppressive effects of immune checkpoints, such as CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945;. Herein, we present a nanoadjuvant that is self&#8208;assembled from long RNA building blocks generated through rolling circle transcription (RCT) reaction and further modified with cationic liposomes. Owing to the high load of densely packed RNA, this nanoadjuvant could robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling in APCs, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti&#8208;tumor M1&#8208;like phenotype. In addition, with a well&#8208;designed template, the generated long RNA from RCT reaction includes two kinds of siRNA targeting both CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs. This dual gene silencing results in efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint. Collectively, the robust activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling and efficient inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint enhance the phagocytic activity of APCs, which in turn promotes the cross&#8208;priming of effector T cells and the activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. This study therefore provides a simple and robust RNA nanoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>L&#8208;Glycosidase&#8208;Cleavable Natural Glycans Facilitate the Chemical Synthesis of Correctly Folded Disulfide&#8208;Bonded D&#8208;Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;peptide ligands can be screened for therapeutic potency and enzymatic stability using synthetic mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins), but efficient acquisition of these D&#8208;proteins can be hampered by the need to accomplish their in vitro folding, which often requires the formation of correctly linked disulfide bonds. Here, we report the finding that temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto selected D&#8208;serine or D&#8208;threonine residues of the synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and that the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins to afford the desired chirally inverted D&#8208;protein targets using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase. This approach enabled the efficient chemical syntheses of several important but difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold D&#8208;proteins incorporating disulfide bonds including the mirror&#8208;image tumor necrosis factor alpha (D&#8208;TNF&#945;) homotrimer and the mirror&#8208;image receptor&#8208;binding domain of the Omicron spike protein (D&#8208;RBD). Our work establishes the use of O&#8208;GlcNAc to facilitate D&#8208;protein synthesis and folding and proves that D&#8208;proteins bearing O&#8208;GlcNAc can be good substrates for naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Control and Singlet Energy Transfer Enabled by Trimethylamine Modified Boron Dipyrromethene for Stable CsPbBr3 Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phase distribution and organic spacer cations play pivotal roles in determining the emission performance and stability of perovskite quantum wells (QWs). Here, we propose a universal molecular regulation strategy to tailor phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 QWs. The capability of sterically hindered ligands with formidable surface binding groups is underscored in directing CsPbBr3 growth and refining phase distribution. With trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) ligand as a representative, the BDP&#8208;TMA driven can precisely control phase distribution and passivate defects of CsPbBr3. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA acts as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity in obtained BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3, facilitating efficient singlet energy transfer and tailoring the luminescence to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. The BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 demonstrates significant phase stability under water exposure, light irradiation, and moderate temperature. Interestingly, BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control at elevated temperatures, which can be achieved feasible for advanced information encryption. This discovery paves the way for the exploration of perovskite QWs in applications like temperature sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other advanced optical smart technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Multiple Photosensitizer Modules into One Supramolecular System for Synergetic Enhancement of Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an emerging cancer treatment requires the development of highly desirable photosensitizers (PSs) with integrated functional groups to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) would provide an alternative approach for combining multiple PSs synergistically. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful strategy of combining conventional chromophores (tetraphenylethylene, porphyrin, or Zn&#8208;porphyrin) with pyridinium salts PSs together via condensation reactions, followed by CDSA to construct a series of novel metallo&#8208;supramolecular&#160;PSs (S1&#8211;S3). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is dramatically enhanced via the direct combination of two different PSs, and further reinforced in the cases of the subsequent ensembles. Among all the ensembles, S2 with porphyrin core shows the highest ROS generation efficiency, specific interaction towards lysosome, and strong emission for probing cells. Moreover, the cellular and living experiments confirm that S2 owns excellent PDT efficacy, biocompatibility, and biosafety. As such, this work will shed light on the advancement of more efficient PSs with potential clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Engineered Large&#8208;Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing uniform covalent organic framework (COF) film on substrates for electronic devices is highly desirable. Here, a simple and mild strategy is developed to prepare them by polymerization on a solid&#8208;liquid interface. The universality of the method is confirmed by the successful preparation of five COF films with different microstructures. These films have large lateral size, controllable thickness, and high crystalline quality. And COF patterns can also be directly achieved on substrates via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interface engineering, which is in favor of preparing device array. For application studies, the PyTTA&#8208;TPA (PyTTA: 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8244;&#8208;(1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene and TPA: terephthalaldehyde) COF film has a high photoresponsivity of 59.79 &#956;A W&#8211;1 at 420 nm for photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection. When employed as an active material for optoelectronic synaptic devices for the first attempt, it shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties such as short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), and the conversion of STP to LTP, which can be used to simulate biological synaptic functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Assembly of Highly Oxidized Cobalt on Graphdiyne Surface for Efficient Conversion of Nitrogen into Nitric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO3) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO3 from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp&#8208;C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5%) were achieved at low potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Dinitroxide Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization to Enhance Overall NMR Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR at 9.4 T and 100 K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build&#8208;up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. NaphPol and HydroPol are found to provide the best overall sensitivity factors, in organic and aqueous solvents respectively. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, provides good sensitivity for all three solvent formulations measured here, and can be considered to be a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarization agent.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Determination of the Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground State of Tridecacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open&#8208;shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on&#8208;surface synthesis of tridecacene molecule by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of the inelastic signal at 126 meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to the spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carry out many&#8208;body ab&#8208;initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonian to take into account the effect of metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamical electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap. Therefore, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Calcium Overload from Endogenous Sources for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing reactive calcium&#8208;based nanogenerators to produce excess calcium ions (Ca2+) in tumor cells is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, nanogenerators that introduce exogenous Ca2+ are either overactive incapable of on&#8208;demand release, or excessively inert incapable of an overload of calcium rapidly. Herein, inspired by inherently diverse Ca2+&#8208;regulating channels, a photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ nanomodulator that fully utilizes endogenous Ca2+ from dual sources was designed to achieve Ca2+ overload in tumor cells. Specifically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used to co&#8208;load bifunctional indocyanine green as a photodynamic/photothermal agent and a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (BNN&#8208;6). Thereafter, they were coated with hyaluronic acid, which served as a tumor cell&#8208;targeting unit and a gatekeeper. Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate reactive oxygen species that stimulate the transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel to realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. Simultaneously, the converted heat can induce BNN&#8208;6 decomposition to generate NO, which would open the ryanodine receptor channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ influx and release could enable Ca2+ overload in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single Set of Well&#8208;Designed Aptamer Probes for Reliable On&#8208;site Qualitative and Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Quantitative Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer&#8208;based probes are pivotal components in various sensing strategies, owing to their exceptional specificity and versatile programmable structure. Nevertheless, numerous aptamer&#8208;based probes usually offer only a single function, limiting their capacity to meet the diverse requirements of multi&#8208;faceted sensing systems. Here, we introduced supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA), designed and modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls, enabling dual functionality: qualitative detection for on&#8208;site analysis and quantitative detection for precise analysis. The fragmented DNAs resulting from the target recognition, are subsequently identified through lateral flow assays, enabling robust on&#8208;site qualitative detection of microcystin&#8208;LR with an impressively low limit of detection (LOD) at 0.01 &#956;g/L. Meanwhile, the nanochannels enable highly sensitive quantification of microcystin&#8208;LR through the current analysis, achieving an exceptionally low LOD at 2.5 &#215; 10&#8208;7 &#956;g/L, with a broad dynamic range spanning from 1 &#215; 10&#8208;6 to 1 &#215; 102 &#956;g/L. Furthermore, the process of target recognition introduces just a single potential error propagation, which reduces the overall risk of errors during the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process. This sensing strategy broadens the scope of applications for aptamer&#8208;based composite probes, holding promising implications across diverse fields, such as medical diagnosis, food safety, and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;like Niobovanadate Cage Built from {(Nb)V5} Pentagon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The striking aesthetic appeal of fullerene&#8208;like clusters has captured the interest of researchers. Nevertheless, the assembly of fullerene&#8208;like polyoxovadanadate (POV) cages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable pentagonal motif. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic POV cage, {(V2O)V30Nb12O102(H2O)12} (V30Nb12), by introducing Nb into the POVs. V30Nb12 is assembled by 12 heterometallic {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, reminiscent of C60. To our knowledge, the fullerene&#8208;like V30Nb12 not only represents the highest&#8208;nuclearity POV cage but also stands as the first niobovanadate cluster. Notably, V30Nb12 exhibits excellent solution stability, as confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS, FT&#8208;IR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. As there is no protection organic ligand on its outer surface, V30Nb12 can be further modified with Cu&#8208;complexes to form a fullerene&#8208;like cluster based zigzag chain (Cu&#8208;V30Nb12).</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Quenching of Hydrophobic Ag29 Nanoclusters Caused by Molecular Decoupling during Aqueous Phase Transfer and Emission Recovery through Supramolecular Recoupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting emissive hydrophobic nanoclusters for hydrophilic applications remains challenging due to the photoluminescence (PL) quenching with the phase transfer. In addition, the underlying mechanism of such a PL quenching remains a mystery. The present study elucidated the PL quenching mechanism by analyzing the atomically precise structures and optical properties of a surface&#8208;engineered Ag29 nanocluster with an all&#8208;around&#8208;carboxyl functionalized surface. Specifically, the phase transfer&#8208;triggered PL quenching was justified as the molecular decoupling, which directed an unfixed cluster surface and the weakened radiative transition. Furthermore, the emission recovery of the quenched nanoclusters was accomplished via a supramolecular recoupling approach through the GSH addition&#8208;induced aggregation of cluster molecules, wherein the restriction of intracluster motions and intercluster rotations strengthened the radiative transition of clusters. The findings in this work offer a new perspective on structure&#8208;emission correlations for atomically precise nanoclusters, hopefully shedding light on the fabrication of more highly emissive cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials aiming at downstream hydrophilic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>NeuM: A Neuron&#8208;Selective Probe Incorporates into Live Neuronal Membranes via Enhanced Clathrin&#8208;Mediated Endocytosis in Primary Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we introduce NeuM, a fluorescent probe for the selective labeling of live&#8208;neuronal membranes. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM self&#8208;assembles into micelles, which are selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes and integrated into the neuronal membrane through the endocytic recycling pathway. MD simulations demonstrated that NeuM has optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers.







Abstract
The development of a small&#8208;molecule probe designed to selectively target neurons would enhance the exploration of intricate neuronal structures and functions. Among such probes, NeuO stands out as the pioneer and has gained significant traction in the field of research. Nevertheless, neither the mechanism behind neuron&#8208;selectivity nor the cellular localization has been determined. Here, we introduce NeuM, a derivative of NeuO, designed to target neuronal cell membranes. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism behind the selective neuronal membrane trafficking that distinguishes neurons. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM autonomously assembles into micellar structures, leading to the quenching of its fluorescence (&#934;=0.001). Upon exposure to neurons, NeuM micelles were selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes via clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Through the endocytic recycling pathway, NeuM micelles integrate into neuronal membrane, dispersing fluorescent NeuM molecules in the membrane (&#934;=0.61). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that NeuM, in comparison to NeuO, possesses optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers. The stable integration of NeuM within neuronal membrane allows the prolonged monitoring of neurons, as well as the visualization of intricate neuronal structures.

&lt;p&gt;Here we introduce NeuM, a fluorescent probe for the selective labeling of live-neuronal membranes. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM self-assembles into micelles, which are selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes and integrated into the neuronal membrane through the endocytic recycling pathway. MD simulations demonstrated that NeuM has optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Fluoroethylene Carbonate on the Stability of Sb||Graphite Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries in Propylene Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the addition of FEC, a robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase formed on the surface of Sb anode and graphite cathode, inhibiting the pulverization of Sb and the expansion of graphite. The formation of FEC&#8208;rich anions solvation structure facilitates the insertion of PF6&#8722;, which significantly improves the reversible capacity. Thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced performance of high voltage and power density Sb||graphite dual&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have attracted increasing attention due to their high operative voltages and low&#8208;cost raw materials. However, the practical applications of Na&#8208;DIBs are still hindered by the issues, such as low capacity and poor Coulombic efficiency, which is highly correlated with the compatibility between electrode and electrolyte but rarely investigated. Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into the electrolyte to regulate cation/anion solvation structure and the stability of cathode/anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase of Na&#8208;DIBs. The FEC modulates the environment of PF6&#8722; solvation sheath and facilitates the interaction of PF6&#8722; on graphite. In addition, the NaF&#8208;rich interphase caused by the preferential decomposition of FEC effectively inhibits side reactions and pulverization of anodes with the electrolyte. Consequently, Sb||graphite full cells in FEC&#8208;containing electrolyte achieve an improved capacity, cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency. This work elucidates the underlying mechanism of bifunctional FEC and provides an alternative strategy of building high&#8208;performance dual ion batteries.

         <title>Pd8 Nanocluster with Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal&#8208; Ring Coordination and Promising Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered Pd nanoclusters are synthesized and precisely characterized. Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208; ring coordination is reported, which contributes to the exceptional stability of the as&#8208;obtained nanocluster, as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, the horizontal electron transition induces superb photothermal conversion efficiency of 73.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Constructing ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials with atomic precision and understanding their underlying stability mechanisms are challenging. Here, stable single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanoclusters of Pd were synthesized and precisely characterized through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. A pseudo&#8208;pentalene&#8208;like Pd8 unit was found in the nanocluster, interacting with two syn PPh units through nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination. The unexpected coordination, which is distinctly different from the typical organoring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination in half&#8208;sandwich&#8208;type organometallic compounds, contributes to the ambient stability of the as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanocluster as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations revealed dominant electron transition along the horizontal x&#8208;direction of the Pd8 plane, indicating high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the nanocluster, which was verified by the experimental PCE of 73.3&#8201;%. Therefore, this study unveils the birth of a novel type of compound and the finding of the unusual nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination and has important implications for future syntheses, structures, properties, and structure&#8211;property correlations of single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A General Synthesis of Nanostructured Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks from Insulating MOF Precursors for Supercapacitors and Chemiresistive Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template strategy has been developed for the general synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with high crystallinity, tailored morphologies, and high porosity via insulating MOFs&#8208;to&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs transformations. These nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs show great potential in supercapacitors and chemiresistive H2S sensors.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique subclass of layer&#8208;stacked crystalline coordination polymers that simultaneously possess porous and conductive properties, and have broad application potential in energy and electronic devices. However, to make the best use of the intrinsic electronic properties and structural features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, the controlled synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs with high crystallinity and customized morphologies is essential, which remains a great challenge. Herein, we present a template strategy to synthesize a library of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with controlled morphologies and dimensions via insulating MOFs&#8208;to&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs transformations. The resultant hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature intrinsic electrical conductivity and higher surface areas than the reported bulk&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;MOFs, which are beneficial for improved access to active sites and enhanced mass transport. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications, the hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs exhibit a superior performance for electrical properties related applications (hollow Cu&#8208;BHT nanocubes&#8208;based supercapacitor and Cu&#8208;HHB nanoflowers&#8208;based chemiresistive gas sensor), achieving over 225&#8201;% and 250&#8201;% improvement in specific capacity and response intensity over the corresponding bulk type c&#8208;MOFs, respectively.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptor Featuring Unique Self&#8208;Regulation Effect for Organic Solar Cells with 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;regulation effect is well demonstrated by finely tuning the aggregation behavior of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) Z9, where the tethered phenyl groups worked as endogenous additives and participated in intermolecular packing enabling the formation of 3D charge transport channels with super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. NFA Z9 forms optimal nanomorphology with polymer donors without external additives, and a high PCE of 19.0&#8201;% is achieved.







Abstract
The blend nanomorphology of electron&#8208;donor (D) and &#8208;acceptor (A) materials is of vital importance to achieving highly efficient organic solar cells. Exogenous additives especially aromatic additives are always needed to further optimize the nanomorphology of blend films, which is hardly compatible with industrial manufacture. Herein, we proposed a unique approach to meticulously modulate the aggregation behavior of NFAs in both crystal and thin film nanomorphology via self&#8208;regulation effect. Nonfullerene acceptor Z9 was designed and synthesized by tethering phenyl groups on the inner side chains of the Y6 backbone. Compared with Y6, the tethered phenyl groups participated in the molecular aggregation via the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl&#8208;phenyl and phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC&#8208;2F) groups, which induced 3D charge transport with phenyl&#8208;mediated super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. Moreover, ordered molecular packing with suitable phase separation was observed in Z9&#8208;based blend films. High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.0&#8201;% (certified PCE of 18.6&#8201;%) for Z9&#8208;based devices were achieved without additives, indicating the great potential of the self&#8208;regulation strategy in NFA design.

&lt;p&gt;The self-regulation effect is well demonstrated by finely tuning the aggregation behavior of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) Z9, where the tethered phenyl groups worked as endogenous additives and participated in intermolecular packing enabling the formation of 3D charge transport channels with super-exchange electron coupling. NFA Z9 forms optimal nanomorphology with polymer donors without external additives, and a high PCE of 19.0&#8201;% is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blend nanomorphology of electron-donor (D) and -acceptor (A) materials is of vital importance to achieving highly efficient organic solar cells. Exogenous additives especially aromatic additives are always needed to further optimize the nanomorphology of blend films, which is hardly compatible with industrial manufacture. Herein, we proposed a unique approach to meticulously modulate the aggregation behavior of NFAs in both crystal and thin film nanomorphology via self-regulation effect. Nonfullerene acceptor Z9 was designed and synthesized by tethering phenyl groups on the inner side chains of the Y6 backbone. Compared with Y6, the tethered phenyl groups participated in the molecular aggregation via the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl-phenyl and phenyl-2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F) groups, which induced 3D charge transport with phenyl-mediated super-exchange electron coupling. Moreover, ordered molecular packing with suitable phase separation was observed in Z9-based blend films. High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.0&#8201;% (certified PCE of 18.6&#8201;%) for Z9-based devices were achieved without additives, indicating the great potential of the self-regulation strategy in NFA design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Measurement of Accumulation of Antibiotics to Staphylococcus aureus in Phagosomes of Live Macrophages
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staphylococcus aureus can persist within host immune cells, potentially evading immune responses and antibiotics. Investigating antibiotic permeability into phagocytic vacuoles, we developed a permeability assay. By analyzing antibiotic arrival in phagosomes of infected macrophages, we identified permeability differences, offering insights into antibiotic contribution to intracellular pathogens.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) has evolved the ability to persist after uptake into host immune cells. This intracellular niche enables S.&#8197;aureus to potentially escape host immune responses and survive the lethal actions of antibiotics. While the elevated tolerance of S.&#8197;aureus to small&#8208;molecule antibiotics is likely to be multifactorial, we pose that there may be contributions related to permeation of antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles, which would require translocation across two mammalian bilayers. To empirically test this, we adapted our recently developed permeability assay to determine the accumulation of FDA&#8208;approved antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles of live macrophages. Bioorthogonal reactive handles were metabolically anchored within the surface of S.&#8197;aureus, and complementary tags were chemically added to antibiotics. Following phagocytosis of tagged S.&#8197;aureus cells, we were able to specifically analyze the arrival of antibiotics within the phagosomes of infected macrophages. Our findings enabled the determination of permeability differences between extra&#8208; and intracellular S.&#8197;aureus, thus providing a roadmap to dissect the contribution of antibiotic permeability to intracellular pathogens.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Micro&#8208;Hydrophobic Effect Regulates Benzene Methylation in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 were identified by using solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations. The micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects induced by the local water molecules in ZSM&#8208;5 channels can drive the benzene molecules towards to surface methoxy species (SMS) to form the active SMS&#8208;Benzene complex, which promotes benzene methylation.







Abstract
Water is a ubiquitous component in heterogeneous catalysis over zeolites and can significantly influence the catalyst performance. However, the detailed mechanism insights into zeolite&#8208;catalyzed reactions under microscale aqueous environment remain elusive. Here, using multiple dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations, we establish a fundamental understanding of the role of water in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite under water vapor conditions. We show that water competes with benzene for the active sites of zeolite and facilitates the bimolecular reaction mechanism. The growth of water clusters induces a micro&#8208;hydrophobic effect in zeolite pores, which reorients benzene molecules and drives their interactions with surface methoxy species (SMS) on zeolite. We identify the formation and evolution of active SMS&#8208;Benzene complexes in a microscale aqueous environment and demonstrate that their accumulation in zeolite pores boosts benzene conversion and methylation.

         <title>Structure of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP Bound to the Covalent Active&#8208;Site Inhibitor Cystargolide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two clpP genes next to the biosynthetic genes for the cystargolides in Kitasatospora cystarginea provided the impetus to test the natural products for anti&#8208;ClpP activity. Cystargolides emerged as covalent ClpP inhibitors and are the first &#946;&#8208;lactones for which ClpP co&#8208;crystal structures could be solved. The molecular inhibition mechanism is presented.







Abstract
The caseinolytic protease is a highly conserved serine protease, crucial to prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and a promising antibacterial and anticancer drug target. Herein, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural &#946;&#8208;lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP. Based on the discovery of two clpP genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in Kitasatospora cystarginea, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods in vitro. Synthesis of semisynthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in S. aureus cells and to demonstrate the anti&#8208;virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from S. aureus, Aquifex aeolicus, and Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by &#946;&#8208;lactones, the predominant class of ClpP inhibitors.

         <title>Relationships Between Defectivity and Porosity in High Surface Area Porous Aromatic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their high apparent surface areas and robust chemical stability, porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are being investigated to address a variety of technological challenges where material stability and porosity govern performance. A challenge complicating the synthesis of these materials is the strong dependence of their porosity on synthetic pathway. In this paper, we show that porosity is dependent on defectivity and that defectivity varies significantly between synthetic approaches..







Abstract
Porous aromatic framework (PAF) microporosity is known to be strongly dependent on synthetic approach but little is known about why certain reactions yield significantly and consistently more porous PAFs. This article explores the connections between synthetic pathway, PAF defectivity, and microporosity. Using a network disassembly strategy, we show that defectivity is highly dependent on synthetic approach and that more defective PAFs are associated with lower surface areas and pore volumes. This empirical association is corroborated through systematic introduction of defects to a modelPAF, which results in significant reduction of apparent surface area and pore volumes. Taken together, these data suggest that only highly efficient coupling reactions should be targeted for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high surface area porous aromatic frameworks.

         <title>Boosting H+ Storage in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries via Integrating Redox&#8208;Active Sites into Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking</title>

We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active hydrogen bonding organic framework with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interacting assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene as the cathode material for boosting H+ storage in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage.







Abstract
In the emerging aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), proton (H+) with the smallest molar mass and fast (de)coordination kinetics is considered as the most ideal charge carrier compared with Zn2+ counterpart, however, searching for new hosting materials for H+ storage is still at its infancy. Herein, redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene (HOF&#8208;HATN) are for the first time developed as the stable cathode hosting material for boosting H+ storage in AZIBs. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage. As a consequence, HOF&#8208;HATN displays a high capacity (320&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and robust cyclability of (&gt;10000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) based on three&#8208;step cation coordination storage. These findings get insight into the proton transport and storage behavior in HOFs and provide the molecular engineering strategy for constructing well&#8208;defined cathode hosting materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Photoexcitation of Distinct Divalent Palladium Complexes in Cross&#8208;Coupling Amination Under Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium photocatalytic method is reported for the successful synthesis of primary anilines by the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides and sodium azide under open&#8208;air conditions at room temperature. For the first time, diverse divalent palladium complexes are shown to undergo photoexcitation to give carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) cross&#8208;coupled product under air without using sophisticated ligands.







Abstract
The development of metal complexes that function as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst remains a challenging research topic. So far, progress has been shown in palladium(0) excited&#8208;state transition metal catalysis for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds where the oxidative addition of alkyl/aryl halides to zero&#8208;valent palladium (Pd0) is achievable at room temperature. In contrast, the analogous process with divalent palladium (PdII) is uphill and endothermic. For the first time, we report that divalent palladium can act as a light&#8208;absorbing species that undergoes double excitation to realize carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) cross&#8208;couplings under air. Differently substituted aryl halides can be applied in the mild, and selective cross&#8208;coupling amination using palladium acetate as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst at room temperature. Density functional theory studies supported by mechanistic investigations provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Three in One: Three Different Molybdates Trapped in a Thiacalix[4]arene Protected Ag72 Nanocluster for Structural Transformation and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different molybdates were trapped simultaneously in a thiacalix[4]arene&#8208;protected Ag72 nanocluster (Ag72b). The reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc resulted in the formation of a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a), whereas reaction with PhCOOAg gave a Ag28 nanocluster&#8208;based 1D chain structure (Ag28a). Photothermal conversion performance demonstrated that the Ag28a is superior to the Ag72b.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent crucial intermediates in the formation of insoluble metal oxides from soluble metal ions, however, the rapid hydrolysis&#8208;condensation kinetics of MoVI or WVI makes the direct characterization of coexisted molecular species in a given medium extremely difficult. Silver nanoclusters have shown versatile capacity to encapsulate diverse POMs, which provides an alternative scene to appreciate landscape of POMs in atomic precision. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanocluster (Ag72b) that simultaneously encapsulates three kinds of molybdates (MoO42&#8722;, Mo6O228&#8722; and Mo7O258&#8722;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo6O192&#8722;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. Ag72b is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster. The post&#8208;reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc or PhCOOAg produces a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a) or an Ag28 nanocluster based 1D chain structure (Ag28a), respectively. Moreover, the post&#8208;synthesized Ag28a can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom&#8208;precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.

         <title>Effective Inhibition of TDP&#8208;43 Aggregation by Native State Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is an essential co&#8208;pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we developed two strategies to stabilize the native&#8208;state TDP&#8208;43 against its aggregation, namely by phosphomimetic substitutions in the C&#8208;terminus, and by small&#8208;molecule modulation. Our results represent the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on functional TDP&#8208;43 targeting and related drug discovery.







Abstract
Preventing the misfolding or aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is the most actively pursued disease&#8208;modifying strategy to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we provide proof of concept that native state stabilization of TDP&#8208;43 is a viable and effective strategy for treating TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies. Firstly, we leveraged the Cryo&#8208;EM structures of TDP&#8208;43 fibrils to design C&#8208;terminal substitutions that disrupt TDP&#8208;43 aggregation. Secondly, we showed that these substitutions (S333D/S342D) stabilize monomeric TDP&#8208;43 without altering its physiological properties. Thirdly, we demonstrated that binding native oligonucleotide ligands stabilized monomeric TDP&#8208;43 and prevented its fibrillization and phase separation in the absence of direct binding to the aggregation&#8208;prone C&#8208;terminal domain. Fourthly, we showed that the monomeric TDP&#8208;43 variant could be induced to aggregate in a controlled manner, which enabled the design and implementation of a high&#8208;throughput screening assay to identify native state stabilizers of TDP&#8208;43. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that different structural domains in TDP&#8208;43 could be exploited and targeted to develop drugs that stabilize the native state of TDP&#8208;43 and provide a platform to discover novel drugs to treat TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies.

         <title>Structural Basis of the Bivalency of the TRPV1 Agonist DkTx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using protein&#8208;splicing, we produced a labelled bivalent capsaicin receptor agonist, DkTx, for NMR characterisation. The structure reveals linker pre&#8208;organisation stabilised by interaction between the first domain and the linker. Disrupting this reduces linker order, affecting avidity at sub&#8208;saturating concentrations, illustrating how linker order enhances potency of bivalent receptor engagement.







Abstract
Bivalency is a prevalent natural mechanism to enhance receptor avidity. Various two&#8208;domain disulfide&#8208;rich peptides exhibiting bivalent action have been identified from animal venoms. A unique characteristic of these peptides is that they induce a pharmacological response different from that provoked by any of the constituent domains. The enhanced potency and avidity of such peptides is therefore a consequence of their domain fusion by a peptide linker. The role of the linker itself, beyond conjugation, remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the linker affects the bivalency of the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) agonist DkTx. We recombinantly produced isotope labelled DkTx using a protein splicing approach, to solve the high&#8208;resolution solution structure of DkTx, revealing residual linker order stabilised by linker&#8208;domain interactions leading to biased domain orientations. The significance of this was studied using a combination of mutagenesis, spin relaxation studies and electrophysiology measurements. Our results reveal that disrupting the pre&#8208;organisation of the domains of DkTx is accompanied by reductions in potency and onset of avidity. Our findings support a model of pre&#8208;configured two&#8208;domain binding, in favour of the previously suggested sequential binding model. This highlights the significance of ordered elements in linker design and the natural evolution of these in bivalent toxins.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalently Stapled H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels Activatable by Visible Light for Targeted Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully constructed the first example of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by 442&#8197;nm visible light, enabling the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8722; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10&#8197;min, 90&#8201;% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells.







Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels, capable of specifically disturbing the intracellular ion homeostasis of cancer cells, presents an intriguing opportunity for achieving high selectivity in cancer therapy. Herein, we describe a novel family of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by biocompatible visible light at 442&#8197;nm, which enables the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8722; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10&#8197;min, 90&#8201;% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells (IC50=8.5&#8197;&#956;M). The mechanism underlying cancer cell death mediated by the H+/Cl&#8722; channels involves the activation of the caspase&#8197;9 apoptosis pathway as well as the scarcely reported disruption of the autophagic processes. In the absence of photoirradiation, C4F&#8208;L exhibits minimal toxicity towards normal intestine cells, even at a concentration of 200&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Drives the Electrochemical Oxidation of Silane to Silanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a Mn single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) stabilized on N&#8208;doped carbon via thermal decomposition of a ZIF (Mn&#8208;SA@NC). By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn&#8208;SA@NC drives the electrochemical oxidation of silane to silanol. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), characterized by a four&#8208;electron transfer kinetic process, represents a significant bottleneck in improving the efficiency of hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Consequently, extensive research efforts have been directed towards identifying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with exceptional OER performance. Despite the comprehensive understanding of the OER mechanism, its application to other valuable synthetic reactions has been limited. Herein, we leverage the MOOH intermediate, a key species in the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst (Mn&#8208;SA@NC), which can be cyclically delivered in the OER. We exploit this intermediate&#8217; s capability to facilitate electrophilic transfer with silane, enabling efficient silane oxidation under electrochemical conditions. The SAC electrocatalytic system exhibits remarkable performance with catalyst loadings as low as 600&#8197;ppm and an exceptional turnover number of 9132. Furthermore, the catalytic method demonstrates stability under a 10&#8197;mmol flow chemistry setup. By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn&#8208;SA@NC drives the entire reaction, establishing a practical Mn SAC&#8208;catalyzed organic electrosynthesis system. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.

         <title>Living Materials Based Dynamic Information Encryption via Light&#8208;Inducible Bacterial Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli/eLightOn&#8208;smCSE) that biosynthesize CdS quantum dots (QDs) in response to light can be utilized for dynamic information encryption. By harnessing the advantage of living materials, this approach introduces three layers of security: the information remains invisible under natural light, becomes readable only with specific substrates, and auto&#8208;deletes after access.







Abstract
Microbial biosynthesis, as an alternative method for producing quantum dots (QDs), has gained attention because it can be conducted under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, distinguishing it from conventional chemical and physical synthesis approaches. However, there is currently no method to selectively control this biosynthesis process in a subset of microbes within a population using external stimuli. In this study, we have attained precise and selective control over the microbial biosynthesis of QDs through the utilization of an optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli). The recombinant E. coli is designed to express smCSE enzyme, under the regulation of eLightOn system, which can be activated by blue light. The smCSE enzymes use L&#8208;cysteine and Cd2+ as substrates to form CdS QDs. This system enables light&#8208;inducible bacterial biosynthesis of QDs in precise patterns within a hydrogel for information encryption. As the biosynthesis progresses, the optical characteristics of the QDs change, allowing living materials containing the recombinant E. coli to display time&#8208;dependent patterns that self&#8208;destruct after reading. Compared to static encryption using fluorescent QD inks, dynamic information encryption based on living materials offers enhanced security.

To avoid droplet coalescence, fluoropolymer&#8208;based surfactants are commonly used to reduce the interfacial tension between two immiscible phases to stabilize droplet interfaces. However, the conventional preparation of fluorosurfactants involves multiple steps of conjugation reactions between fluorinated and hydrophilic segments to form multiple&#8208;block copolymers. In addition, synthesis of customized surfactants with tailored properties is challenging due to the complex synthesis process. Here, we report a highly efficient synthetic method that utilizes living radical polymerization (LRP) to produce fluorosurfactants with tailored functionalities. Compared to the commercialized surfactant, our surfactants outperform in thermal cycling for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and exhibit exceptional biocompatibility for cell and yeast culturing in a double&#8208;emulsion system. This breakthrough synthetic approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics by enabling the development of novel designs that generate droplets with superior stability and functionality for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Fast Interfacial Carrier Dynamics Modulated by Bidirectional Charge Transport Channels in ZnIn2S4&#8208;based Composite Photoanodes Probed by Scanning Photoelectrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy that can synchronously modulate the simultaneous migration of electrons and holes in different directions on the photoanode to improve PEC performance was reported. This work can deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation and provide valuable guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrode materials.







Abstract
Limited charge separation/transport efficiency remains the primary obstacle of achieving satisfying photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. Therefore, it is essential to develop diverse interfacial engineering strategies to mitigate charge recombination. Despite obvious progress having been made, most works only considered a single&#8208;side modulation in either the electrons of conduction band or the holes of valence band in a semiconductor photoanode, leading to a limited PEC performance enhancement. Beyond this conventional thinking, we developed a novel coupling modification strategy to achieve a composite electrode with bidirectional carrier transport for a better charge separation, in which Ti2C3Tx MXene quantum dots (MQDs) and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots (FO) are anchored on the surface of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanoplates, resulting in markedly improved PEC water splitting of pure ZIS photoanode. Systematic studies indicated that the bidirectional charge transfer pathways were stimulated due to MQDs as &#8220;electron extractor&#8221; and S&#8722;O bonds as carriers transport channels, which synergistically favors significantly enhanced charge separation. The enhanced kinetic behavior at the FO/MQDs/ZIS interfaces was systematically and quantitatively evaluated by a series of methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation, and provide valuable guidance for the rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrodes.

         <title>Crystal Growth Regulation of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites via Self&#8208;Assembly of Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We incorporated robust quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions to regulate the crystal growth of 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites. This was achieved through the development of two unique semiconductor spacers, namely PTMA and 5FPTMA, with different dipole moments. Devices utilizing films incorporating these interactions exhibited a significant efficiency enhancement, increasing from 15.66&#8201;% to 18.56&#8201;%.







Abstract
The crystal growth and orientation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite films significantly impact solar cell performance. Here, we incorporated robust quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions to govern the crystal growth of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites. This was achieved through the development of two unique semiconductor spacers, namely PTMA and 5FPTMA, with different dipole moments. The ((5FPTMA)0.1(PTMA)0.9)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, 5F/PTMA&#8722;Pb) film shows a preferred vertical orientation, reduced grain boundaries, and released residual strain compared to (PTMA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, PTMA&#8722;Pb), resulting in a decreased exciton binding energy and reduced electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficients. In contrast to PTMA&#8722;Pb device with an efficiency of 15.66&#8201;%, the 5F/PTMA&#8722;Pb device achieved a champion efficiency of 18.56&#8201;%, making it among the best efficiency for 2D RP perovskite solar cells employing an MA&#8208;based semiconductor spacer. This work offers significant insights into comprehending the crystal growth process of 2D RP perovskite films through the utilization of quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions between semiconductor spacers.

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new condensation system was developed for integrating helicene &#960; units into 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D helicene materials via C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The 2D helicene frameworks are chemically robust, enable extended &#960; conjugation over 2D planes, create low band gap, exhibit exceptional photoconductivity, and achieve benchmark efficient red emission, opening a way to novel &#960; electronic materials.







Abstract
Helicenes are a class of fascinating chiral helical molecules with rich chemistry developed continuously over the past 100&#8197;years. Their helical, conjugated, and twisted structures make them attractive for constructing molecular systems. However, studies over the past century are mainly focused on synthesizing helicenes with increased numbers of aromatic rings and complex heterostructures, while research on inorganic, organic, and polymeric helicene materials is still embryonic. Herein, we report the first examples of helicene covalent organic frameworks, i.e., [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1, by condensing [7]Helicene dialdehyde with trimethyl triazine via the C=C bond formation reaction under solvothermal conditions. The resultant [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits prominent X&#8208;ray diffraction peaks and assumes a highly ordered 2D lattice structure originated from the twisted configuration of [7]Helicene unit. The C=C linked [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 materials exhibited extended &#960; conjugation and broadly tuned their absorption, emission, redox activity, photoconductivity, and light&#8208;emitting activity, demonstrating rich multifunctionalities and great potentials in developing various applications. This work opens a way to a new family of COFs as well as helicene materials, enabling the exploration of unprecedented &#960; architectures and properties.

         <title>Controlled cluster expansion at a Zintl cluster surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise growth of eleven&#8208; and twelve&#8208;vertex multimetallic clusters from a ten&#8208;atom precursor is demonstrated. These rare examples of closo&#8208; to closo&#8208; cluster expansion reactions offer insight into the mechanisms by which Zintl clusters assemble in solution. The resultant clusters possess exo&#8208;bonds to chlorine atoms that may allow for post&#8208;synthetic functionalization and their incorporation into materials.







Abstract
Reaction of the tris&#8208;hypersilyl nonagermanide Zintl cluster salt, K[Ge9(Hyp)3] (Hyp=Si(SiMe3)3) with [Rh(&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;L)Cl]2 (L=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, COD; norbornadiene, NBD) afforded eleven&#8208; and twelve&#8208;vertex homo&#8208;multimetallic clusters by cluster core expansion. Using a stepwise procedure, starting from the Zintl cluster [Rh(COD){Ge9(Hyp)3}] and [Ir(COD)Cl]2, this methodology was expanded for the synthesis of eleven&#8208;vertex hetero&#8208;multimetallic clusters. A mechanism for the formation of these first examples of closo eleven&#8208;vertex Zintl clusters is proposed, informed by density functional theory calculations.

&lt;p&gt;Reaction of the tris-hypersilyl nonagermanide Zintl cluster salt, K[Ge&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(Hyp)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (Hyp=Si(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with [Rh(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-L)Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (L=1,5-cyclooctadiene, COD; norbornadiene, NBD) afforded eleven- and twelve-vertex &lt;i&gt;homo&lt;/i&gt;-multimetallic clusters by cluster core expansion. Using a stepwise procedure, starting from the Zintl cluster [Rh(COD){Ge&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(Hyp)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}] and [Ir(COD)Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this methodology was expanded for the synthesis of eleven-vertex &lt;i&gt;hetero&lt;/i&gt;-multimetallic clusters. A mechanism for the formation of these first examples of &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt; eleven-vertex Zintl clusters is proposed, informed by density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells: The Important Role of Seed Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs butylamine&#8208;capped CsPbI3 nanocrystals as additives of FAPbI3 film for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Well&#8208;defined CsPbI3 nanocrystals can not only manipulate the nucleation and growth of perovskite films but also release lattice strain to minimize defect concentrations. As a result, perovskite solar cells achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.41&#8201;%.







Abstract
Additive engineering has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Among additives, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have a similar chemical composition and matched lattice structure with the perovskite matrix, which can effectively enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, relevant studies remain limited, and most of them focus on bromide&#8208;involved perovskite NCs, which may undergo dissolution and ion exchange within the FAPbI3 host, potentially resulting in an enlarged band gap. In this work, we employ butylamine&#8208;capped CsPbI3 NCs (BPNCs) as additives in PSCs, which can be well maintained and serve as seeds for regulating the crystallization and growth of perovskite films. The resultant perovskite film exhibits larger domain sizes and fewer grain boundaries without compromising the band gap. Moreover, BPNCs can alleviate lattice strain and reduce defect densities within the active layer. The PSCs incorporating BPNCs show a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.41&#8201;%, well over both Control of 22.09&#8201;% and oleic acid/oleylamine capped CsPbI3 NC (PNC)&#8208;based devices of 23.11&#8201;%. This work illustrates the key role of nanosized seed surfaces in achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Scintillators for X&#8208;Ray Imaging Through Host&#8208;Guest Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve organic scintillators through constructing host&#8208;guest doping system was demonstrated. When doping guest materials with different triplet state energy levels, readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm) were achieved under X&#8208;ray excitation. The developed system also enabled color&#8208;tunable NIR X&#8208;ray imaging and provided a convenient visualization tool for X&#8208;ray radiography.







Abstract
With the increasing demands of X&#8208;ray detection and medical diagnosis, organic scintillators with intense and tunable X&#8208;ray excited emission have been becoming important. To guarantee the X&#8208;ray absorption, heavy atoms were widely added in reported organic scintillators, which led to emission quenching. In this work, we propose a new strategy to realize organic scintillators through the host&#8208;guest doping strategy. Then the X&#8208;ray absorption centers (host) and emission centers (guest) are separated. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, these materials displayed intense and readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm). Besides, the relationship between the X&#8208;ray absorption and spatial arrangement of the heavy atoms in the host matrix was also revealed. The potential application of these wide&#8208;range color tunable organic host&#8208;guest scintillators in X&#8208;ray imaging were demonstrated. This work provides a new feasible strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic scintillators with tunable luminescence properties.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene Incorporated Thiazole Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenophene substitution is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials, because it can realize higher mobility, lower&#8208;lying LUMO level compared with thiophene analogues. Here, we synthesize a thiazole imide&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer with maximum selenophene content and achieve a champion conductivity of 164.0&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is more than twice of that of selenophene&#8208;free analogue.







Abstract
Developing polymers with high electrical conductivity (&#963;) after n&#8208;doping is a great challenge for the advance of the field of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we report a series of thiazole imide&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers by gradually increasing selenophene content in polymeric backbone. Thanks to the strong intramolecular noncovalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interaction and enhanced intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se interaction, with the increase of selenophene content, the polymers show gradually lowered LUMOs, more planar backbone, and improved film crystallinity versus the selenophene&#8208;free analogue. Consequently, polymer PDTzSI&#8722;Se with the highest selenophene content achieves a champion &#963; of 164.0&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 49.0&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in the series when applied in OTEs after n&#8208;doping. The &#963; value is the highest one for n&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor OTE materials reported to date. Our work indicates that selenophene substitution is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OTE materials and selenophene incorporated thiazole imides offer an excellent platform in enabling n&#8208;type polymers with high backbone coplanarity, deep&#8208;lying LUMO and enhanced mobility/conductivity.

         <title>Simple and Efficient Synthesis of Novel Tetramers with Enhanced Glass Transition Temperature for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious synthesis strategy is proposed for novel tetramers with higher glass transition temperatures (Tg), simplifying intricate reaction steps and reducing synthetic complexity. The resulting Tet&#8208;1&#8208;based organic solar cell (OSC) demonstrates superior photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the higher Tg and lower diffusion coefficient contribute to excellent stability in the binary device.







Abstract
Oligomer acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered substantial attention owing to their impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability. However, the simple and efficient synthesis of oligomer acceptors with higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we propose an innovative strategy for the synthesis of tetramers, denoted as Tet&#8208;n, with elevated Tgs, achieved through only two consecutive Stille coupling reactions. Importantly, our strategy significantly reduces the redundancy in reaction steps compared to conventional methods for linear tetramer synthesis, thereby improving both reaction efficiency and yield. Furthermore, the OSC based on PM6:Tet&#8208;1 attains a high PCE of 17.32&#8201;%, and the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:Tet&#8208;1 ternary device achieves an even more higher PCE of 19.31&#8201;%. Remarkably, the binary device based on the Tet&#8208;1 tetramer demonstrates outstanding operational stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency (T80) even after 1706&#8197;h of continuous illumination, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced Tg (247&#8201;&#176;C) and lower diffusion coefficient (1.56&#215;10&#8722;27&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1). This work demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in the straightforward and efficient synthesis of tetramers materials with higher Tgs, thus offering a viable pathway for developing high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.

Furthermore, the OSC based on PM6:Tet-1 attains a high PCE of 17.32&#8201;%, and the PM6:L8-BO:Tet-1 ternary device achieves an even more higher PCE of 19.31&#8201;%. Remarkably, the binary device based on the Tet-1 tetramer demonstrates outstanding operational stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) even after 1706&#8197;h of continuous illumination, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; (247&#8201;&#176;C) and lower diffusion coefficient (1.56&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;27&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in the straightforward and efficient synthesis of tetramers materials with higher &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;s, thus offering a viable pathway for developing high-efficiency and stable OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of a Reactive [Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV)] Species and its Facile Equilibrium with Related Mn(IV)(OX) (X = Sc or H) Complexes</title>

Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;bound high&#8208;valent manganese&#8208;oxo species are important in understanding the role of Ca(II) ion in photosystem II. We present the synthesis and spectroscopic assessment of a novel Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV) species. This species opens up a new pathway for the synthesis of Mn(IV)&#8722;O&#8722;Sc(III) and Mn(IV)&#8722;OH, which are relevant to photosystem II.







Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;bound high valent Mn&#8208;oxo species are of great importance due to their relevance to photosystem II. Here, we report the synthesis of a unique [(BnTPEN)Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV)(NO3)4]+ adduct (2) by the reaction of (BnTPEN)Mn(II) (1) with 4&#8197;eq. ceric ammonium nitrate. 2 has been characterized using UV/Vis, NMR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry. Treatment of 2 with Sc(III)(OTf)3 results in the formation of (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8722;O&#8722;Sc(III) (3), while HClO4 addition to 2 forms (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8722;OH (4), reverting to 2 upon Ce(III)(NO3)3 addition. 2 can also be prepared by the oxidation of 1&#8197;eq. Ce(III)(NO3)3 with [(BnTPEN)Mn(IV)=O]2+ (5). In addition, the EPR spectroscopy revealed the elegant temperature&#8208;dependent equilibria between 2 and Mn(IV) species. The binding of redox&#8208;active Ce(IV) boosts electron transfer efficiency of 2 towards ferrocenes. Remarkably, the newly characterized Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV) species can carry out O&#8208;atom and H&#8208;atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Sculpting Mesoscopic Helical Chirality into Covalent Organic Framework Nanotubes from Entirely Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;, and hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with unique mesoscopic helical chirality were constructed from entirely achiral building blocks using helical amorphous imine&#8208;linked polymers as raw materials based on dynamic covalent chemistries. The crystallinity and helicity of the resulting COFs could be well balanced despite the whole process involved the covalent bonding breakage and reorganization.







Abstract
The diversification of chirality in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) holds immense promise for expanding their properties and functionality. Herein, we introduce an innovative approach for imparting helical chirality to COFs and fabricating a family of chiral COF nanotubes with mesoscopic helicity from entirely achiral building blocks for the first time. We present an effective 2,3&#8208;diaminopyridine&#8208;mediated supramolecular templating method, which facilitates the prefabrication of helical imine&#8208;linked polymer nanotubes using unprecedented achiral symmetric monomers. Through meticulous optimization of crystallization conditions, these helical polymer nanotubes are adeptly converted into imine&#8208;linked COF nanotubes boasting impressive surface areas, while well preserving their helical morphology and chiroptical properties. Furthermore, these helical imine&#8208;linked polymers or COFs could be subtly transformed into corresponding more stable and functional helical &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked and hydrazone&#8208;linked COF nanotubes with transferred circular dichroism via monomer exchange. Notably, despite the involvement of covalent bonding breakage and reorganization, these exchange processes overcome thermodynamic disadvantages, allowing mesoscopic helical chirality to be perfectly preserved. This research highlights the potential of mesoscopic helicity in conferring COFs with favourable chiral properties, providing novel insights into the development of multifunctional COFs in the field of chiral materials chemistry.

An M9 minimum media based on 13C&#8208;depleted glucose and 15N&#8208;depleted salt dissolved in D,18O&#8208;depleted water (Depleted media) was formulated. E. coli bacteria grow faster in Depleted media compared with isotopically natural media (Normal media). In addition, four different enzymes recombinantly produced in Depleted media showed faster kinetics compared with the enzymes produced in Normal media.







Abstract
Inorganic materials depleted of heavy stable isotopes are known to deviate strongly in some physicochemical properties from their isotopically natural counterparts. Here we explored for the first time the effect of simultaneous depletion of the heavy carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes on the bacterium E. coli and the enzymes expressed in it. Bacteria showed faster growth, with most proteins exhibiting higher thermal stability, while for recombinant enzymes expressed in depleted media, faster kinetics was discovered. At room temperature, luciferase, thioredoxin and dihydrofolate reductase and Pfu DNA polymerase showed up to a 250&#8201;% increase in activity compared to the native counterparts, with an additional &#8764;50&#8201;% increase at 10&#8201;&#176;C. Diminished conformational and vibrational entropy is hypothesized to be the cause of the accelerated kinetics. Ultralight enzymes may find an application where extreme reaction rates are required.

         <title>Triptycene Branched Poly(aryl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) Electrolytes for Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells and Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional and highly rigid triptycene was applied in poly(fluorene/dibenzyl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) as a branching agent for alkaline exchange polyelectrolytes, which shows excellent conductivity, mechanical properties, anti&#8208;swelling ability, and alkaline stability. The water electrolysis performance reaches current densities of 16 and 14.17&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using precious and non&#8208;precious catalysts in anode, respectively.







Abstract
Alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs) are essential materials for alkaline energy conversion devices such as anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Here, we report a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) with different branching agents (triptycene: highly&#8208;rigid, three&#8208;dimensional structure; triphenylbenzene: planar, two&#8208;dimensional structure) for high&#8208;performance APEs. Among them, triptycene branched APEs showed excellent hydroxide conductivity (193.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1@80&#8201;&#176;C), alkaline stability, mechanical properties, and dimensional stability due to the formation of branched network structures, and increased free volume. AEMFCs based on triptycene&#8208;branched APEs reached promising peak power densities of 2.503 and 1.705&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 75/100&#8201;% and 30/30&#8201;% (anode/cathode) relative humidity, respectively. In addition, the fuel cells can run stably at a current density of 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;h with a low voltage decay rate of 46&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1. Importantly, the related AEMWE achieved unprecedented current densities of 16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 14.17&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (@2&#8197;V, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;M NaOH) using precious and non&#8208;precious metal catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the AEMWE can be stably operated under 1.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;h. The excellent results suggest that the triptycene&#8208;branched APEs are promising candidates for future AEMFC and AEMWE applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs) are essential materials for alkaline energy conversion devices such as anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Here, we report a series of branched poly(aryl-co-aryl piperidinium) with different branching agents (triptycene: highly-rigid, three-dimensional structure; triphenylbenzene: planar, two-dimensional structure) for high-performance APEs. Among them, triptycene branched APEs showed excellent hydroxide conductivity (193.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@80&#8201;&#176;C), alkaline stability, mechanical properties, and dimensional stability due to the formation of branched network structures, and increased free volume. AEMFCs based on triptycene-branched APEs reached promising peak power densities of 2.503 and 1.705&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 75/100&#8201;% and 30/30&#8201;% (anode/cathode) relative humidity, respectively. In addition, the fuel cells can run stably at a current density of 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 500&#8197;h with a low voltage decay rate of 46&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Importantly, the related AEMWE achieved unprecedented current densities of 16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 14.17&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (@2&#8197;V, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;M NaOH) using precious and non-precious metal catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the AEMWE can be stably operated under 1.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;h. The excellent results suggest that the triptycene-branched APEs are promising candidates for future AEMFC and AEMWE applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidation of Styrenes into Ketones under Ambient Conditions Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex was found to be a highly active and Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalyst for the Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of aromatic olefins into ketones under ambient conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies including kinetics, UV/Vis, control experiments and DFT calculations indicate a Mukaiyama&#8208;type mechanism with a change in the last fundamental step towards ketone formation via an unprecedented hydrogen bonding network thanks to the ethanol solvent.







Abstract
The replacement of palladium catalysts for Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins into ketones by first&#8208;row transition metals is a relevant approach for searching more sustainable protocols. Besides highly sophisticated iron catalysts, all the other first&#8208;row transition metal complexes have only led to poor activities and selectivities. Herein, we show that the cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex is a competent catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of styrenes into ketones with silanes as the hydrogen sources. Remarkably, under room temperature and air atmosphere, the reactions were exceedingly fast (up to 10&#8197;minutes) with a low catalyst loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) while keeping an excellent chemo&#8208; and Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity (up to 99&#8201;% of ketone). Unprecedently high TOF (864&#8197;h&#8722;1) and TON (5,800) were reached for the oxidation of aromatic olefins under these benign conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest a reaction mechanism similar to the Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration of olefins with a change in the last fundamental step, which controls the chemoselectivity, thanks to a unique hydrogen bonding network between the ethanol solvent and the cobalt peroxo intermediate.

         <title>Non&#8208;Metallic NH4+/H+ Co&#8208;Storage in Organic Superstructures for Ultra&#8208;Fast and Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;metallic NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage is reported in high&#8208;redox&#8208;active carbonyls fully exposed organic superstructures, which conquers the kinetics barrier of sluggish Zn2+ ions and structural instability of repeated Zn2+ insertion in aqueous electrolytes. A two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron NH4+/H+ co&#8208;coordination mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, superior rate capability and ultralong life.







Abstract
Compared with Zn2+ storage, non&#8208;metallic charge carrier with small hydrated size and light weight shows fast dehydration and diffusion kinetics for Zn&#8208;organic batteries. Here we first report NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage in self&#8208;assembled organic superstructures (OSs) by intermolecular interactions of p&#8208;benzoquinone (BQ) and 2, 6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DQ) polymer through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. BQ&#8208;DQ OSs exhibit exposed quadruple&#8208;active carbonyl motifs and super electron delocalization routes, which are redox&#8208;exclusively coupled with high&#8208;kinetics NH4+/H+ but exclude sluggish and rigid Zn2+ ions. A unique 4e&#8722; NH4+/H+ co&#8208;coordination mechanism is unravelled, giving BQ&#8208;DQ cathode high capacity (299&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current tolerance (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultralong life (50,000 cycles). This strategy further boosts the capacity to 358&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 by modulating redox&#8208;active building units, giving new insights into ultra&#8208;fast and stable NH4+/H+ storage in organic materials for better Zn batteries.

         <title>An Electrolyte with Less Space&#8208;Occupying Diluent at Cathode Inner Helmholtz Plane for Stable 4.6&#8197;V Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>

The interaction between m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) and anion (DFOB&#8722;) is weak due to the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation structure of mFT, thus excluding mFT from the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). This facilitates the formation of an anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), enabling the graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell an excellent 4.6&#8197;V&#8208;cycling stability.







Abstract
Reasonably elevating the working voltage (&#8805;4.4&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) of the cathode is one of the efficient approaches to maximize the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). As a preferred partner for high&#8208;voltage LIB systems, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE), characterized by a stronger Li solvation structure, less free solvent, and robust electrode/electrolyte interphase has attracted much attention in academic circles. Herein, we systematically studied the role of the diluent in LHCE on the formation of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and elucidated that the existing anion&#8208;diluent pairing in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) results in an uneven CEI and subsequent battery degradation under high voltage. A m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) diluent was further employed in the LHCE containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) to facilitate a uniform and rich&#8208;anion&#8208;derived CEI, since the weaker interaction of HmFT&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, as compared to the HHhydrofluoroether&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, reduces the influence of mFT in IHP or initial CEI formation. Consequently, the mFT&#8208;dominated LHCE propels the high&#8208;voltage performance of LIBs one step forward, endowing a 4.6&#8197;V&#8208;class 1.2&#8208;Ah graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells a 90.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 130&#8197;cycles. Our study thus describes a new index affecting the CEI formation and proposes novel strategies to deeply optimize the high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Oxygen Vacancy and High Porosity of Nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for Enhanced Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 via the low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy possesses abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area, which facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. This work provides new possibilities for designing nano MOFs with controllable surface&#8208;active sites and high porosity.







Abstract
This work reports that a low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy was adopted to modulate the electronic structure and attain an abundance of surface&#8208;active sites while maintaining the crystal morphology. All the experiments demonstrate that the new photocatalyst nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 obtained by thermal calcination strategy has abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area. This facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The photocatalytic NH3 yield over MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 is enhanced to 156.9&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, over twice higher than that of the parent MIL&#8208;125(Ti) (76.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Combined with density function theory (DFT), it shows that the N2 adsorption pattern on the active sites tends to be from &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, which is thermodynamically favourable. Moreover, the electrochemical tests demonstrate that the high atomic ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ can enhance carrier separation, which also promotes the efficiency of photocatalytic N2 fixation. This work may offer new insights into the design of innovative photocatalysts for various chemical reduction reactions.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Modulated 2D Coordination Polymers for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis under Air and Pure Water Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers CuX&#8208;dptz were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at the gram level. CuX&#8208;dptz exhibits H2O2 photoproduction activity under pure water and open air without additives through an oxygen reduction process. The microenvironment of the Cu sites can be regulated by halogen atoms, which affects the electron transfer capability and substrate accessibility, and ultimately determines the catalytic activity.







Abstract
H2O2 is a widely used eco&#8208;friendly oxidant and a potential energy carrier. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from water and O2 is an ideal approach with the potential to address the current energy crisis and environmental issues. Three zig&#8208;zag two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D CPs), named CuX&#8208;dptz, were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at room temperature, showing preeminent H2O2 photoproduction performance under pure water and open air without any additives. CuBr&#8208;dptz exhibits a H2O2 production rate high up to 1874&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, exceeding most reported photocatalysts under this condition, even comparable to those supported by sacrificial agents and O2. The coordination environment of Cu can be modulated by halogen atoms (X=Cl, Br, I), which in turn affects the electron transfer process and finally determines the reaction activity. This is the first time that 2D CPs have been used for photocatalytic H2O2 production in such challenging conditions, which provides a new pathway for the development of portable in situ H2O2 photosynthesis devices.

         <title>Click to Self&#8208;immolation: A &#8220;Click&#8221; Functionalization Strategy towards Triggerable Self&#8208;Immolative Homopolymers and Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; approach based on a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol&#8208;isocyanate reaction was developed to functionalize self&#8208;immolative polymer precursors with varying trigger units and allow polymer&#8208;polymer coupling to access head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerizable block copolymers, which could undergo programmable self&#8208;immolation in response to specified stimuli.







Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are a class of degradable macromolecules that undergo stimuli&#8208;triggered head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerization. However, a general approach to readily end&#8208;functionalize SIP precursors for programmed degradation remains elusive, restricting access to complex, functional SIP&#8208;based materials. Here we present a &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; strategy based on aroyl azide&#8208;capped SIP precursors, enabling the facile construction of diverse SIPs with different trigger units through a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol/thiol&#8208;isocyanate &#8220;click&#8221; reaction. This strategy is also applied to polymer&#8208;polymer coupling to access fully depolymerizable block copolymer amphiphiles, even combining different SIP backbones. Our results demonstrate that the depolymerization can be actuated efficiently under physiologically&#8208;relevant conditions by the removal of the trigger units and ensuing self&#8208;immolation of the p&#8208;aminobenzyl carbonate linkage, indicating promise for controlled release applications involving nanoparticles and hydrogels.

         <title>A Universal Approach for Sustainable Urea Synthesis via Intermediate Assembly at the Electrode/Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling shows great potential in sustainable urea synthesis. We proposed a universal strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C&#8722;N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+&lt;Na+&lt;Cs+&lt;K+. With 1.0&#8197;M of K+, a world&#8208;record urea yield rate of 212.8&#177;10.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 has been achieved on a single&#8208;atom Co decorated TiO2 catalyst.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process is indeed a sustainable alternative for direct urea synthesis and co&#8208;upgrading of carbon dioxide and nitrate wastes. However, the main challenge lies in the unactivated C&#8722;N coupling process. Here, we proposed a strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C&#8722;N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+&lt;Na+&lt;Cs+&lt;K+. In the presence of K+, a world&#8208;record performance was achieved with a urea yield rate of 212.8&#177;10.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 on a single&#8208;atom Co supported TiO2 catalyst at &#8722;0.80&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Theoretical calculations and operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the energy barriers of C&#8722;N coupling were significantly decreased via K+ mediated intermediate assembly. By applying this strategy to various catalysts, we demonstrate that intermediate assembly at the electrode/electrolyte interface is a universal approach to boost sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy and Ruthenium Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Pairs to Boost the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>

A Ru cluster anchored on oxygen vacancy (VO)&#8208;enriched amorphous/crystalline CeO2 (Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948;) electrocatalyst was designed for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, in which the unique interfacial VO&#8208;Ru Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs facilitated the adsorption of H2O, cleavage of H&#8208;OH bonds and H2 desorption, meanwhile the desorption of OH from VO sites was accelerated via a water&#8208;assisted proton exchange pathway, thus boosting the overall HER kinetics.







Abstract
Simultaneous optimization of the energy level of water dissociation, hydrogen and hydroxide desorption is the key to achieving fast kinetics for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the well&#8208;dispersed Ru clusters on the surface of amorphous/crystalline CeO2&#8208;&#948; (Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948;) is demonstrated to be an excellent electrocatalyst for significantly boosting the alkaline HER kinetics owing to the presence of unique oxygen vacancy (VO) and Ru Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs (LABPs). The representative Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948; exhibits an outstanding mass activity of 7180&#8197;mA&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 that is approximately 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C at the potential of &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (V vs RHE) and an extremely low overpotential of 21.2&#8197;mV at a geometric current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the VO as Lewis acid sites facilitate the adsorption of H2O and cleavage of H&#8208;OH bonds, meanwhile, the weak Lewis basic Ru clusters favor for the hydrogen desorption. Importantly, the desorption of OH from VO sites is accelerated via a water&#8208;assisted proton exchange pathway, and thus boost the kinetics of alkaline HER. This study sheds new light on the design of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts with LABPs for the enhanced alkaline HER.

         <title>Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based Catalysts by Tuning Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust Ni/ZrO2 catalyst with exceptional low&#8208;temperature CO2 methanation performance even at 230&#8201;&#176;C (350&#8201;&#176;C for most of reported catalysts) via tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and electron density of active sites. The potential different reaction mechanisms were well illustrated by experimental analysis.







Abstract
Rational design of low&#8208;cost and efficient transition&#8208;metal catalysts for low&#8208;temperature CO2 activation is significant and poses great challenges. Herein, a strategy via regulating the local electron density of active sites is developed to boost CO2 methanation that normally requires &gt;350&#8201;&#176;C for commercial Ni catalysts. An optimal Ni/ZrO2 catalyst affords an excellent low&#8208;temperature performance hitherto, with a CO2 conversion of 84.0&#8201;%, CH4 selectivity of 98.6&#8201;% even at 230&#8201;&#176;C and GHSV of 12,000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for 106&#8197;h, reflecting one of the best CO2 methanation performance to date on Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Combined a series of in situ spectroscopic characterization studies reveal that re&#8208;constructing monoclinic&#8208;ZrO2 supported Ni species with abundant oxygen vacancies can facilitate CO2 activation, owing to the enhanced local electron density of Ni induced by the strong metal&#8208;support interactions. These findings might be of great aid for construction of robust catalysts with an enhanced performance for CO2 emission abatement and beyond.

         <title>Integrating Host Design and Tailored Electronic Effects of Yolk&#8211;Shell Zn&#8722;Mn Diatomic Sites for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly accessible yolk&#8211;shell structure and tailored electronic effects of the dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalyst (DASC) Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC endow it with excellent performance in the conversion of CO2 into CO in both an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell. Robust interactions with the Zn&#8722;Mn dual site, which shows an ideal adsorption strength for COOH*, effectively decrease the energy barrier of the reaction, thereby enhancing the inherent activity of CO2 reduction on the DASC.







Abstract
Modulating the surface and spatial structure of the host is associated with the reactivity of the active site, and also enhances the mass transfer effect of the CO2 electroreduction process (CO2RR). Herein, we describe the development of two&#8208;step ligand etch&#8211;pyrolysis to access an asymmetric dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalyst (DASC) composed of a yolk&#8211;shell carbon framework (Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC) derived from S,N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8722;Mn dimers anchored on a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC, the electronic effects of the S/N&#8722;Zn&#8722;Mn&#8722;S/N configuration are tailored by strong interactions between Zn&#8722;Mn dual sites and co&#8208;coordination with S/N atoms, rendering structural stability and atomic distribution. In an H&#8208;cell, the Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC DASC shows a low onset overpotential of 50&#8197;mV and high CO Faraday efficiency of 97&#8201;% with a low applied overpotential of 343&#8197;mV, thus outperforming counterparts, and in a flow cell, it also reaches a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V, benefitting from the high structure accessibility and active dual sites. DFT simulations showed that the S,N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8722;Mn diatomic site with optimal adsorption strength of COOH* lowers the reaction energy barrier, thus boosting the intrinsic CO2RR activity on DASC. The structure&#8208;property correlation found in this study suggests new ideas for the development of highly accessible atomic catalysts.

         <dc:description>
A class of non&#8208;covalently stapled H+/Cl&#8722;&#160;ion channels&#160;activatable by visible light is presented by Changliang Ren et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202314666). Photoirradiation of the precursor molecules results in the release of channel&#8208;forming molecules with two different conformations. These molecules self&#8208;assemble into 1D channels, enabling efficient co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722;&#160;across the membrane and yielding a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A class of non-covalently&lt;/b&gt; stapled H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;ion channels&#160;activatable by visible light is presented by Changliang Ren et&#8197;al. in their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202314666"&gt;(e202314666)&lt;/a&gt;. Photoirradiation of the precursor molecules results in the release of channel-forming molecules with two different conformations. These molecules self-assemble into 1D channels, enabling efficient co-transport of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;across the membrane and yielding a 10.5-fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells.

A redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from diaminotriazine&#8208;decorated hexaazatrinaphthalene and used as the cathode material in aqueous zinc ion batteries, as reported by Fengchao Cui, Heng&#8208;Guo Wang, Guangshan Zhu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202314411). The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow the HOF with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, a stable supramolecular structure and enhanced H+ storage.

An azepine ring as an exotic fusing motif in the 21&#8208;carbaselenaporphyrinoid dyads is reported by Anna Berlicka, Lechos&#322;aw Latos&#8208;Gra&#380;y&#324;ski et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202314925). The covalently linked dyads exhibit a unique geometry, characterized by a canted arrangement of two carbaselenaporphyrinic planes. The dimerization process occurs via a [5+2] cycloaddition reaction.

Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metallo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring coordination is reported by Jun Li, Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202313491). The unexpected coordination, which is different from the common organo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination, serves single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered Pd nanoclusters with exceptional stability. Furthermore, the dominant horizontal electron transition induces strong optical absorption and promising photothermal conversion efficiency of the Pd8&#160;nanocluster with well&#8208;defined composition and structure.

         <title>Bifunctional Peptide Nanofibrils for Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimera) method, reported by Zhang et&#8197;al., uses self&#8208;assembling peptides as carriers of POI (protein of interest) and E3 ligase ligands. Cellular nanofibrils built upon the peptide assembly can serve as degradation centers (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) through the formation of polynary POI:Nano&#8208;PROTAC&#8201;:&#8201;E3 complexes. This strategy has the potential to overcome the hook effect of traditional PROTACs.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for ablating undruggable targets. A PROTAC degrader achieves targeted protein degradation (TPD) through the simultaneous binding of a protein of interest (POI) and an E3 ligase to form a ternary complex. A nanofibril&#8208;based PROTAC strategy to form a polynary (E3)m&#8201;:&#8201;PROTAC&#8201;:&#8201;(POI)n complex has not been reported in the TPD field up to this point. A recent innovation shows that a POI ligand and E3 ligase ligand don't have to be within a fused degrader molecule. Instead, they can be recruited to cellular proximity by a self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driving peptide and click chemistry. The resulting nanofibrils can recruit multiple POI and E3 ligase molecules to form a polynary complex as a degradation center. The so&#8208;called Nano&#8208;PROTAC provides a novel approach for TPD in cancer therapy.

         <title>Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol Catalysed by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the opportunities offered by metal&#8211;organic frameworks for the selective gas&#8208;phase CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. Emphasis is provided to illustrate their flexibility in design and synthesis to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes, the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity to determine the activity and selectivity are also discussed.







Abstract
Large scale production of green CH3OH obtained from CO2 and green H2 is a highly wanted process due to the role of CH3OH as H2/energy carrier and for producing chemicals. Starting with a short summary of the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts in liquid&#8208;phase reactions, the present article highlights the opportunities that MOFs may offer also for some gas&#8208;phase reactions, particularly for the selective CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. It is commented that there is a temperature compatibility window that combines the thermal stability of some MOFs with the temperature required in the CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH that frequently ranges from 250 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. The existing literature in this area is briefly organized according to the role of MOF as providing the active sites or as support of active metal nanoparticles (NPs). Emphasis is made to show how the flexibility in design and synthesis of MOFs can be used to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes and the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity, as well as the role that should play theoretical calculations in models have also been highlighted.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Systems for NOx Valorization in Organonitrogen Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic systems for NOx reduction species provide a promising way for synthetic value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds, which not only brings novel insights for handling environmental problems caused by NOx, but also pave a new clue for the development of electrosynthesis, application of water splitting, fixing nitrogen circle and understanding the origins of life to build a sustainable society.







Abstract
Inorganic nitrogen oxide (NOx) species, such as NO, NO2, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722; generated from the decomposition of organic matters, volcanic eruptions and lightning activated nitrogen, play important roles in the nitrogen cycle system and exploring the origin of life. Meanwhile, excessive emission of NOx gases and residues from industry and transportation causes troubling problems to the environment and human health. How to efficiently handle these wastes is a global problem. In response to the growing demand for sustainability, scientists are actively pursuing sustainable electrochemical technologies powered by renewable energy sources and efficient utilization of hydrogen energy to convert NOx species into high&#8208;value organonitrogen chemicals. In this minireview, recent advances of electrocatalytic systems for NOx species valorization in organonitrogen synthesis are classified and described, such as amino acids, amide, urea, oximes, nitrile etc., that have been widely applied in medicine, life science and agriculture. Additionally, the current challenges including multiple side reactions and complicated paths, viable solutions along with future directions ahead in this field are also proposed. The coupling electrocatalytic systems provide a green mode for fixing nitrogen cycle bacteria and bring enlightenment to human sustainable development.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Lewis Pairs in the Assembly of Supramolecular Macrocycles, Molecular Cages, Polymers, and 3D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;nitrogen Lewis pairs (LPs) serve as versatile motifs that not only facilitate self&#8208;assembly but also endow macromolecules with unique characteristics. The dynamic nature of the dative bonding is exploited in the generation of new macrocycles, molecular cages, 1D polymers, and 3D networks with interesting optical and electronic properties, host&#8211;guest characteristics, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;shifting properties.







Abstract
Covering an exceptionally wide range of bond strengths, the dynamic nature and facile tunability of dative B&#8722;N bonds is highly attractive when it comes to the assembly of supramolecular polymers and materials. This Minireview offers an overview of advances in the development of functional materials where Lewis pairs (LPs) play a key role in their assembly and critically influence their properties. Specifically, we describe the reversible assembly of linear polymers with interesting optical, electronic and catalytic properties, discrete macrocycles and molecular cages that take up diverse guest molecules and undergo structural changes triggered by external stimuli, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intriguing interlocked structures that can embed and separate gases such as CO2 and acetylene, and soft polymer networks that serve as recyclable, self&#8208;healing, and responsive thermosets, gels and elastomeric materials.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomers Bearing Multiple Chiral Elements: An Emerging Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements has recently become an emerging research field. Chemists have devised metal&#8208;catalyzed or organocatalytic asymmetric reactions for accessing atropisomers with multiple chiral elements, such as those with center chirality, planar chirality, and helical chirality. This review summarizes the rapid developments in this field and indicated the remaining challenges.







Abstract
With the rapid development of asymmetric catalysis, the demand for the enantioselective synthesis of complex and diverse molecules with different chiral elements is increasing. Owing to the unique features of atropisomerism, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has attracted a considerable interest from the chemical science community. In particular, introducing additional chiral elements, such as carbon centered chirality, heteroatomic chirality, planar chirality, and helical chirality, into atropisomers provides an opportunity to incorporate new properties into axially chiral compounds, thus expanding the potential applications of atropisomers. Thus, it is important to perform catalytic asymmetric transformations to synthesize atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements. In spite of challenges in such transformations, in recent years, chemists have devised powerful strategies under asymmetric organocatalysis or metal catalysis, synthesizing a wide range of enantioenriched atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements. Therefore, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements has become an emerging field. This review summarizes the rapid progress in this field and indicates challenges, thereby promoting this field to a new horizon.

         <title>Cyclic Peptides for Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptides combine a number of favorable properties that make them attractive for drug development. Today, more than 40 therapeutics based on cyclic peptides are in use, and new, powerful technologies for their development suggest that this number could grow rapidly. In this review, we feature cyclic peptide drugs developed in the past, discuss the properties of this molecule class, describe technological advances, and discuss current challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of cyclic peptide therapeutics.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are fascinating molecules abundantly found in nature and exploited as molecular format for drug development as well as other applications, ranging from research tools to food additives. Advances in peptide technologies made over many years through improved methods for synthesis and drug development have resulted in a steady stream of new drugs, with an average of around one cyclic peptide drug approved per year. Powerful technologies for screening random peptide libraries, and de novo generating ligands, have enabled the development of cyclic peptide drugs independent of naturally derived molecules and now offer virtually unlimited development opportunities. In this review, we feature therapeutically relevant cyclic peptides derived from nature and discuss the unique properties of cyclic peptides, the enormous technological advances in peptide ligand development in recent years, and current challenges and opportunities for developing cyclic peptides that address unmet medical needs.

         <dc:description>
While hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regioselective allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization via direct HAA from the allene represents an inherent challenge and remains an unsolved problem. Herein, we report a copper catalyzed allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of several tri&#8208;, di&#8208; and mono&#8208;substituted allenes with exceptional site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
While the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, the radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond via direct HAA from C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of allene remains an unsolved challenge in synthetic chemistry. This is primarily due to inherent challenges with addition of radical intermediates to allenes, regioselectivity of HAA process, instability of allenyl radical toward propargyl radical et&#8197;al. Herein, we report a copper catalyzed allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of an array of tri&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted allenes with exceptional site&#8208;selectivity, while mono&#8208;substituted allene was successfully cyanated, albeit with a low yield. In the developed strategy, steric N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;alkylsulfonamide, serving as precursor of hydrogen atom abstractor, plays a crucial role in achieving the desired regioselectivity and avoiding addition of N&#8208;centered radical to allene.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Proteolysis Targeting Chimera Enables Targeting the Scaffolding Functions of FK506&#8208;Binding Protein 51 (FKBP51)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FK506&#8208;binding site of FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is chemically tractable but not required for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) repression by FKBP51. The proteolysis targeting chimera SelDeg51 enables degradation of FKBP51, abolishes its scaffolding functions, and reactivates GR signaling.







Abstract
The FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a promising target in a variety of disorders including depression, chronic pain, and obesity. Previous FKBP51&#8208;targeting strategies were restricted to occupation of the FK506&#8208;binding site, which does not affect core functions of FKBP51. Here, we report the discovery of the first FKBP51 proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that enables degradation of FKBP51 abolishing its scaffolding function. Initial synthesis of 220 FKBP&#8208;focused PROTACs yielded a plethora of active PROTACs for FKBP12, six for FKBP51, and none for FKBP52. Structural analysis of a binary FKBP12:PROTAC complex revealed the molecular basis for negative cooperativity. Linker&#8208;based optimization of first generation FKBP51 PROTACs led to the PROTAC SelDeg51 with improved cellular activity, selectivity, and high cooperativity. The structure of the ternary FKBP51:SelDeg51:VCB complex revealed how SelDeg51 establishes cooperativity by dimerizing FKBP51 and the von Hippel&#8208;Lindau protein (VHL) in a glue&#8208;like fashion. SelDeg51 efficiently depletes FKBP51 and reactivates glucocorticoid receptor (GR)&#8208;signalling, highlighting the enhanced efficacy of full protein degradation compared to classical FKBP51 binding.

         <title>21&#8208;Carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoid Dyads&#8212;An Azepine Unit as a Merging Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently linked selenacarbaporphyrinic dyads exhibit a unique open seashell architecture. These structures were formed via the [5+2] cycloaddition reaction, creating a unifying azepine motif.







Abstract
The oxidation of 10,15&#8208;diaryl&#8208;21&#8208;carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoids resulted in the creation of dyads. The dimerization process follows a [5+2] cycloaddition path with the formation of an azepine unit. The arrays display two direct bonds between the peripheral carbocyclic carbon atoms of one carbaselenaporphyrinic subunit and the central carbon and nitrogen atoms of the second subunit. This results in a unique canted arrangement of two carbaporphyrinoid planes resembling an open seashell&#8208;like motif.

         <title>Diborodichloromethane as Versatile Reagent for Chemodivergent Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) has been developed. DBDCM serves as a versatile building block for the synthesis of structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM result in various tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. Isotopic enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents are also synthesized.







Abstract
The development of boron reagents is crucial for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a scalable and practical synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) through the reaction of trichloromethyllithium with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The resulting DBDCM reagent serves as a basic synthetic unit for the construction of various structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Moreover, we have developed consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM for the construction of diverse tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. The use of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;chloroform and 10B2pin2 enables the synthesis of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents, which are beneficial for the convenient synthesis of carbon&#8208;13 and boron&#8208;10 molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)Aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One&#8208;Pot Sulfur&#8208;Arylation and Dealkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids is reported. Broad scope and high functional group compatibility were observed including for late&#8208;stage incorporation of sulfenamide functionality in complex drugs and drug precursors. Sulfur&#8208;functionalization then enables the synthesis of diverse, medicinally relevant high oxidation state sulfur pharmacophores.







Abstract
A general one&#8208;pot approach to diverse N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from a common S&#8208;phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8722;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to N&#8208;acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide S&#8208;substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one&#8208;pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8722;S bond formation.

     alt="Synthesis of N-Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)Aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One-Pot Sulfur-Arylation and Dealkylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general one-pot approach for the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylsulfenamides from commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids is reported. Broad scope and high functional group compatibility were observed including for late-stage incorporation of sulfenamide functionality in complex drugs and drug precursors. Sulfur-functionalization then enables the synthesis of diverse, medicinally relevant high oxidation state sulfur pharmacophores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general one-pot approach to diverse &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylsulfenamides from a common &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8722;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one-pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8722;S bond formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Arboduridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid arboduridine has been accomplished. The synthesis features a highly enantioselective Michael addition to establish the vicinal sterically congested quaternary C7 and tertiary C19 stereocenters. The other stereogenic centers in this core unit were installed in a stereospecific and sequential fashion by taking advantage of the conformations of the corresponding precursors.







Abstract
The first asymmetric total synthesis of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid arboduridine has been accomplished. The tricyclic A/B/D ring system was constructed by an enantioselective Michael reaction followed by intramolecular nucleophilic addition. Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;amination of a ketone forged the piperidine ring, while a Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons (HWE) reaction was used to form the pyrrolidine ring. A reduction cyclization cascade led to formation of the tetrahydrofuran ring.

         <title>Subnanometric Bismuth Clusters Confined in Pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 Enable Remarkable CO2 Photoreduction</title>

In situ construction of subnanometric metallic Bi clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 leads to more than a 20&#8208;fold enhancement of photocatalytic CO production from aqueous CO2 solution.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient photocatalysts for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) into chemical fuels is of great importance for energy sustainability and carbon resource utilization. Herein, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method for in situ construction of subnanometric Bi metallic clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 frameworks, leading to the remarkable improvements of photocatalytic performances for CO2 reduction into CO in the absence of sacrificial reagent. More specifically, an outstanding CO evolution activity of 114.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 has been achieved, more than 20&#8208;fold improvement compared with the pristine Bi2Sn2O7 (5.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Detailed experiments together with in situ characterizations reveal that the spatially confined Bi clusters could significantly promote charge&#8208;separation/electron&#8208;enrichment and adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, which provides highly efficient reaction channels to facilitate the generation of *COOH intermediate as well as the subsequent desorption of *CO towards CO formation. These demonstrations provide an important knowledge for precise design and fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion into solar fuels.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Degradation of Ether&#8208;Containing Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidative polymer degradation promoted by molecular oxygen provides an electrocatalytic degradation of polymers with activated C&#8722;H bonds, such as polyethers, poly(vinyl ethers), and polyether&#8208;based polyurethanes. A study of the mechanism, selectivity, and efficiency of this method led to the identification of oxidized small&#8208;molecule degradation products.







Abstract
Leveraging electrochemistry to degrade robust polymeric materials has the potential to impact society's growing issue of plastic waste. Herein, we develop an electrocatalytic oxidative degradation of polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) via electrochemically mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidative polymer degradation promoted by molecular oxygen. We investigated the selectivity and efficiency of this method, finding our conditions to be highly selective for polymers with hydridic, electron&#8208;rich C&#8722;H bonds. We leveraged this reactivity to degrade polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) in the presence of polymethacrylates and polyacrylates with complete selectivity. Furthermore, this method made polyacrylates degradable by incorporation of ether units into the polymer backbone. We quantified degradation products, identifying up to 36&#8197;mol&#8201;% of defined oxidation products, including acetic acid, formic acid, and acetaldehyde, and we extended this method to degrade a polyether&#8208;based polyurethane in a green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile, electrochemically&#8208;driven route to degrade polymers containing ether functionalities.

         <title>Lamellar Crystal Structure and Haldane Magnetism in NH4VPO4OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new compound, NH4VPO4OH, has been synthesized under mild hydrothermal condition. It possesses a lamellar crystal structure and shows a spin gap behavior inherent for the Haldane system. This rare ground state has been supported in the first&#8208;principles calculations.







Abstract
A novel vanadium hydroxide&#8208;phosphate, NH4VPO4OH, was synthesized hydrothermally in V2O5&#8722;NH4H2PO4&#8208;citric acid system at 230&#8201;&#176;C. It was characterized by XRD, TG&#8208;DSC, SEM&#8208;EDX, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. NH4VPO4OH is isostructural with NH4GaPO4OH and features edge&#8208;sharing chains of VO6 octahedra. These chains running along [010] direction of the unit cell are connected by phosphate tetrahedra to form infinite layers parallel to the (100) plane. Ammonium cations are embedded between the heteropolyhedral layers. According to the thermodynamic and NMR measurements supported by the first&#8208;principles calculations, NH4VPO4OH presents a rare case of Haldane spin system with spin S=1 based on V3+ ions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective synthesis of macrocyclic planar&#8208;chiral indoles via NHC&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular macrocyclization is reported. In addition, the indole&#8208;based macrocycles bearing both planar and axial chirality have also been constructed via kinetic resolution. Importantly, these obtained planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles provide additional possibilities to develop novel catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.







Abstract
Indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles are widely found in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, in sharp contrast to the preparation of indole&#8208;based axially chiral structures, the enantioselective catalysis of indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles is still a formidable task so far. Here we report an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective macrocyclization of 3&#8208;carboxaldehyde indole/pyrroles, featuring with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and allowing for a rapid access to diverse indole/pyrrole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles with various tether&#8208;lengths (10&#8211;16 members) in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, the indole&#8208;based macrocyclic structures with both planar and axial chirality were directly and efficiently obtained through this protocol with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. In addition, these synthesized planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles offer many possibilities for chemists to develop new catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.

         <title>Breaking the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Ru Symmetry of a RuO2 Catalyst for Sustainable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In active structure exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance for acid oxygen evolution reaction, which is significantly enhanced by the contracted Ru&#8722;O bond compared to RuO2.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a highly promising hydrogen production technique for sustainable energy supply, however, achieving a highly active and durable catalyst for acidic water oxidation still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a local microenvironment regulation strategy for precisely tuning In&#8722;RuO2/graphene (In&#8722;RuO2/G) catalyst with intrinsic electrochemical activity and stability to boost acidic water oxidation. The In&#8722;RuO2/G displays robust acid oxygen evolution reaction performance with a mass activity of 671&#8197;A gcat&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V, an overpotential of 187&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;lasting stability of 350&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which arises from the asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In local structure interactions. Further, it is unraveled theoretically that the asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In structure breaks the thermodynamic activity limit of the traditional adsorption evolution mechanism which significantly weakens the formation energy barrier of OOH*, thus inducing a new rate&#8208;determining step of OH* absorption. Therefore, this strategy showcases the immense potential for constructing high&#8208;performance acidic catalysts for water electrolyzers.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Hydrogen: Pushing the Limit of Multicentre Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom has been predicted for the first time in the global minimum D4h geometry of In4H+ cluster.







Abstract
Among the list of planar tetracoordinate atoms, the smallest element hydrogen is missing. No experimental and theoretical evidence have ever been put forwarded. Herein, we introduce the first planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom (ptH) in the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is acting like a proton and significant charge transfer from the surrounding In4 framework results in a negative charge of the central hydrogen atom. The proposed global minimum geometry possesses &#963;&#8208;aromaticity and the central hydrogen atom forms unusual multicentre bond with more than three centres.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Prof. Judy&#8197;I. Wu, Department of Chemistry, University of Houston (USA) and Prof. Michael M.

The X&#8208;ray structure of tetra&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene was reported in 1986 to possess a symmetric, delocalized D2h geometry, which went against conventional wisdom that this antiaromatic should exhibit a bond&#8208;localized C2h structure. Computational studies over the ensuing 35+ years yielded conflicting outcomes as to the preferred geometry.
