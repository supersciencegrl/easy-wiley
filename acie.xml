         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. However, fabricating soft and stimuli responsive materials with a defined mechanism to tune and precisely control the triggered response has been considerably challenging. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (  PVDF  ) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (  Oba&#8208;cage  ) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. Interestingly, 50 wt% of the  Oba&#8208;cage  in the polymer matrix (i. e. 1:1 weight ratio) shows a very fast and reversible vapor triggered stretching and bending in less than 2 seconds. The adsorption and desorption of the organic vapors (tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and ethyl acetate) by the  Oba&#8208;cage_50@PVDF  film can be repeated many times with no noticeable loss in performance. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Dynamic Polymer Networks Enabled by Woven Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crosslinking plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties of polymer materials. Although various crosslinks based on covalent or noncovalent bonds have been adopted, it remains an enormous challenge to develop a crosslink which could endow corresponding polymer network with robust yet dynamic properties. Herein, we report a crosslink simultaneously having dynamic property and woven geometry, and the polymer network with woven crosslinks (WPN) could integrate the merits of covalent polymer network (CPN) and supramolecular polymer network (SPN). In specific, the WPN not only exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of CPN, but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity and ductility, similar to those of SPN. Particularly, its toughness and puncture resistance are much superior to those of the others. Besides, the dynamicity of woven crosslink also imparts good performances of self&#8208;healing and processability to WPN.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;responsive Tubular Conjugated Polymer 2D Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creation of new 2D architectures has attracted significant attention in the field of self&#8208;assembly for structural diversity and new functionalization. Although numerous 2D polymer nanosheets have been reported, 2D nanosheets with tubular channels have been unexplored. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the fabrication of stimulus&#8208;responsive conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with hollow cavities. Amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes self&#8208;assembled in an aqueous solution in a columnar manner to afford bilayered 2D nanosheets with intrinsically tubular nanochannels. UV&#8208;induced polymerization resulted in the generation of blue&#8208;colored tubular conjugated polydiacetylene 2D nanosheets. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling with FRET phenomenon and colorimetric DNA sensing were demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets. In addition, the free NH  2  containing polymerized 2D nanosheet was utilized for conductivity behavior and grafting on graphene oxide (GO)</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Separation of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1 upon Specific RNA&#8208;Binding Observed by Magnetic Resonance
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble model of free dispersed full&#8208;length heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) was generated from magnetic resonance data based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling and from a small&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray scattering curve. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with this model provides insight into the interplay of specific single&#8208;stranded RNA recognition by hnRNP A1 and its liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation.







Abstract
Interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with specific single&#8208;stranded RNA and its relation to liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) were studied in vitro by magnetic resonance based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling. An ensemble model of dispersed hnRNP A1 in the absence of RNA was derived from distance distributions between spin labelled sites and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This model revealed a compact state of the low&#8208;complexity domain and its interaction with the RNA recognition motifs. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy confirmed this interaction. Addition of RNA to dispersed hnRNP A1 induced liquid&#8208;droplet formation. Such LLPS depended on RNA concentration and sequence, with continuous wave EPR spectroscopy showing an influence of RNA point mutations on local protein dynamics. We propose that an interplay of sequence&#8208;specific RNA binding and LLPS contributes to regulation of specific RNA segregation during stress response.

         <title>Facile Access to Far&#8208;Red Fluorescent Probes with Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Effects for In Vivo Two&#8208;Photon Microscopy of the Mouse Cerebrovascular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes formed between aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) acceptors and arylamine donors showed through&#8208;space charge transfer as well as a &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interaction between the acceptor and the donor. Owing to these properties, the complexes served as far&#8208;red fluorescent nanoprobes with two&#8208;photon excitation. The probe was applied to in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.







Abstract
Much effort has been devoted to the generation of fluorescent probes by synthetic approaches. In this study, we developed a facile strategy to construct far&#8208;red fluorescent probes based on through&#8208;space charge transfer within complexes of acceptors and donors and their &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interactions. Owing to their rare two&#8208;photon excitation property, the complexes could be used for in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.

         <title>Novel Poxin Stable cGAMP&#8208;Derivatives Are Remarkable STING Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dideoxy&#8208;cyclic&#8208;dinucleotide analogs of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP are prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. The dideoxy analogs are found to exhibit remarkable in cellulo and in vitro properties, are stable against degradation by poxvirus immune nucleases, and exhibit superior tumor growth control in a mouse model.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP is a cyclic A&#8208; and G&#8208;containing dinucleotide second messenger, which is formed upon cellular recognition of foreign cytosolic DNA as part of the innate immune response. The molecule binds to the adaptor protein STING, which induces an immune response characterized by the production of type I interferons and cytokines. The development of STING&#8208;binding molecules with both agonistic as well as antagonistic properties is currently of tremendous interest to induce or enhance antitumor or antiviral immunity on the one hand, or to treat autoimmune diseases on the other hand. To escape the host innate immune recognition, some viruses encode poxin endonucleases that cleave 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP. Here we report that dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP (1) and analogs thereof, which lack the secondary ribose&#8208;OH groups, form a group of poxin&#8208;stable STING agonists. Despite their reduced affinity to STING, particularly the compound constructed from two A nucleosides, dideoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cAAMP (2), features an unusually high antitumor response in mice.

     alt="Novel Poxin Stable cGAMP-Derivatives Are Remarkable STING Agonists"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dideoxy-cyclic-dinucleotide analogs of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;-cGAMP are prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. The dideoxy analogs are found to exhibit remarkable in cellulo and in vitro properties, are stable against degradation by poxvirus immune nucleases, and exhibit superior tumor growth control in a mouse model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&#8242;,3&#8242;-cGAMP is a cyclic A- and G-containing dinucleotide second messenger, which is formed upon cellular recognition of foreign cytosolic DNA as part of the innate immune response. The molecule binds to the adaptor protein STING, which induces an immune response characterized by the production of type I interferons and cytokines. The development of STING-binding molecules with both agonistic as well as antagonistic properties is currently of tremendous interest to induce or enhance antitumor or antiviral immunity on the one hand, or to treat autoimmune diseases on the other hand. To escape the host innate immune recognition, some viruses encode poxin endonucleases that cleave 2&#8242;,3&#8242;-cGAMP. Here we report that dideoxy-2&#8242;,3&#8242;-cGAMP (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and analogs thereof, which lack the secondary ribose-OH groups, form a group of poxin-stable STING agonists. Despite their reduced affinity to STING, particularly the compound constructed from two A nucleosides, dideoxy-2&#8242;,3&#8242;-cAAMP (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), features an unusually high antitumor response in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of a Strong Heterogeneous Aluminum Lewis Acid on Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al(OC(CF3)3)3(PhF) reacts with partially dehydroxylated silica to form very strong Lewis acid sites. The well&#8208;defined aluminum Lewis acids are significantly stronger than common molecular Lewis acids and engage in alkyl abstraction reactions that are uncommon using well&#8208;defined supported Lewis acids.







Abstract
Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) reacts with silanols present on partially dehydroxylated silica to form well&#8208;defined &#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(O(Si&#8801;)2) (1). 27Al&#8197;NMR and DFT calculations with a small cluster model to approximate the silica surface show that the aluminum in 1 adopts a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry by coordinating to a nearby siloxane bridge and a fluorine from the alkoxide. Fluoride ion affinity (FIA) calculations follow experimental trends and show that 1 is a stronger Lewis acid than B(C6F5)3 and Al(OC(CF3)3)(PhF) but is weaker than Al(OC(CF3)3) and iPr3Si+. Cp2Zr(CH3)2 reacts with 1 to form [Cp2ZrCH3][&#8801;SiOAl(OC(CF3)3)2(CH3)] (3) by methide abstraction. This reactivity pattern is similar to reactions of organometallics with the proposed strong Lewis acid sites present on Al2O3.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Antimony&#8208;Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antitumor Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel soluble and water&#8208;stable giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) has been developed, which shows the largest Sb&#8722;Ln&#8722;W cluster and has the greatest number of Sb centers in a cluster yet found in POM chemistry. Importantly, the Sb&#8208;rich POM can exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor and anti&#8208;metastatic activities in vitro and in vivo without causing adverse effects, making it a promising candidate for a antitumor agent.







Abstract
Herein, a giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb21Tb7W56} is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb&#8208;rich POM has many interesting structural features and is a rare example of a soluble and water&#8208;stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb&#8208;rich POM exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53&#8208;dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb&#8208;rich POM was capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of a breast cancer in vivo. This work demonstrates that Sb&#8208;rich POMs are promising candidates for the development of new anticancer drugs.

         <title>Electrochemically Initiated Synthesis of Methanesulfonic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methanesulfonic acid was achieved from only methane and oleum in an electrochemical reactor. At the boron&#8208;doped diamond anode the species is formed, which initiates the catalytic cycle where methane is selectively sulfonated to the product. A concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) was achieved at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The direct sulfonation of methane to methanesulfonic acid was achieved in an electrochemical reactor without adding peroxide initiators. The synthesis proceeds only from oleum and methane. This is possible due to in situ formation of an initiating species from the electrolyte at a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode. Elevated pressure, moderate temperature and suitable current density are beneficial to reach high concentration at outstanding selectivity. The highest concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) at 97&#8201;% selectivity was reached with a stepped electric current program at 6.25&#8211;12.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours. We present a novel, electrochemical method to produce methanesulfonic acid, propose a reaction mechanism and show general dependencies between parameters and yields for methanesulfonic acid.

         <title>Central Unit Fluorination of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CH molecules with newly modification site on central unit of Y&#8208;series electron acceptors has been designed and synthesized to afford better&#8208;performed organic solar cells (OSCs). Further fluorination on the largely unexplored central unit enabled significantly improved photovoltaic performance with over 18% efficiency for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs..







Abstract
Halogenation of terminal of acceptors has been shown to give dramatic improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Similar significant results could be expected from the halogenation of the central units of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Y&#8208;series acceptors. Herein, a pair of acceptors, termed CH6 and CH4, featuring a conjugation&#8208;extended phenazine central unit with and without fluorination, have been synthesized. The fluorinated CH6 has enhanced molecular interactions and crystallinity, superior fibrillar network morphology and improved charge generation and transport in blend films, thus affording a higher PCE of 18.33&#8201;% for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs compared to 16.49&#8201;% for the non&#8208;fluorinated CH4. The new central site offers further opportunities for structural optimization of Y&#8208;series molecules to afford better&#8208;performed OSCs and reveals the effectiveness of fluorination on central units.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Nonpolar Pore Surfaces for the One&#8208;Step Acquisition of C2H4 from a C2H4 and C2H6 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;organic framework FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) which has nonpolar pore surfaces can directly give polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures at different gas flow rates, temperatures, and relative humidity. This separation is possible because it adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K.







Abstract
Because C2H4 plays an essential role in the chemical industry, economical and energy&#8208;efficient separation of ethylene (C2H4) from ethane (C2H6) is extremely important. With the exception of energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation, there are few one&#8208;step methods to obtain polymer&#8208;grade (&#8805;99.95&#8201;% pure) C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures. Here we report a highly stable metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) (FJI&#8208;H=Hong's group in Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter) which features one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal nonpolar pore surfaces constructed by aromatic rings and alkyl groups. This FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K. Practical breakthrough experiments with C2H4 containing 1&#8201;% C2H6 have shown that FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) can realize the acquisition in one&#8208;step of polymer&#8208;grade, 99.95&#8201;% pure C2H4 under various conditions including different gas flow rates, temperatures and relative humidity.

         <title>Bright and Photostable Fluorescent Metal Nanocluster Supraparticles from Invert Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are formed by drying the water droplets in invert emulsions, resulting in a profoundly enhanced photoluminescence emission and resistance to photobleaching. The supraparticle structure greatly enhances the performance, where the inhibition of the twisted intermolecular charge transfer is one of the responsible causes.







Abstract
Fluorescent supraparticles of gold, silver and copper nanoclusters are synthesized by simply drying of invert emulsions, resulting in a dozen&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (up to &#8776;80&#8201;%) and a significant improvement in photostability. The inhibition of the ligand twisting during the intramolecular charge transfer is found to be responsible for the enhancement, especially for the gold nanocluster supraparticles. This research provides a general, flexible, and easy method for producing highly luminescent and photostable metal nanocluster&#8208;based materials that promise practical applications in white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nitric Oxide for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (Fe SAC) is developed for high&#8208;efficient and controlled generation of nitric oxide (NO). The effectiveness of NO generation system underscores a great promise to expedite NO research in both therapeutic and mechanistic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) constitutes one of the most versatile therapeutics for biomedical applications. The efficient and on&#8208;demand NO generation essentially dictates its concentration dependent therapeutic activity. Here, we report an electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (i.e., Fe SAC), for high&#8208;efficient and controlled NO generation. The Fe SAC shows superior catalytic ability in electrochemical reduction of nitrite, with maximal NO generation rate achieving 2.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;(min&#8201;&#956;g)&#8722;1. Theoretical studies suggest the significant decrease of Gibbs&#8208;free energy of NO2&#8722; adsorption on single&#8208;iron atom accounts for its high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, ample amount of NO can be controllably generated in a potential dependent manner. For antibacterial application, the generated NO overwhelmingly disrupts both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive strains, highlighting a great promise to expedite NO research in both basic and applied sciences.

Enter stereogradient PLA: A tripodal zirconium complex catalyzes the polymerization of L&#8208;lactide contaminated with meso&#8208;lactide to yield stereogradient poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as described by Moshe Kol et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207652). The stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers derived from tin octanoate, and may alleviate the need for L&#8208;lactide purification.

         <title>Excited State Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes Enable Fluorescence Color Changes in a Supramolecular Cyclophane Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclophane&#8208;based supramolecular mechanophore is developed. The mechanophore exhibits charge&#8208;transfer complex emission in the force&#8208;free state and exhibits monomer emission upon application of mechanical force due to spatial separation of the luminophore and quencher. Polyurethane elastomer films in which the mechanophore is covalently embedded exhibit instantly reversible emission color change. The emission change is correlated with the applied stress.







Abstract
Mechanochromic mechanophores are reporter molecules that indicate mechanical events through changes of their photophysical properties. Supramolecular mechanophores in which the activation is based on the rearrangement of luminophores and/or quenchers without any covalent bond scission, remain less well investigated. Here, we report a cyclophane&#8208;based supramolecular mechanophore that contains a 1,6&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophore and a pyromellitic diimide quencher. In solution, the blue monomer emission of the luminophore is largely quenched and a faint reddish&#8208;orange emission originating from a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex is observed. A polyurethane elastomer containing the mechanophore displays orange emission in the absence of force, which is dominated by the CT&#8208;emission. Mechanical deformation causes a decrease of the CT&#8208;emission and an increase of blue monomer emission, due to the spatial separation between the luminophore and quencher. The ratio of the two emission intensities correlates with the applied stress.

&lt;p&gt;A new cyclophane-based supramolecular mechanophore is developed. The mechanophore exhibits charge-transfer complex emission in the force-free state and exhibits monomer emission upon application of mechanical force due to spatial separation of the luminophore and quencher. Polyurethane elastomer films in which the mechanophore is covalently embedded exhibit instantly reversible emission color change. The emission change is correlated with the applied stress.

         <title>Enantioselective Biocascade Catalysis with a Single Multifunctional Enzyme&#160;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes are powerful since they offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a reaction sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocatalytic cascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamine and iminium ion intermediates and combine these mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes bearing multiple stereogenic centers. The multifunctional 4&#8208;OT enzymes could successfully promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanistic features and activation sequences. This study demonstrates that biocatalytic strategies can match and even surpass in efficiency the potential of organocatalytic cascade catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interaction of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Germanium Bromide Perovskites with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ge&#8208;based hybrid perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) due to the geometry and lone&#8208;pair induced non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Here, we report a new family of hybrid three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites  A  GeBr  3  ,  A  = CH  3  NH  3  (MA), CH(NH  2  )  2  (FA), Cs and FAGe  0.5  Sn  0.5  Br  3  , crystallizing in polar space groups. These compounds exhibit tunable SHG responses, where MAGeBr  3  shows the strongest SHG intensity (5 &#215; Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate, KDP). Structural and theoretical analysis indicate the high SHG efficiency is attributed to the displacement of Ge  2+  and preferable alignment of polar MA  +  cations along the [111] direction. This work provides new structural insights for designing and fine&#8208;tuning the SHG properties in hybrid metal halide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Diatomic Pd&#8208;Cu Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Sites for Complete N&#8801;N Bond Formation in Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high&#8208;density PdCu dual&#8208;atom to form a unique PdCuP  4  coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3% NO  3  &#8722;  removal rate and 95.2% N  2  selectivity. In&#8208;situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual&#8208;atom form covalent&#8208;like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual&#8208;atom promotes the breaking of N&#8208;O bond, and the short bond distance of ~ 3&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO  2  &#8722;  , and eventually the two Pd&#8208;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Periodically Interrupting Bonding Behavior to Reformat Delocalized Electronic States of Graphdiyne for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#1087; electron configuration plays a pivotal role in metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, and its delocalization degree overwhelmingly dominates catalytic activity. However, precise and targeted regulation of inherent &#960; electrons still remain challenging. Here, one chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy is proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY) as a concept&#8208;of&#8208;proof. The delocalized electrons are expected to be periodically reformatted for substantially enhancing &#960; electron delocalization. Via theoretical screening and well&#8208;designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8208;Csp2 bonds in GDY can render sp&#8208;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top&#8208;ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as&#8208;proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal&#8208;free catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluoroallyl Sulfonium Salts: Practical and Bench&#8208;Stable Reagents for Highly Regioselective gem&#8208;Difluoroallylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective introduction of the difluoromethylene group into organic molecules has important applications in producing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the general and efficient methods that can construct both C(sp2)&#8208;CF2R and C(sp3)&#8208;CF2R bonds remain challenging. Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench&#8208;stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench-stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3-difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3-trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective gem-difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Atom Ru Monolithic Electrode for Efficient Chlorine Evolution and Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating single&#8208;atom electrodes via atomic dispersion of active metal atoms into monolithic metal supports is of great significance to advancing the lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation of the electrochemical technologies. Here, we report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to fasten ligand&#8208;free isolated Ru atoms on the amorphous layer of monolithic Ti support by regulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution activity, three orders of magnitude higher mass activity than that of commercial dimensionally stable anode, and also selectively reduced nitrate to ammonia with an unprecedented ammonia yield rate of 22.2 mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  at &#8722;0.3 V. Furthermore, the Ru single atom monolithic electrode can be scaled up from 2 &#215; 2 cm to 25 &#215; 15 cm at least, thus demonstrating great potential for industrial electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, Molecular Recognition and Chirality Sensing of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Naphthotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic hosts with a well&#8208;defined cavity are particularly appealing for supramolecular chemistry, but they are still rare. In this research, we reported a new class of macrocyclic hosts, namely methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes, with well&#8208;defined cavities. They were synthesized through TFA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions between alkoxy&#8208;substituted bisnaphthalenes and paraformaldehyde. A configurational selection was observed. Three&#8208;membered macrocycles possess a single cavity, while four&#8208;membered macrocycles adopt a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. The small homologue shows quite strong binding affinities (up to 108 M&#8208;1) to organic cations, which is better than structurally similar but flexible macrocycles. This demonstrates the advantage of a well&#8208;defined cavity in molecular recognition. Moreover, these naphthotubes can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations through different chirality transfer mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Accuracy of Modelling CO2 Electroreduction on Copper Using Many&#8208;Body Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body perturbation theory within its random phase approximation is used to investigate the mechanism of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction on the Cu(100) facet, with special focus on the C&#8722;C coupling step. The formation of *OCCHO is proposed as the potential determining step, yielding onset potential and pH dependence matching well with experiments. RPA results also suggest that defective and stepped surfaces may be essential to understand the observed activity of Cu electrocatalysts for C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) remains the most important metal catalyst for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) into C2 products. Due to limited evidence from in situ experiments, mechanistic studies are often performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT), using functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level, which have fundamental difficulties to correctly describe CO adsorption and surface stability. We employ the adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem within the random phase approximation (RPA), in combination with the linearized Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation to describe solvation effects, to investigate the mechanism of CO2RR on the Cu(100) facet. Qualitatively different from the DFT&#8208;GGA results, RPA results propose the formation of *OCCHO as the potential determining step towards C2 products. The results suggest that it is important to use more accurate methods like RPA when modeling reactions involving multiple CO&#8208;related species like CO2RR.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Electrode Potential of a Working Anode in Dictating the Structural Evolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of electrode potential and anode material, two critical properties of a working anode, in dictating the structural evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was investigated theoretically and experimentally, which provides rational guidance to regulate SEI structure.







Abstract
The performance of rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries is highly correlated with the structure of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The properties of a working anode are vital factors in determining the structure of SEI; however, the correspondingly poor understanding hinders the rational regulation of SEI. Herein, the electrode potential and anode material, two critical properties of an anode, in dictating the structural evolution of SEI were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The anode potential is identified as a crucial role in dictating the SEI structure. The anode potential determines the reduction products in the electrolyte, ultimately giving rise to the mosaic and bilayer SEI structure at high and low potential, respectively. In contrast, the anode material does not cause a significant change in the SEI structure. This work discloses the crucial role of electrode potential in dictating SEI structure and provides rational guidance to regulate SEI structure.

         <title>Synthesis of a Hexachloro Sulfate(IV) Dianion Enabled by Polychloride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first preparation and structural characterization of the hexachlorosulfate dianion, [NEt3Me]2[SCl6], is achieved. This synthesis is enabled by the Janus&#8208;faced trichloride reagent [NEt3Me][Cl3]. While the trichloride [Cl3]&#8722; is chlorinating and oxidizing elemental sulfur, the unique [NEt3Me]+ cation is stabilizing the unprecedented [SCl6]2&#8722; dianion.







Abstract
The preparation and structural characterization of [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] is described, which is the first example of a [SCl6]2&#8722; dianion and of a halosulfate anion of the type [SxXy]z&#8722; in general. This dianion belongs to the group of 14&#8208;valence electron AB6E systems and forms an octahedral structure in the solid&#8208;state. Interestingly, co&#8208;crystallization with CH2Cl2 affords [NEt3Me]2[SCl6]&#8901;4&#8201;CH2Cl2 containing [SCl6]2&#8722; dianions with C4v symmetry. As suggested by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the distortion of the structure is not caused by a stereochemically active lone pair but by enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions with CH2Cl2. At elevated temperatures, [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] decomposes to various sulfur chlorine compounds as shown by Raman spectroscopy. Cooling back to room temperature results in the selective formation of [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] which is comparable to the well&#8208;studied SCl4.

While the trichloride [Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is chlorinating and oxidizing elemental sulfur, the unique [NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Me]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is stabilizing the unprecedented [SCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation and structural characterization of [NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Me]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[SCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is described, which is the first example of a [SCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion and of a halosulfate anion of the type [S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in general. This dianion belongs to the group of 14-valence electron AB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;E systems and forms an octahedral structure in the solid-state. Interestingly, co-crystallization with CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affords [NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Me]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[SCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;4&#8201;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; containing [SCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianions with &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. As suggested by quantum-chemical calculations, the distortion of the structure is not caused by a stereochemically active lone pair but by enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions with CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. At elevated temperatures, [NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Me]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[SCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] decomposes to various sulfur chlorine compounds as shown by Raman spectroscopy. Cooling back to room temperature results in the selective formation of [NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Me]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[SCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] which is comparable to the well-studied SCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two imine&#8208;based COFs, TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF and TPB&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF, were constructed.

Abstract
Two imine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalysts with different building units, TPB&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF and TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF, for photo&#8208;induced energy transfer reversible complexation&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (PET&#8208;RCMP) were developed and investigated, producing ideal polymers with accurate molecular weight and moderate dispersity under visible light irradiation. The chain extension and spatiotemporal control experiments revealed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of polymers and the compatibility of RCMP processes in both bulk and aqueous system. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that heteroatom&#8208;doped TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibits higher activities for weakening C&#8722;I bond energy barrier, which promotes PET&#8208;RCMP polymerization performance. This work demonstrates that rational adjustment of building block for constructing COF heterogeneous photocatalyst can enhance the catalytic performance of PET&#8208;RCMP, providing a design methodology for the development of polymeric organic photoelectric semiconductor catalysts to mediate RCMP.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [2+1] and [4+1] Annulations of Diynes with Ketones via Carbonyl Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal [2+1] and [4+1] annulations of diynes with ketones via carbonyl ylides is disclosed. This protocol enables the divergent, practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of chiral oxiranes and dihydrofurans in moderate to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Carbonyl ylides have proven to be powerful synthons for the efficient construction of various valuable O&#8208;heterocycles, and the formation of carbonyl ylides by the reaction of metal carbenes with carbonyls has attracted increasing attention over the past decades. However, a catalyst&#8208;controlled highly enantioselective reaction of carbonyl ylides from metal carbenes is extremely challenging. Herein, we report a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal [2+1] and [4+1] annulations of diynes with ketones via carbonyl ylides. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first example of successful asymmetric epoxidation via carbonyl ylides, but also constitutes the first reaction of vinyl cations with carbonyl compounds. This method leads to the divergent, practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of chiral oxiranes and dihydrofurans in moderate to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via remote&#8208;stereocontrol strategy.

         <title>Management of Donor and Acceptor Building Blocks in Dopant&#8208;Free Polymer Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer design strategy was proposed by managing the donor and acceptor building blocks with longitudinal extended conjugation for dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs). The optimized device based on the polymer HTM constructed by longitudinal extended BDT&#8208;T and BDD units shows a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.04&#8201;% and greatly improved operational stability.







Abstract
The dominant hole transport material (HTM) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which needs to be doped using hydrophilic dopants to improve its hole mobility and conductivity, resulting in inferior device stability. Here, we propose an effective molecular design strategy to construct dopant&#8208;free polymer HTMs by selecting four structurally related polymers and investigating their structure&#8211;property relationship. It is found that the donor and acceptor units with longitudinal conjugate extension, such as BDT&#8208;T and BDD, could not only enhance the planarity of the conjugated polymer backbone and tune the energy levels but also promote the face&#8208;on orientation, resulting in superior charge extraction and transport. The optimized device utilizing dopant&#8208;free polymer HTM shows a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V and a champion efficiency of 24.04&#8201;% with greatly improved operational stability, making it among the best performance PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Salt&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Reinforced Carbonate Electrolyte for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability of carbonate electrolyte with metallic Li greatly limits its application in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Here, a "salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt" strategy is applied to boost the LiNO3 solubility in the carbonate electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 carrier, which enables the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for excellent Li metal anode performance and also maintains the cathode stability. In the designed electrolyte, both NO3&#8208; and PF6&#8208; anions participate in the Li+&#8208;solvent complexes, thus promoting the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Our designed electrolyte has achieved a superior Li CE of 99.7 %, enabling the high&#8208;loading NCM811||Li (4.5 mAh cm&#8208;2) full cell with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6% capacity retention after 200 cycles. The enhancement of LiNO3 solubility by divalent salts is universal, which will also inspire the electrolyte design for other metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Electrophilic Sulfenylation of N&#8208;Aryl Aminoquinone Derivatives Catalyzed by Chiral SPINOL&#8208;Derived Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives has been achieved for the first time. This transformation is enabled by a new chiral 6,6&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide catalyst, which was first synthesized and then successfully explored for catalyzing enantioselective reactions. Various axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. A class of relatively flexible stereogenic C&#8722;N axes was easily constructed. The experimental results and a computational study suggested that an intramolecular N&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;S hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Density functional theory calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity and underscored the importance of catalyst rigidity in this sulfenylation reaction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N-aryl aminoquinone derivatives has been achieved for the first time. This transformation is enabled by a new chiral 6,6&#8242;-disubstituted SPINOL-derived sulfide catalyst, which was first synthesized and then successfully explored for catalyzing enantioselective reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A broadly applicable diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers is reported herein. Using a copper(II)&#8208;BOX catalytic system, bridged bicyclic lactones are obtained in very high yields (up to 99% yield) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) from diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers. Mechanistic experiments as well as DFT calculations indicate the occurrence of a stepwise mechanism. The synthetic potential of the bridged bicyclic lactones is showcased by the enantioselective synthesis of polyfunctional cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes, as well as a carbasugar unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos: Highly Advantageous Properties as Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A survey of heterocyclic hemithioindigo photoswitches is presented identifying a number of structural motives with outstanding property profiles. The highly sought&#8208;after combination of pronounced color change, quantitative switching in both directions, exceptional high quantum yields, and tunable high thermal stability of metastable states can be realized with 4&#8208;imidazole, 2&#8208;pyrrole, and 3&#8208;indole&#8208;based derivatives. In the former, an unusual preorganization using isomer selective chalcogen&#8208; and hydrogen bonding allows to precisely control geometry changes and tautomerism upon switching. Heterocyclic hemithioindigos thus represent highly promising photoswitches with advanced capabilities that will be of great value to anyone interested in establishing defined and reversible control at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Confinement Hydrogel Network Enables Continuously Regenerative Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft matter catalyst system allowing controllable manipulation of the organized nanostructure and surface property holds the potential for renewable energy. Here we demonstrate the construction of a continuously regenerative hydrogel photocatalyst that confines the metal&#8208;thiolate coordination induced nanocavity into robust micro&#8208;sized spongy network for water splitting. Thanks to low vaporization enthalpy and fast proton mobility of water molecules confining in nanocavities, the composite delivers outstanding photocatalytic H  2  production (TOF of 4568 H2  h&#8208;1  ), nearly 4.5 times higher than that on the catalyst without confinements. Incorporating with conductive polymers, the TOF is substantially improved to 7819 H2  h&#8208;1  . Impressively, continuous regeneration is for the first time achieved with H2  production retention improved from 24% to 72% by regulating optically&#8208;active catalyst surfaces. This optical regeneration method provides new avenues for sustainable solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymers (RHPs)&#8208;derived artificial ion channels were fabricated by a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization method, which simultaneously revealed high K  +  selectivity and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors. The benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moieties appended on lateral chains of RHPs can form ion&#8208;permeable nanopores and transport K  +  over Na  +  through the lipid bilayers. The ion permeation selectivity was significantly enhanced by incorporating a cholesterol group to serve as a membrane anchor. Interestingly, similar to natural gated protein channels, on&#8211;off switchable characteristics were also realized by integrating an additional acid&#8208;sensitive alkylamine group into the RHP&#8208;derived channel. The unique design strategies have endowed the RHP&#8208;derived ion channels with facile synthetic procedures, desirable membrane compatibility, high K  +  selectivity, and tunable pH&#8208;gated properties. This work provides an entry point for future design of novel functional nanochannels.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Coupling Ru Single Atoms to PtNi Concavities for High Performance Methanol Oxidation via d&#8208;Band Center Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom tailored metal nanoparticles represent a new type of catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a single atom&#8208;cavity coupling strategy to regulate performance of single atom tailored nano&#8208;catalysts. Selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) was conducted to deposit Ru single atoms on the surface concavities of PtNi nanoparticles (Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi). Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi exhibits a record&#8208;high activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with 2.01 A mg  &#8208;1  Pt  . Also, Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi showcases a significant durability with only 16% activity loss. Operando electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations demonstrate Ru single atoms coupled to cavities accelerate the CO removal by regulating  d  &#8208;band centre position. Further, the high diffusion barrier of Ru single atoms in concavities accounts for excellent stability. The developed Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi via single atom&#8208;cavity coupling opens an encouraging pathway to design highly efficient single atom&#8208;based (electro)catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Phase Transitions on Diffusive Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase transitions of lipid bilayer membranes should affect passive transport of molecules. While this hypothesis has been used to design drug&#8208;releasing thermosensitive liposomes, the effect has yet to be quantified. Herein, we use time&#8208;resolved second harmonic light scattering to measure transport of a molecular cation across membranes of unilamellar liposomes composed of the total lipid extract of E. coli from 9&#186;C to 36&#186;C, in which two distinct phase transitions (gel to liquid&#8208;disordered phase) have been identified. While the transport rate slowly increases with temperature as a diffusion process, dramatic jumps are observed at 14.7&#186;C and 27.6&#186;C, the known phase transitions. The transport rate constant measured as (7.3&#177;0.8)&#215;10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1 in the liquid&#8208;disordered phase at 36&#186;C is 35&#8208;times faster than (2.1&#177;0.2)&#215;10&#8208;4 s&#8208;1 of the gel phase at 9&#186;C. For the mixed&#8208;phase between these two phases, the measured rates are consistent with a structure of gel domains among a liquid&#8208;disordered bulk.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metal Clusters on 2D Ordered Mesoporous TiO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy is presented for the synthesis of fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO  2  (SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO  2  ) nanosheets. This synthesis features the introduction of the sulfhydryl group in monomicelles to finely realize the controllable co&#8208;assembly process of Pt precursors within ordered mesostructures. The resultant SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO  2  shows uniform SAL Pt clusters (~ 1.2 nm) anchored in ultrathin 2D nanosheets (~ 7 nm) with a high surface area (139 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), a large pore size (~ 25 nm) and a high dispersion (~ 99%). Moreover, this strategy is universal for the synthesis of other SAL metal clusters (Pd and Au) on 2D mTiO  2  with high exposure and accessibility. When used as a catalyst for hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene, the SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO  2  shows a high catalytic activity (TOF up to 2424 h  &#8208;1  ), 100% selectivity for 4&#8208;aminostyrene, good stability, and anti&#8208;resistance to thiourea poisoning under relatively mild conditions (25 &#176;C, 10 bar).</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photoreduction of Diluted CO2 to Tunable Syngas by Ni&#8208;Co Dual Sites through d&#8208;band Center Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2  into syngas is a promising way to address the energy and environmental challenges. Here we report the integration of Ni&#8208;Co dual sites on Ni doped Co3O4  ultrathin nanosheets assembled double&#8208;hollow nanotube (Ni&#8208;Co3O4  NSDHN) for efficient photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2  .  Quasi  in&#8208;situ  spectra and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the declining of  d  &#8208;band center of Ni&#8208;Co dual sites enables the electrons accumulation in the  dxz  /dyz  &#8208;2&#960;  * and  dz2  &#8208;5&#963;  orbitals. As a result, the binding strength of *CO is weakened and the *H adsorption site is modulated from metal sites to an oxygen site. Remarkably,  Ni&#8208;Co3O4  NSDHN  exhibits superior diluted CO2  photoconversion activity and controllable selectivity under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight. A syngas evolution rate of 170.0 mmol g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  with an apparent quantum yield of 3.7% and continuously adjustable CO/H2  ratios from  1:10 to 10:1  are achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Perylene&#8208;based Amphiphilic Micelle and Its Efficient Adsorption and In Situ Photodegradation of Bisphenol A in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new idea of designing self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic micelles containing photo&#8208;functional perylene blocks for &#8220;selective adsorption/catalytic degradation&#8221; of bisphenol A (BPA) has been put forward. The results show that the micelles possess high mass&#8208;transfer efficiency with ultrafast adsorption rate (within 10&#8197;s), high adsorption capacity (448&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high selectivity for BPA, which greatly improves the BPA photodegradation efficiency.







Abstract
Low mass&#8208;transfer efficiency and reaction&#8208;driving force make it difficult to realize thorough purification in traditional low&#8208;concentration pollutant treatments. Herein, we propose an &#8220;adsorption/catalysis in situ&#8221; perylene based bifunctional micelle for efficient, accurate and rapid adsorption and catalytic degradation of low&#8208;concentration bisphenol A (BPA). They show super&#8208;fast (within 10&#8197;s), high capacity (448&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and selectivity for BPA adsorption, due to &#960;&#8211;&#960;, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The BPA degradation efficiency improves by up to 8&#8197;times after forming micelles compared with simple perylene nanorods, which is primarily due to the superior mass&#8208;transfer from adsorption. Moreover, self&#8208;assembly can optimize the stacking of the perylene moieties and facilitate charge transfer in micelle, and the regular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of inside perylene units enhances the response to visible light, resulting in high catalytic capacity and good cycling stability.

         <title>Unshared Pair Electrons of Zincophilic Lewis Base Enable Long&#8208;life Zn Anodes under &#8220;Three High&#8221; Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy by introducing Lewis basic solvent additive with unshared pair electrons in electrolyte is proposed for dendrite&#8208;free and stable Zn anodes. Benefitting from the zincophilic feature and unique electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristic of Lewis basic unshared pair electrons, the designed electrolytes promote the Coulombic efficiency and lifespan in both Zn symmetric and full cells at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution and dendrite issues are the notorious culprits of the limited lifespan and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn anodes, particularly at harsh test conditions. Herein, considering the Lewis acidic feature of Zn2+, abundant unshared pair electrons of zincophilic Lewis bases are proposed as decent electrolyte additives to stabilize Zn anodes at &#8220;Three High&#8221; conditions (high depth of discharge, high areal capacity and high current). The unshared pair electrons can remove H2O from Zn2+ solvated sheaths and confine the activity of H2O by breaking its hydrogen bonding network. The combination of these factors effectively restricts H2O&#8208;involved side reactions and enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, even at harsh conditions. The effectiveness of this strategy is fully proved by a series of Lewis base molecules. Noticeably, the Zn||Zn cell with an area of 20&#8197;cm2, using DMF&#8208;containing electrolyte can be stably cycled over 1000&#8197;h at 60&#8201;% DOD, with a 100&#8201;% CE.

         <title>On&#8208;Site Non&#8208;enzymatic Orthogonal Activation of a Catalytic DNA Circuit for Self&#8208;Reinforced In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;enzymatically and orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit was prepared for on&#8208;site and efficient in vivo microRNA (miRNA) imaging without off&#8208;site signal leakage. The CCD circuit integrates the cell&#8208;specific endogenous stimulation of the auxiliary catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) with the orthogonal activation of the main entropy&#8208;driven DNA reaction (EDR) for sensitive target detection.







Abstract
The wide extracellular&#8208;intracellular distribution of microRNA requires the on&#8208;site, robust and efficient activation of catalytic DNA circuits inside live cells. Herein, we develop an efficient non&#8208;enzymatic circuitry activation strategy to realize the orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit for achieving high&#8208;fidelity in vivo microRNA imaging through multiply guaranteed molecular recognition and progressively accelerated signal amplification. For predictable on&#8208;site activation and useful catalytic efficiency, the dominating circuitry fuel strand was initially split into inactive fuel subunits that were grafted into an auxiliary catalytic circuit. There, the in&#8208;cell&#8208;specific mRNA triggered the orthogonal amplification of the active fuel strands for sensitive target detection through the chief entropy&#8208;driven catalytic DNA circuit. We believe that the on&#8208;site orthogonal circuitry activation method can contribute to clinical diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Nearly&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield and 12&#8208;Hour Afterglow from a Transparent Perovskite of Cs2NaScCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Tb</title>

         <dc:description>
Transparent Cs2NaSc1&#8722;xCl6: xTb3+ single crystals with ca. 98.2&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) were grown by a hydrothermal method. The doped crystal exhibited an intense green afterglow of 12&#8197;hours upon ceasing the X&#8208;ray excitation. Based on this improved output of the transparent crystals, a radiation&#8208;storage battery was designed, which has a linear&#8208;scaling capacity with loading weight.Unlike afterglow phosphors, transparent crystals free of scattering issues hold great potential in applications such as volumetric displays and three&#8208;dimensional encryption. Here, a double&#8208;perovskite host of ca. 85&#8201;% transparency, a Cs2NaScCl6 single crystal, was grown in aqueous solution. Through heavy doping of Tb ions, the crystal exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) up to 98.2&#8201;%. Both steady&#8208;state and transient PL spectroscopic investigation revealed a cross&#8208;relaxation efficiency (&#951;CR&#8776;99&#8201;%) between Tb ions, greatly mitigated the electron saturation on the 5D3 level and encouraged the radiative route against quenching.

         <title>Tuning the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Polymerization through Cocrystallization of the Monomer with an Inert Isostere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the regioselectivity of topochemical reactions is challenging as they occur under reagent&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. Employing a cocrystal strategy, we rationally tuned the regiochemistry of a topochemical polymerization. A monomer, known to polymerize topochemically to give a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 blend of two differently linked polymers, was cocrystallized with a dummy molecule. This cocrystal underwent topochemical polymerization regioselectively.







Abstract
Regiochemistry of topochemical reactions depends on the crystal packing and biasing the regiochemistry necessitates precise crystal engineering. The pristine crystals of monomer 1 upon topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction give a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 blend of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymers due to the presence of two self&#8208;sorted reactive conformers in the crystal. We designed a binary isomorphous cocrystal of monomer 1 and a structurally similar dummy molecule 2 to limit the number of reactive conformers of 1 to one and thus to get one type of polymer. Equimolar solution of 1 and 2 in chloroform&#8208;acetone mixture gave two 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals Co&#8208;I and Co&#8208;II. The Co&#8208;II, a chloroform adduct, on heating undergoes desolvation and polymorphic transition to Co&#8208;I. Co&#8208;I is isomorphic to 1 and 2 and possess self&#8208;sorted arrays of 1 and 2. Heating Co&#8208;I results in the TAAC polymerization giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer of 1 selectively, showing the power of crystal engineering in regiocontrol.

         <title>Bismuth&#8208;Mediated &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Acidic Diketones with ortho&#8208;Substituted Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular, bismacycle&#8208;mediated method is disclosed for the oxidative coupling of cyclic and fluoroalkyl diketones with ortho&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids. A wide range of functionality is tolerated on both partners, providing direct access to agrochemically and pharmaceutically important motifs that are currently inaccessible by other approaches.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic and fluoroalkyl 1,3&#8208;diketones is made challenging by the highly stabilized nature of the corresponding enolates, and is especially difficult for sterically demanding aryl partners. As a general solution to this problem, we report the Bi&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling of acidic diones and ortho&#8208;substituted arylboronic acids. Starting from a bench&#8208;stable bismacycle precursor, a sequence of B&#8208;to&#8208;Bi transmetallation, oxidation and C&#8722;C bond formation furnishes the arylated diones. Development of methodology that tolerates both sensitive functionality and steric demand is supported by interrogation of key reactive intermediates. Application of our strategy to cyclic diones enables the concise synthesis of important agrochemical intermediates which were previously prepared using toxic Pb reagents. This methodology also enables the first ever arylation of fluoroalkyl diones which, upon condensation with hydrazine, provides direct access to valuable fluoroalkyl pyrazoles.

         <title>Identification of a Novel Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Type IV IDO1 Inhibitor Chemotype</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;natural products are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by existing NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of the novel pseudo&#8208;NP class termed apoxidoles. Biological investigation revealed potent reduction of cellular kynurenine levels by apoxidoles through selective targeting of apo&#8208;indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (apo&#8208;IDO1).







Abstract
Natural product (NP)&#8208;inspired design principles provide invaluable guidance for bioactive compound discovery. Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) are de novo combinations of NP fragments to target biologically relevant chemical space not covered by NPs. We describe the design and synthesis of apoxidoles, a novel pseudo&#8208;NP class, whereby indole&#8208; and tetrahydropyridine fragments are linked in monopodal connectivity not found in nature. Apoxidoles are efficiently accessible by an enantioselective [4+2] annulation reaction. Biological evaluation revealed that apoxidoles define a new potent type IV inhibitor chemotype of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a heme&#8208;containing enzyme considered a target for the treatment of neurodegeneration, autoimmunity and cancer. Apoxidoles target apo&#8208;IDO1, prevent heme binding and induce unique amino acid positioning as revealed by crystal structure analysis. Novel type IV apo&#8208;IDO1 inhibitors are in high demand, and apoxidoles may provide new opportunities for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research.

         <title>P and Cu Dual Sites on Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbon Fuels with High C2H6 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu and P dual sites were constructed in carbon nitride matrix for achieving highly efficient separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers. Benefiting from the unique dual sites structure, P/Cu SAs@CN exhibited outstanding photocatalytic CO2 conversion to C2H6.







Abstract
The light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products is especially meaningful, while the low efficiency of multi&#8208;electron transfer and sluggish C&#8722;C coupling greatly hinder its development. Herein, we report a photocatalyst comprising of P and Cu dual sites anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (P/Cu SAs@CN), which achieves a high C2H6 evolution rate of 616.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons. The detailed spectroscopic characterizations identify the formation of charge&#8208;enriched Cu sites, where the isolated P atoms serve as hole capture sites during photocatalysis. Theoretical simulations combined with in situ FTIR measurement reveal a kinetically feasible process for the formation of C&#8722;C coupling intermediate (*OC&#8722;COH) and confirm the favorable production of C2H6 on the P/Cu SAs@CN photocatalyst. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design with atomic precision toward highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion to high value&#8208;added carbon products.

&lt;p&gt;Cu and P dual sites were constructed in carbon nitride matrix for achieving highly efficient separation of photo-generated carriers. Benefiting from the unique dual sites structure, P/Cu SAs@CN exhibited outstanding photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to multi-carbon products is especially meaningful, while the low efficiency of multi-electron transfer and sluggish C&#8722;C coupling greatly hinder its development. Herein, we report a photocatalyst comprising of P and Cu dual sites anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (P/Cu SAs@CN), which achieves a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 616.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to hydrocarbons. The detailed spectroscopic characterizations identify the formation of charge-enriched Cu sites, where the isolated P atoms serve as hole capture sites during photocatalysis. Theoretical simulations combined with in situ FTIR measurement reveal a kinetically feasible process for the formation of C&#8722;C coupling intermediate (*OC&#8722;COH) and confirm the favorable production of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; on the P/Cu SAs@CN photocatalyst. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design with atomic precision toward highly efficient photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to high value-added carbon products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Surface Passivation and Hierarchical Structuring of Zeolite Beta Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) produces a zeolite with an epitaxially grown Si&#8208;rich shell on the exterior rim, which passivates the surface reactivity. It is also possible to enhance intracrystalline mesoporosity via secondary hydrothermal treatment by taking advantage of intrinsic silanol defects in *BEA.







Abstract
We report a method to prepare core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) with an aluminous core and an epitaxial Si&#8208;rich shell. This method capitalizes on the inherent defects in *BEA crystals to simultaneously passivate acid sites on external surfaces and increase intracrystalline mesoporosity through facile post&#8208;hydrothermal synthesis modification in alkaline media. This process creates more hydrophobic materials by reducing silanol defects and enriching the shell in silica via a combination of dealumination and the relocation of silica from the core to the shell during intracrystalline mesopore formation. The catalytic consequences of *BEA core&#8211;shells relative to conventional analogues were tested using the biomass conversion of levulinic acid and n&#8208;butanol to n&#8208;butyl levulinate as a benchmark reaction. Our findings reveal that siliceous shells and intracrystalline mesopores synergistically enhance the performance of *BEA catalysts.

         <title>Electronic Character of &#945;,3&#8208;Dehydrotoluene Intermediates Generated from Isolable Allenyne&#8208;Containing Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;,3&#8208;Dehydroluenes (DHT), a relatively rare class of reactive intermediate(s), can be formed by warming isolable allenynes bearing a remote alkyne or nitrile. The product distributions produced in solvents of different polarity give insight to the electronic nature/structure of the DHTs (zwitterion vs. diradical vs. cyclic allene).







Abstract
We report here the generation of &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluenes, a relatively rare subset of reactive intermediates of the dehydroaromatic family, from isolable allenynes. The substructure motif in the allenyne substrates is distinct from, and complementary to, those found in Myers&#8208;Saito/Schmittel&#8208;type cycloisomerizations. The reactions reported here give rise to product profiles that provide insight about the electronic nature (i.e., diradical vs. zwitterion vs. cyclic allene) of the particular isomeric DHT(s) that is(are) produced under different reaction conditions differing most significantly in the polarity of the reaction solvent. One example also revealed previously unobserved carbene&#8208;like reactivity of the DHT.

         <title>Olefin&#8211;Borane Interactions in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Fluorophores that Undergo Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pair&#8208;Type Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Olefin&#8211;borane interaction can be used to modulate the electron&#8208;accepting ability of boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores with alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl groups exhibit response even to a bulky Lewis base through a frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP)&#8208;type addition. Reversible association/dissociation behavior of the adduct is observed in response to temperature over a range above ambient temperature.







Abstract
Olefin&#8211;borane &#960;&#8208;complexes have been postulated as intermediates for the addition of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to olefins. In the present study, we have employed this weak interaction to modulate the electronic properties of boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. A series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorophores that contain an alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl group is synthesized. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the olefin and boron moieties are held in close proximity. Upon addition of a Lewis base to a solution of these D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A fluorophores, an FLP&#8208;type addition occurs with concurrent significant changes in the absorption and emission properties. The FLP&#8208;type reaction shifts the reaction site from the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron atom to a carbocationic center, and thereby even facilitates a reaction with bulky Lewis bases. For example, a tricyclohexylphosphine adduct thus generated exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent reversible dissociation/association behavior. These results provide a design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive emissive boron&#8208;based materials.

         <dc:description>
We disclose photocyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;&#8208;extension as an effective strategy to develop boron&#8208;doped molecular ribbons. A series of ribbon&#8208;type boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including two isomers with the C68B2 &#960;&#8208;skeletons were synthesized, and their contorted topological conformations, photochromism behaviors and electronic properties were demonstrated.







Abstract
Molecular ribbons (MRs), one&#8208;dimentional topological polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are of importance for synthetic chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we disclose an effective strategy to develop boron&#8208;doped MRs, i.e. photochemical cyclization on conjugated organoboranes for rapid &#960;&#8208;extension. A series of ribbon&#8208;type boron&#8208;doped PAHs that own multiple cove edges were synthesized using Mallory photoreaction in solution. Two of them feature isomeric C68B2 &#960;&#8208;skeletons with 2.2&#8197;nm in length, thus representing a new kind of boron&#8208;doped MRs. The boron atoms endow them with sufficient Lewis acidity, and notably, the formed Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts based on boron&#8208;doped MRs display the photo&#8208;induced dual&#8208;dissociation behavior in the excited state and thus photochromism property. Moreover, despite of the highly contorted topological conformations, their potential utility as organic semiconductor was demonstrated by fabrication of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Modular Construction of Heterobiaryl Atropisomers and Axially Chiral Styrenes via All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted VQMs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted VQM is generated by chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed nucleophilic addition of 2&#8208;alkynylnaphthols to o&#8208;quinone methides or imines, and it can be captured intramolecularly by a cycloaddition reaction. A wide range of naphthyl&#8208;2H&#8208;chromenes bearing axially and centrally chiral elements and axially chiral quinone&#8208;naphthols were prepared efficiently with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Here we report a new type of chiral all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted VQMs generated via chiral phosphoric acids catalyzed nucleophilic addition of 2&#8208;alkynylnaphthols to o&#8208;quinone methides or imines, which can be captured intramolecularly as a result of cycloaddition reaction. A new class of naphthyl&#8208;2H&#8208;chromenes bearing axially and centrally chiral elements and axially chiral quinone&#8208;naphthols were prepared efficiently with good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities. Noteworthy, the enantioselective cycloaddition of alkynylnaphthols with o&#8208;quinone methides proceeded via a [2+2] cycloaddition, followed by a retro&#8208;4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and a 6&#960; re&#8208;cyclization. While the cycloaddition of alkynylnaphthols with imines proceeded via a sequential [2+4] cycloaddition and an auto oxidation reaction. Moreover, the obtained axially chiral naphthols can be converted into valuable phosphine ligands and other functional molecules.

         <title>Direct Dry Synthesis of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts: A Study on Comminution and Alloying of Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic supported nanoparticles can be obtained by direct ball milling of the coarse powders of the metals and oxide support. The process was time&#8208;resolved via X&#8208;ray diffraction methods and electron microscopy so that a possible mechanism for the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles was developed. The study was extended to different systems, and it was found that final material features, like metal dispersion, can be predicted.







Abstract
Ball milling is growing increasingly important as an alternative synthetic tool to prepare catalytic materials. It was recently observed that supported metal catalysts could be directly obtained upon ball milling from the coarse powders of metal and oxide support. Moreover, when two compatible metal sources are simultaneously subjected to the mechanochemical treatment, bimetallic nanoparticles are obtained. A systematic investigation was extended to different metals and supports to understand better the mechanisms involved in the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles. Based on this, a model describing the role of metal&#8208;support interactions in the synthesis was developed. The findings will be helpful for the future rational design of supported metal catalysts via dry ball milling.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Symmetric Azoarenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Silicon&#8208;Masked Diazenyl Anions and (Hetero)Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric azobenzene derivatives by an unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;N(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling is presented. N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;silyldiazenes are employed as diazenyl anion equivalents that can be selectively coupled under palladium catalysis with a large array of (hetero)aryl bromides in high yields. The functional&#8208;group tolerance on either (hetero)aryl ring is excellent.







Abstract
The photoswitchable motif of azobenzenes is of great importance across the life and materials sciences. This maintains a constant demand for their efficient synthesis, especially that of non&#8208;symmetric derivatives. We disclose here a general strategy for their synthesis through an unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;N(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling where functionalized aryl&#8208;substituted diazenes masked with a silyl group are employed as diazenyl pronucleophiles. These equivalents of fragile diazenyl anions couple with a diverse set of (hetero)aryl bromides under palladium catalysis with no loss of dinitrogen. The competing denitrogenative biaryl formation is fully suppressed. The reaction requires only a minimal excess, that is 1.2 equivalents, of the diazenyl component. By this, a broad range of azoarenes decorated with two electron&#8208;rich/deficient aryl groups can be accessed in a predictable way with superb functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional&#8208;on&#8208;Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;on&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures is achieved for the first time. In photocatalytic H2 production, the 2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF shows a unique &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;hybrid&#8221; effect, which led to a significant photoactivity enhancement over those of the traditional &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;identical&#8221; 2D, 3D, and 3D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF structures.







Abstract
A MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure is attractive in material science because of its potential combined effects in catalysis. However, precisely controlling the growth pattern at the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nucleation stage to manipulate the metallic composition and structure dimensionality remain a challenge. Herein, we introduce a polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;assist kinetic&#8208;control strategy to achieve the &#8220;anti&#8208;epitaxial growth&#8221; pattern of a foreign MOF nucleus on the (111) facets of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 octahedron seeds, and construct diverse two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;on&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D) MOF heterostructures (2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D Cu, Zn, Cd, Co, and Ni). Notably, the 2D&#8208;on&#8208;3D Cu exhibits a unique &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;hybrid&#8221; effect in photocatalysis which led to a significant photoactivity enhancement over those of the traditional &#8220;dimensionality&#8208;identical&#8221; 2D, 3D and 3D&#8208;on&#8208;3D MOF structures.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Acrylamides via Lewis&#8208;Base&#8208;Mediated Aryl/Hydrogen Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DABCO&#8208;induced polar aryl migration allows for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl acrylamides from sulfonyl acrylimides. This reaction proceeds through a formal aryl/hydrogen exchange, including SO2 loss. A range of valuable building blocks have been synthesised and the underlying reaction mechanism has been explored using quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Herein we report a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl acrylamides leveraging polar S&#8208;to&#8208;C aryl migrations induced by a Lewis basic organocatalyst. In contrast to previously reported radical aryl migrations of sulfonyl acrylimides, this polar process enables subsequent elimination, ultimately leading to a formal aryl/hydrogen exchange including SO2 extrusion. This reaction is selective for electron&#8208;deficient aromatic groups, while tolerating a variety of substituents on nitrogen and in the &#946;&#8208;position, and it delivers useful building blocks for further transformations, including cycloaddition and cyclisation reactions. The mechanism was investigated in detail using quantum chemical calculations, which unexpectedly revealed the Lewis base to be involved in several decisive steps.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Ubiquitin&#8208;like Protein ISG15 Tools through Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Ligation Catalyzed by a Viral Protease Lbpro</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protease (Lbpro) from foot&#8208;and&#8208;mouth disease virus can ligate synthetic glycyl compounds to ISG15 (interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15), generating various ISG15 protein tools for cellular proteomic studies, as well as screening and evaluation of small molecules against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro). This strategy can also synthesize ISG15&#8208;modified peptide and Ub (ubiquitin)/NEDD8 (ubiquitin&#8208;like protein Nedd8) protein tools.







Abstract
Ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;like protein ISG15 (interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15) regulates innate immunity and links with the evasion of host response by viruses such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Dissecting ISGylation pathways recently received increasing attention which can inform related disease interventions, but such studies necessitate the preparation and development of various ISG15 protein tools. Here, we find that the leader protease (Lbpro) encoded by foot&#8208;and&#8208;mouth disease virus can promote ligation reactions between recombinant ISG15 and synthetic glycyl compounds, generating protein tools such as ISG15&#8208;propargylamide and ISG15&#8208;rhodamine110, which are needed for cellular proteomic studies of deISGylases, and the screening and evaluation of inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro). Furthermore, this strategy can be also used to load ISG15 onto the lysine of a synthetic peptide through an isopeptide bond, and prepare Ub and NEDD8 (ubiquitin&#8208;like protein Nedd8) protein tools.

         <title>Divergent CO2 Activation by Tuning the Lewis Acid in Iron&#8208;Based Bimetallic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting CO2 activation reactivity using bimetallic Fe0/Lewis acid combinations is reported. The use of gold promotes irreversible CO2/N2 exchange, whereas push&#8208;pull CO2 fixation structures emerge from the use of acidic zinc and borane compounds. The use of an alane, Al(C6F5)3, promotes bimetallic C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Computational studies support the observed divergent reactivity and substantiate the bonding scenario.







Abstract
Bimetallic motifs mediate the selective activation and functionalization of CO2 in metalloenzymes and some recent synthetic systems. In this work, we build on the nascent concept of bimetallic frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to investigate the activation and reduction of CO2. Using the Fe0 fragment [(depe)2Fe] (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) as base, we modify the nature of the partner Lewis acid to accomplish a divergent and highly chemoselective reactivity towards CO2. [Au(PMe2Ar)]+ irreversibly dissociates CO2, Zn(C6F5)2 and B(C6F5)3 yield different CO2 adducts stabilized by push&#8208;pull interactions, while Al(C6F5)3 leads to a rare heterobimetallic C&#8722;O bond cleavage, and thus to contrasting reduced products after exposure to dihydrogen. Computational investigations provide a rationale for the divergent reactivity, while Energy Decomposition Analysis&#8208;Natural Orbital for Chemical Valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) method substantiates the heterobimetallic bonding situation.

         <title>Transfer Hydrogenation with a Carbon&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Photocatalyst and Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water&#8208;donating transfer hydrogenation can be achieved over a palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon nitride, in which hydrogen protons generated from photocatalytic water splitting are sequentially added to various unsaturated bonds. In&#8208;depth characterization confirms the direct hydrogenation mechanism and links the outstanding performance to reduced barriers for hydrogenation and accelerated proton supply from water.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds has received considerable attention in the research area of sustainable organic synthesis; however, water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen, has rarely been investigated due to the high barrier associated with splitting of water molecules. We report a carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalyst with unparalleled performance in photocatalytic water&#8208;donating transfer hydrogenation compared to its nanoparticle counterparts. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments and operando nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirm the direct hydrogenation mechanism using in situ&#8208;generated protons from water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Density functional theory calculations attribute the high activity to lower barriers for hydrogenation, facilitated desorption of ethylbenzene, and facile hydrogen replenishment from water on the atomic palladium sites.

         <title>Direct Arene Trifluoromethylation Enabled by a High&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound enables direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes for the first time. Thermolysis of CuIII&#8722;CF3 bond provides concurrently CF3 radical and a CuII oxidant, which synergistically engage in a SEAr type reaction with arenes. This study establishes an unprecedented fundamental reactivity of CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound, and thus represents a significant progress for CuIII chemistry.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes poses an important synthetic challenge that is highly desirable. High&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds have often been invoked in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation reactions, but the fundamental reactivity toward arenes is elusive. Herein, direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes/heteroarenes by a high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound is disclosed for the first time. The CuIII&#8722;CF3 compound serves CF3 radical and a CuII oxidant by homolytic cleavage of a CuIII&#8722;CF3 bond, which engage synergistically in a SEAr type reaction with arenes. The presence of K2S2O8 co&#8208;oxidant can significantly improve the reaction yields. This reaction shows good efficiency, broad functional group tolerance, and the potential in late&#8208;stage functionalization. The reactivity of high&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;CF3 compounds disclosed in this study represents an important progress in organofluorine and CuIII chemistry.

         <title>Anion&#8208;trap Engineering toward Remarkable Crystallographic Reorientation and Efficient Cation Migration of Zn Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn batteries are considered as potential candidates in future power sources, however suffer problems of rampant dendrite/by&#8208;product on Zn anodes, torpid Zn2+ transfer/diffusion and poor energy density. Inspired by the host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, an anion&#8208;trap agent &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) is introduced into the Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte to induce dominant Zn (002) deposition and improve Zn2+ migration behaviors. The anion ClO4&#8208; is revealed to be trapped inside the cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD, impairing barriers for Zn2+ migration and significantly elevate the Zn2+ transference number to 0.878. Meanwhile, the &#946;&#8208;CD@ClO4&#8208; complex shows the function in preferential growth of the Zn (002), blocking the approach of dendrite growth.

Inspired by the host-guest interaction chemistry, an anion-trap agent &#946;-cyclodextrin (&#946;-CD) is introduced into the Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte to induce dominant Zn (002) deposition and improve Zn2+ migration behaviors. The anion ClO4- is revealed to be trapped inside the cavity of &#946;-CD, impairing barriers for Zn2+ migration and significantly elevate the Zn2+ transference number to 0.878. Meanwhile, the &#946;-CD@ClO4- complex shows the function in preferential growth of the Zn (002), blocking the approach of dendrite growth. Above combined functions lead to substantial enhancement in long-term stability and cell capacity, as proved by 10 times longer life of Zn||Zn symmetric cells and 57% capacity increasement of Zn-MnO2 full cells (at 0.1 A g-1) compared with that of pure Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Alkyl&#8208;Carbamoylation of Internal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reductive dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkenes has been developed to enable the formation of vicinal stereogenic centers. This protocol allows for facile synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinones bearing vicinal or quaternary stereocenters with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. DFT calculations suggest that the enantiodetermining step is intramolecular migratory insertion with a carbamoyl&#8208;NiI intermediate.







Abstract
Herein, we leverage the Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkenes with alkyl iodides to enable the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinones bearing vicinal stereogenic centers. The application of newly developed 1&#8208;NapQuinim is critical for formation of two contiguous stereocenters in high yield, enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity. This catalytic system also improves both the yield and enantioselectivity in the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams. Computational studies reveal that the enantiodetermining step proceeds with a carbamoyl&#8208;NiI intermediate that is reduced by the Mn reductant prior to intramolecular migratory insertion. The presence of the t&#8208;butyl group of the Quinim ligand leads to an unfavorable distortion of the substrate in the TS that leads to the minor enantiomer. Calculations also support an improvement in enantioselectivity with 1&#8208;NapQuinim compared to p&#8208;tolQuinim.

         <title>Structural and Dynamic Analysis of Sulphur Dioxide Adsorption in a Series of Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework materials have been investigated for reversible SO2 uptake. The incorporation of atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII, amine or heteroatomic sulphur sites enhances the uptake of SO2 at low concentrations. This work confirms that control of pore environments is an important approach for optimising the adsorption of SO2 at low concentrations.







Abstract
We report reversible high capacity adsorption of SO2 in robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials. Zr&#8208;bptc (H4bptc=biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid) shows a high SO2 uptake of 6.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, reflecting excellent capture capability and removal of SO2 at low concentration (2500&#8197;ppm). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the introduction of amine, atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII or heteroatomic sulphur sites into the pores enhance the capture of SO2 at low concentrations. The captured SO2 can be converted quantitatively to a pharmaceutical intermediate, aryl N&#8208;aminosulfonamide, thus converting waste to chemical values. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared micro&#8208;spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering enable the visualisation of the binding domains of adsorbed SO2 molecules and host&#8211;guest binding dynamics in these materials at the atomic level. Refinement of the pore environment plays a critical role in designing efficient sorbent materials.

         <title>Sulfur&#8211;Phenolate Exchange: SuFEx&#8208;Derived Dynamic Covalent Reactions and Degradation of SuFEx Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur(VI)&#8211;phenolate exchange (SuPhenEx) reaction between sulfonimidates and phenols has been shown to generate new sulfonimidates that undergo dynamic covalent reactions with other phenols. The fast, high&#8208;yielding, and enantiospecific reactions are useful for both asymmetric synthesis and the degradation of SuFEx polymers. The wide scope of the reaction extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click reactions.







Abstract
The products of the SuFEx reaction between sulfonimidoyl fluorides and phenols, sulfonimidates, are shown to display dynamic covalent chemistry with other phenols. This reaction was shown to be enantiospecific, finished in minutes at room temperature in high yields, and useful for both asymmetric synthesis and sustainable polymer production. Its wide scope further extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click chemistries.

         <title>Tailoring Phase Alignment and Interfaces via Polyelectrolyte Anchoring Enables Large&#8208;Area 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Tailored P3CT&#8208;BA polyelectrolyte is demonstrated to be an efficient hole&#8208;transporting layer for large&#8208;area 2D perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency approaching 18&#8201;%, and large&#8208;area (2&#215;3&#8197;cm2, 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2) 2D perovskite devices are also reported with an impressive efficiency of 14.81&#8201;% and 11.13&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper phase 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit improved lifetime while still facing challenges such as phase alignment and up&#8208;scaling to module&#8208;level devices. Herein, polyelectrolytes are explored to tackle this issue. The contact between perovskite and hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) is important for decreasing interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and scalable fabrication of uniform 2D perovskite films. Through exploring compatible butylamine cations, we first demonstrate poly(3&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybutyl)thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;butylamine (P3CT&#8208;BA) as an efficient HTL for 2D PSCs due to its great hydrophilicity, relatively high hole mobility and uniform surface. More importantly, the tailored P3CT&#8208;BA has an anchoring effect and acts as the buried passivator for 2D perovskites. Consequently, a best efficiency approaching 18&#8201;% was achieved and we further first report large&#8208;area (2&#215;3&#8197;cm2, 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2) 2D perovskite minimodules with an impressive efficiency of 14.81&#8201;% and 11.13&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;oxo Nodes of MOFs with Tunable Electronic Properties Provide Effective &#8901;OH Species for Enhanced Methane Hydroxylation</title>

UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts modified with various ligands can directly convert CH4 into oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity by using H2O2 as an oxidant under mild conditions. The Zr&#8208;oxo nodes have different electronic properties that affected the anchoring of &#8901;OH species to form effective Zroxo&#8722;&#8901;OH sites. These sites promote the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of CH4.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions has attracted extensive interest. However, the over&#8208;oxidation of target products is usually unavoidable due to the easily excessive activation of C&#8722;H bond on the sites of supported metal species. Here, we identified the most efficient Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane with H2O2. These nodes were modified by three types of benzene 1, 4&#8208;dicarboxylates (NH2&#8208;BDC, H2BDC, and NO2&#8208;BDC). Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that these ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes and the H2BDC ligand led to optimal electronic density of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes in UiO&#8208;66. Thus the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H catalyst promoted the formation of &#8901;OH species that adsorbed on Zr&#8208;oxo nodes, and facilitated the activation of methane with a lower energy barrier and subsequent conversion to hydroxylation oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity.

         <title>Lysosome Interference Enabled by Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Assembly of DNA Nanoframeworks inside Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of DNA nanoframeworks inside cells couples with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation to give the rational modulation of lysosomal functions. These include lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thereby improving the delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs.







Abstract
Coupling materials chemistry systems to biological processes is a promising way to rationally modulate lysosomal functions. A proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of a DNA nanoframework inside cells coupled with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation, gives the rational modulation of lysosomal functions, which we term &#8220;lysosome interference&#8221;. Through lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis, the DNA nanoframework with acid&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;i&#8208;motif enters the lysosome and assembles into an aggregate in a process triggered by lysosomal acidity. The aggregate is suitable for long&#8208;term retention. The consumption of protons resulted in lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thus hindering the degradation of nucleic acid drugs in the lysosome and improving gene silencing effects. This study shows a new way to achieve lysosome interference by coupling the subcellular microenvironment with a precisely programmable assembly system.

         <title>Impact of Strain Relaxation on 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual strain in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Strain relaxation facilitated by the organic spacer cations leads to improved film quality, suppressed recombination, and enhanced device performance under external stress.







Abstract
Although the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached the commercial standards, the unsatisfactory stability limits their further application. Hydrophobic interface and encapsulation can block the damage of water and oxygen, while the instability induced by intrinsic residual strain remains inevitable. Here, the residual strain in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. It's found that the spacer cations contribute to the residual strain even though they are not in the inorganic cages. Benefited from strain relaxation, the film quality is improved, leading to suppressed recombination, promoted charge transport and enhanced efficiency. More significantly, the strain&#8208;released devices maintain 86&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after being kept in air with 85&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) for 1080&#8197;h, 82&#8201;% under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 804&#8197;h and 86&#8201;% after continuous heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1080&#8197;h.

         <title>Trojan Nanobacteria System for Photothermal Programmable Destruction of Deep Tumor Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trojan nanobacteria for tumor targeting and inhibition have been constructed in which the photothermal nanoparticles are loaded inside the bacteria. The bacteria target the tumor region and penetrate deep tumor tissues. The photothermal effect inhibits the tumor growth and deactivates the bacteria. The use of bacteria allows for genetic modification which adds additional therapeutic modalities against tumor growth.







Abstract
A novel bacteria&#8208;based drug delivery system, termed &#8220;Trojan nanobacteria system&#8221;, has been developed in which nanoagents are internalized into engineered bacteria through bacteria&#8208;specific maltodextrin (MD) transporters. Compared to the method of attaching nanoagents to bacterial surfaces, this Trojan system features higher payloads and better stability. In cancer therapy, Trojan nanobacteria can specifically discriminate the tumor region and then penetrate deep tumor tissues. Once in the tumor, the Trojan nanobacteria systems are able to destroy deep tumor tissues due to the combined effects of antitumor protein expression (e.g., tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;) and photothermal properties.

         <title>Biodegradable Ca2+ Nanomodulators Activate Pyroptosis through Mitochondrial Ca2+ Overload for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) that can activate pyroptosis for cancer immunotherapy are reported. The CaNMs decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin (CUR), leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions. This Ca2+ overload triggers an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the release of cytochrome&#8197;C, activation of caspase&#8208;3, and cleavage of GSDME, causing cell bubbling and pyrolysis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis provides a new direction and broad prospects for cancer immunotherapy. However, the development of a nanoplatform as a pyroptosis inducer is limited, and the discovery of a new type of nano&#8208;pyroptosis inducer for cancer immunotherapy is still imminent. Herein, biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) are prepared as pyroptosis inducers for cancer immunotherapy via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. The obtained CaNMs can decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin, leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions, eventually resulting in pyroptosis. We not only confirm the occurrence of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload&#8208;triggered pyroptosis for the first time but also reveal the robust immune responses via CaNMs, along with remarkably suppressing tumor proliferation and lung metastasis. This work will provide new strategies and inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cancer treatments, greatly contributing to the further development of Ca2+ nanomodulators.

         <title>Molecularly Precise, Bright, Photostable, and Biocompatible Cyanine Nanodots as Alternatives to Quantum Dots for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine nanodots constructed by step&#8208;by&#8208;step divergent synthesis of cyanine dye&#8208;cored polylysine dendrimers possess many of the merits of quantum dots and organic fluorophores, including precise structure, well&#8208;defined size, strong and stable fluorescence, and a customizable fluorescence spectrum. A strategy is described for synthesis of various precise fluorescent nanoparticles with optical properties that are relevant to biomedical applications.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging with fluorophores has become a powerful way to explore complex biological systems and visualize nanoparticles for drug delivery. However, it is challenging to develop fluorophores with ideal physical and optical properties. We report a method to synthesize cyanine nanodots with a single&#8208;molecule structure, well&#8208;defined particle size, customizable fluorescent spectrum, and bright and stable fluorescence. These cyanine nanodots are acquired by the divergent synthesis of cyanine&#8208;dye&#8208;cored polylysine (PLL) dendrimers. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method by synthesizing cyanine 3 (Cy3), cyanine 5 (Cy5), or cyanine 7 (Cy7) cored single&#8208;molecule nanodots up to eight generations with a size of around 11&#8197;nm. We show that these cyanine nanodots are capable of multiple biomedical applications, including multicolor cellular tracing and cancer imaging. These cyanine nanodots possess many merits of organic dots and quantum dots that are promising for future application.

         <title>Umpolung in a Pair of Cobalt(III) Terminal Imido/Imidyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to a CoIII terminal imidyl radical complex was provided by one&#8208;electron oxidation of a CoIII terminal imido precursor. Oxidation of the CoIII terminal imido to its imidyl redox isomer facilitates intramolecular migratory insertion reactions of the imido with an NHC ligand by a switch of mechanism through umpolung of the imido ligand.







Abstract
Reaction of the CoI complex [(TIMMNmes)CoI](PF6) (1) (TIMMNmes=tris&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesityl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;methyl]amine) with mesityl azide yields the CoIII imide [(TIMMNmes)CoIII(NMes)](PF6) (2). Oxidation of 2 with [FeCp2](PF6) provides access to a rare CoIII imidyl [(TIMMNmes)Co(NMes)](PF6)2 (3). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy confirm the molecular structure of 3 and its S=
 ground state. ENDOR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and computational analyses indicate a ligand&#8208;based oxidation; thus, an imidyl&#8208;radical electronic structure for 3. Migratory insertion of one ancillary NHC to the imido ligand in 2 gives the CoI N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (4) within 12&#8197;h. Conversely, it takes merely 0.5&#8197;h for 3 to transform to the CoII congener (5). The migratory insertion in 2 occurs via a nucleophilic attack of the imido ligand at the NHC to give 4, whereas in 3, a nucleophilic attack of the NHC at the electrophilic imidyl ligand yields 5. The reactivity shunt upon oxidation of 2 to 3 confirms an umpolung of the imido ligand.

         <title>An Adaptive Rhodium Catalyst to Control the Hydrogenation Network of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive rhodium&#8208;based catalyst for controlled hydrogenation of nitroarenes to hydroxylamines and anilines is presented. Both product platforms could be accessed under mild conditions and excellent yields using molecular hydrogen as the reducing agent. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to shed light on the mode of functioning of the catalyst and elucidate the origin of adaptivity.







Abstract
An adaptive catalytic system that provides control over the nitroarene hydrogenation network to prepare a wide range of aniline and hydroxylamine derivatives is presented. This system takes advantage of a delicate interplay between a rhodium(III) center and a Lewis acidic borane introduced in the secondary coordination sphere of the metal. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst in the presence of various potentially vulnerable functional groups and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to shed light on the mode of functioning of the catalyst and elucidate the origin of adaptivity. The competition for interaction with boron between a solvent molecule and a substrate was found crucial for adaptivity. When operating in THF, the reduction network stops at the hydroxylamine platform, whereas the reaction can be directed to the aniline platform in toluene.

         <title>A General and Efficient Solution to Monofluoroalkylation: Divergent Synthesis of Aliphatic Monofluorides with Modular Synthetic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method allows preparation of diverse monofluorides based on the monofluoroalkyl triflate scaffold. Both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of Grignard reagents were studied. Further utilities including conversion into conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs.







Abstract
Monofluoroalkanes are important in many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. However, the lack of easily available and transformable monofluoroalkylating reagents that facilitate a broad array of transformations has hampered the application of monofluoroalkylation. Herein, we report a general and efficient method of preparing diverse aliphatic monofluorides with monofluoroalkyl triflate as the synthetic scaffold. Using both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation, the general diversification of the monofluoroalkylating scaffold has been exhibited. The broad utility of this monofluoroalkylating reagent is shown by concise conversion into various conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs with commercially available heteroatom&#8208;based coupling partners.

         <title>A Traceless Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation on Native Antibodies Enables Efficient One&#8208;Step Payload Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>

A traceless one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) has been established using a novel thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer design with an optimized Fc&#8208;binding ligand, which enables ligand self&#8208;release during payload assembly. This strategy exhibits excellent compatibility with various toxins, linkers, and IgG subclasses, implying the potential for broad applications in ligand&#8208;directed protein modifications.







Abstract
Direct chemical modification of native antibodies in a site&#8208;specific manner remains a great challenge. Ligand&#8208;directed conjugation can achieve the selective modification of antibodies, but usually requires multiple extra steps for ligand release and cargo assembly. Herein, we report a novel, traceless strategy to enable the facile and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) by harnessing a thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer reagent. The designed reagent, consisting of an optimized Fc&#8208;targeting ligand, a thioester bridge and a toxin payload, directly assembles the toxin precisely onto the K251 position of native IgGs and simultaneously self&#8208;releases the affinity ligand in one step. With this method, we synthesized a series of K251&#8208;linked ADCs from native Trastuzumab. These ADCs demonstrated excellent homogeneity, thermal stability, and both in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;tumor activity. This strategy is equally efficient for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subtypes.

         <title>Doping&#8208;Mediated Energy&#8208;Level Engineering of M@Au12 Superatoms (M=Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) for Efficient Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis</title>

A series of diphosphine&#8208;protected M@Au12 superatoms (M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) were synthesized and characterized. The photoluminescence quantum yield and photocatalytic activity of the M@Au12 superatoms were enhanced by doping with Pt, Rh, or Ir.







Abstract
We synthesized a series of MAu12(dppe)5Cl2 (MAu12; M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ir; dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), which have icosahedral M@Au12 superatomic cores, and systematically investigated their electronic structures, photoluminescence (PL) and photocatalytic properties. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was expanded when doping an M element positioned at the lower left of the periodic table. The PL quantum yield was enhanced with an increase in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and reached 0.46&#8211;0.67 for MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) under deaerated conditions. The bright PLs from MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) were assigned to phosphorescence based on quenching by O2. MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) acted as a more efficient and stable photocatalyst than Au13 for intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenone via the oxidative quenching cycle. This study provides rational guides for designing photoluminescent and photocatalytic gold superatoms by the doping of heterometal elements.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Adaptive Chiral [1]Rotaxane for Thermo&#8208;Rulable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; an emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle was proposed to achieve steerable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in solid state. The concept benefits from the adaptive confinement of the emitter in the nanocavity of the self&#8208;assembled nanoarchitectures.







Abstract
It remains a formidable challenge to realize thermo&#8208;rulable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we propose a new strategy by covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; the emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle as an adaptive chiral [1]rotaxane to address this issue. Different from its included analogue, the potted emitter [DS] showed adaptive conformers with tunable CPL in varied solvents. Significantly, upon controlled self&#8208;assembly, [DS] formed a channel&#8208;type nanoarchitecture ([DS]A), which exhibited an extraordinary thermo&#8208;rulable CPL between 25&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, the glum was large as 0.024 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which was amplified to 0.040 at 90&#8201;&#176;C with a decrease of QY (from 92&#8201;% to 80&#8201;%). By comparison, the assemblies of cage&#8208;type [DS]B and the unpotted emitter showed irreversible or unanswered thermal behaviors. The work demonstrated the thermo&#8208;rulable and durable CPL for the first time and provided an insightful understanding of thermal effect on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>Over 70&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Enabled by Potassium Dopant&#8208;Tuned Interaction between Copper Sites and Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium doping of Cu2Se nanosheet arrays on copper foam serves as a versatile method for tuning the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates. This approach enables CO2 electroreduction to ethanol as a single liquid product with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 70.3&#8201;% and an extraordinary stability for 130&#8197;h at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V.







Abstract
It is highly desired yet challenging to steer the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ER) toward ethanol with high selectivity, for which the evolution of reaction intermediates on catalytically active sites holds the key. Herein, we report that K doping in Cu2Se nanosheets array on Cu foam serves as a versatile way to tune the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates in CO2ER, enabling highly selective production of ethanol. As revealed by characterization and simulation, the electron transfer from K to Se can stabilize CuI species which facilitate the adsorption of linear *COL and bridge *COB intermediates to promote C&#8722;C coupling during CO2ER. As a result, the optimized K11.2%&#8208;Cu2Se nanosheets array can catalyze CO2ER to ethanol as a single liquid product with high selectivity in a potential area from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.2&#8197;V. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 70.3&#8201;% for ethanol production at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V with as is stable for 130&#8197;h.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pt NiNC&#8208;Supported PtNi Nanoalloy Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts&#8212;In Situ Tracking of the Atomic Alloying Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
During thermal annealing treatment, carbon&#8208;encapsulated Ni NPs, rather than NiNx single sites, serve exclusively as the Ni atom source for PtNi alloy formation. Despite this low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional, carbon&#8208;supported 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%Pt Pt&#8208;loaded benchmark PtNi alloy catalysts.







Abstract
We report and analyze a synthetic strategy toward low&#8208;Pt platinum&#8208;nickel (Pt&#8208;Ni) alloy nanoparticle (NP) cathode catalysts for the catalytic electroreduction of molecular oxygen to water. The synthesis involves the pyrolysis and leaching of Ni&#8208;organic polymers, subsequent Pt NP deposition, followed by thermal alloying, resulting in single Ni atom site (NiNC)&#8208;supported PtNi alloy NPs at low Pt weight loadings of only 3&#8211;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Despite low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;% benchmark PtNi catalysts. Using in situ microscopic techniques, we track and unravel the key stages of the PtNi alloy formation process directly at the atomic scale. Surprisingly, we find that carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Ni@C structures, rather than NiNx sites, act as the Ni source during alloy formation.

&lt;p&gt;During thermal annealing treatment, carbon-encapsulated Ni NPs, rather than NiN&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; single sites, serve exclusively as the Ni atom source for PtNi alloy formation. Despite this low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt-mass activities compared to conventional, carbon-supported 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt; Pt-loaded benchmark PtNi alloy catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report and analyze a synthetic strategy toward low-Pt platinum-nickel (Pt-Ni) alloy nanoparticle (NP) cathode catalysts for the catalytic electroreduction of molecular oxygen to water. The synthesis involves the pyrolysis and leaching of Ni-organic polymers, subsequent Pt NP deposition, followed by thermal alloying, resulting in single Ni atom site (NiNC)-supported PtNi alloy NPs at low Pt weight loadings of only 3&#8211;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Despite low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt-mass activities compared to conventional 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;% benchmark PtNi catalysts. Using in situ microscopic techniques, we track and unravel the key stages of the PtNi alloy formation process directly at the atomic scale. Surprisingly, we find that carbon-encapsulated metallic Ni@C structures, rather than NiN&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; sites, act as the Ni source during alloy formation. Our materials concepts offer a pathway to further decrease the overall Pt content in hydrogen fuel cell cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Proapoptotic Activity of a Phosphoric&#8208;Acid&#8208;Tethered Tetraphenylethene by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Isomerization and Switchable Protein Interactions for Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered trans&#8208;cis isomerization of a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene can be tuned by interaction with albumin. The trans and cis isomers show different interactions toward alkaline phosphatase and albumin, and have different cellular uptake efficiency and proapoptotic activity. Thus, on&#8208;demand activating and deactivating the proapoptotic effect has been achieved in vitro and in vivo by using visible light and proteins as switching elements.







Abstract
We herein report a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene (T&#8208;P) capable of adapting its geometric configuration and biological activity to the microenvironment upon light irradiation for apoptosis modulation. Different from most ultraviolet&#8208;responsive isomerization, T&#8208;P undergoes cis&#8208;trans isomerization under visible light irradiation, which is biocompatible and thus photo&#8208;modulation is possible in living biosystems. By using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin as dual targets, T&#8208;P isomers display different protein binding selectivity, cancer&#8208;cell internalization efficiency and apoptosis&#8208;inducing ability. The proapoptotic activity was found to be kinetically controlled by the enzymatic reaction with ALP and regulated by co&#8208;existing albumin. Motivated by these findings, two&#8208;way modulation of proapoptotic effect and on&#8208;demand boosting anticancer efficacy were realized in vitro and in vivo using light and endogenous proteins as multiple non&#8208;invasive switching stimuli.

         <title>Creating Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Defective Boron Carbon Nitride for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;controlled boron carbon nitride (BCN) is synthesized with electron&#8208;deficient B atoms and electron&#8208;rich N atoms in defects, forming frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to promote the electrocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on metal&#8208;free catalysts is an attractive alternative to the industrial Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts still suffer from low Faraday efficiencies and low ammonia yields. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy to develop a defective boron carbon nitride (BCN) catalyst with the abundant unsaturated B and N atoms as Lewis acid and base sites, which upgrades the catalyst from a single &#8220;Lewis acid catalysis&#8221; to &#8220;frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysis.&#8221; 14N2/15N2 exchange experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FLPs can adsorb an N2 molecule to form a six&#8208;membered ring intermediate, which enables the cleavage of N2 via a pull&#8211;pull effect, thereby significantly reducing the energy barrier to &#8722;0.28&#8197;eV. Impressively, BCN achieves a high Faraday efficiency of 18.9&#8201;%, an ammonia yield of 20.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat., and long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Pentacoordinated&#8208;Zirconium Catalyst with Axial Oxygen Ligand for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Zr&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with a stable pentacoordinated structure and high single&#8208;atom Zr loading is discovered. With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the assembled zinc&#8211;air battery delivers a record&#8208;high power density among those of single&#8208;atom catalyst&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), as promising alternatives to Pt&#8208;based catalysts, suffer from the limited choice of center metals and low single&#8208;atom loading. Here, we report a pentacoordinated Zr&#8208;based SAC with nontrivial axial O ligands (denoted O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The O ligand downshifts the d&#8208;band center of Zr and confers Zr sites with stable local structure and proper adsorption capability for intermediates. Consequently, the ORR performance of O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C prominently surpasses that of commercial Pt/C, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and outstanding durability (92&#8201;% current retention after 130&#8208;hour operation). Moreover, the Zr site shows good resistance towards aggregation, enabling the synthesis of Zr&#8208;based SAC with high loading (9.1&#8197;wt%). With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) delivers a record&#8208;high power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 among those of SAC&#8208;based ZABs.

         <dc:description>
The 3D analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraanthracene exists as a monomer in both the solid and solution state. It is thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of an azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, it is capable of E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge).







Abstract
Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) inorganic analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraantracene, which turned out to be a monomer in both the solid and solution state, and thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge) was investigated. While the reaction with B&#8722;H (9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) led directly to the 1,1&#8208;addition on N&#945; upon N2 elimination, the Si&#8722;H (Et3SiH, PhMe2SiH) activation proceeded stepwise via 1,2&#8208;addition, with the key intermediates 5int and 6int being isolated and characterized. In contrast, the cooperative Ge&#8722;H was reversible and stayed at the 1,2&#8208;addition step.

While the reaction with B&#8722;H (9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) led directly to the 1,1-addition on N&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt; upon N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elimination, the Si&#8722;H (Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH, PhMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiH) activation proceeded stepwise via 1,2-addition, with the key intermediates &lt;b&gt;5&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; being isolated and characterized. In contrast, the cooperative Ge&#8722;H was reversible and stayed at the 1,2-addition step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chimeric Conjugate of Antibody and Programmable DNA Nanoassembly Smartly Activates T Cells for Precise Cancer Cell Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chimeric antibody&#8208;nucleic acid T&#8208;cell engager (CAN&#8208;TE) redirecting T cells to precisely target and potently kill the cancer cells by coupling 1)&#8197;a dynamic DNA circuit with high&#8208;order logic function for smart cell recognition or 2)&#8197;a multivalent aptameric DNA nanostructure to control the targeting avidity for tunable immune response is reported.







Abstract
Synthetically directing T&#8208;cells against tumors emerges as a promising strategy in immunotherapy, while it remains challenging to smartly engage T cells with tunable immune response. Herein, we report an intelligent molecular platform to engineer T&#8208;cell recognition for selective activation to potently kill cancer cells. To this end, we fabricated a hybrid conjugate that uses a click&#8208;type DNA&#8211;protein conjugation to equip the T cell&#8208;engaging antibody with two distinct programmable DNA nanoassemblies. By integrating multiple aptameric antigen&#8208;recognitions within a dynamic DNA circuit, we achieved combinatorial recognition of triple&#8208;antigens on cancer cells for selective T&#8208;cell activation after high&#8208;order logic operation. Moreover, by coupling a DNA nanostructure, we precisely defined the valence of the antigen&#8208;binding aptamers to tune avidity, realizing effective tumor elimination in vitro and in vivo. Together, we present a versatile and programmable strategy for synthetic immunotherapy.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmable AgAuS&#8208;Primed Conductive Nanowelding Wires&#8208;Up Wet Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;based, DNA&#8208;programmable, and highly efficient nanowelding process generates conductive threads in self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle &#8220;molecules&#8221; and &#8220;polymers&#8221;. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific Ag2S deposition in pre&#8208;formed gold nanostructures. It ends with Ag2S&#8208;directed gold&#8208;atom diffusion and a reduction of the resulting AgAuS primer phase to give conductive Au/Ag alloyed junctions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials, directed by molecular or supramolecular interactions, is a powerful strategy to build nanoscale devices. Despite many advantages of such solution&#8208;based processes, a big challenge is to realize interparticle ohmic contacts toward facilitated charge transport over a long distance. We report a new concept of primed nanowelding to thread solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles in prescribed assemblies. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific deposition of Ag2E (E=S, Se) materials in pre&#8208;assembled gold structures, which spontaneously transform into AgAuE semiconductors via directional gold diffusion. Treatment with tributylphosphine generates alloyed Au/Ag welding spots that conductively wire&#8208;up nanoparticles into discrete &#8220;molecules&#8221; and micron&#8208;long &#8220;polymers&#8221;. This method is compatible with DNA programming and delivers a possible way to solve the problem of the carrier&#8208;transport dilemma in solution&#8208;processed nanostructures for better&#8208;functioning nanodevices.

         <title>Consequences of Noncovalent Interfacial Contacts between Nanoparticles and Giant Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticle interaction induces morphological changes in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) upon binding to surface&#8208;immobilized hCAII. Nanoparticle size, receptor/ligand surface densities, overall receptor/ligand concentrations, and ratios affect the strength of adhesion. Adhesion strength determines the interaction outcome, namely, weak/strong inter&#8208;GUV adhesion and GUV lysis.







Abstract
Biological membrane fluidity enables shape reform upon a functionally complementary encounter between a biomolecule and a synthetic nanoparticle. Nanomedicine uses ligand&#8208;cell surface receptor affinities for nanoparticle targeting. However, due to toxicity concerns, the nature of the nanoparticle&#8211;biomembrane interaction needs exploration to realize ligand surface density and receptor&#8211;ligand interaction effects on subsequent uptake/other interaction outcomes. In this study, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were surface&#8208;immobilized with a hCAII model receptor to study nanoparticle&#8211;complementary surface ligand interactions. We find interaction strength impacts morphological outcomes, namely, inter&#8208;GUV adhesion, lysis, and GUV swallowing. Nanoparticle size, receptor/ligand surface densities, overall receptor/ligand concentrations and ratios affect the strength of adhesion, and thus the outcome. Interaction energy effects on GUV morphological outcomes offer fundamental insights into the design of abiological materials for interacting with biological materials.

Highly enantioselective inter&#8208; and intramolecular Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkoxycarbonylation yields various enantioenriched polysubstituted cyclopropanecarboxylic derivatives with quaternary carbon stereocenters.







Abstract
The asymmetric Reppe carbonylation reactions provide a straightforward access to &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The reported paradigms predominantly adopted precious palladium as the catalyst. Here we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonylation of cyclopropenes with phenyl formate and CO/ROH, respectively. This asymmetrical synthetic protocol features high atom economy, good functional group tolerance, which rapidly constructs polysubstituted cyclopropanecarboxylic derivatives with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by facile conversion of the chiral products into bioactive molecules such as (&#8722;)&#8208;Tranylcypromine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Lemborexant.

A three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) is prepared as a membrane for highly permselective and robust organic solvent nanofiltration. The membrane has an unprecedented methanol permeance. High&#8208;performance purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients is also realized by the 3D COF membrane.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) has become increasingly important in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, demanding superior and robust membranes. Herein, we report advanced OSN processes by designing three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes through moderated interfacial crystallization. Nanoporous supports work as the moderator allowing the crystallization of 3D COF membranes. The 3D COF features sub&#8208;nanometer and anti&#8208;swelling channels, affording a sharp selectivity to fine targets with an exceptionally high and stable methanol permeance. Thus&#8208;synthesized membrane exhibits a record stability against high&#8208;concentration feeds and long&#8208;term operation for &#8776;1000&#8197;h. Moreover, we unambiguously demonstrate that our membrane holds excellent practicality in purifying active pharmaceutical ingredients from organic liquids. This work reveals the great potential of distinctive 3D COFs in producing prominent OSN membranes for industrial applications.

&lt;p&gt;Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) has become increasingly important in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, demanding superior and robust membranes. Herein, we report advanced OSN processes by designing three-dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes through moderated interfacial crystallization. Nanoporous supports work as the moderator allowing the crystallization of 3D COF membranes. The 3D COF features sub-nanometer and anti-swelling channels, affording a sharp selectivity to fine targets with an exceptionally high and stable methanol permeance. Thus-synthesized membrane exhibits a record stability against high-concentration feeds and long-term operation for &#8776;1000&#8197;h. Moreover, we unambiguously demonstrate that our membrane holds excellent practicality in purifying active pharmaceutical ingredients from organic liquids. This work reveals the great potential of distinctive 3D COFs in producing prominent OSN membranes for industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directed Dehydration as Synthetic Tool for Generation of a New Na4SnS4 Polymorph: Crystal Structure, Na+ Conductivity, and Influence of Sb&#8208;Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydration of Na4SnS4&#8901;14&#8201;H2O at moderate temperature generates the new, kinetically stabilized Na4SnS4 polymorph exhibiting enhanced ionic conductivities compared to the thermodynamically stabilized form. Co&#8208;decomposition with Na3SbS4&#8901;9&#8201;H2O enables an easy, fast, and scalable avenue to obtain the solid solution Na4&#8722;xSn1&#8722;xSbxS4 allowing methodical investigations of Sb&#8208;substitution effects in these solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
We present the convenient synthesis and characterization of the new ternary thiostannate Na4SnS4 (space group 
) by directed removal of crystal water molecules from Na4SnS4&#8901;14&#8201;H2O. The compound represents a new kinetically stable polymorph of Na4SnS4, which is transformed into the known, thermodynamically stable form (space group 
) at elevated temperatures. Thermal co&#8208;decomposition of mixtures with Na3SbS4&#8901;9&#8201;H2O generates solid solution products Na4&#8722;xSn1&#8722;xSbxS4 (x=0.01, 0.10) isostructural to the new polymorph (x=0). Incorporation of Sb5+ affects the bonding and local structural situation noticeably evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, 119Sn and 23Na NMR, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates an enormous improvement of the ionic conductivity with increasing Sb content for the solid solution (&#963;25&#176;C=2&#215;10&#8722;3, 2&#215;10&#8722;2, and 0.1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for x=0, 0.01, and 0.10), being several orders of magnitude higher than for the known Na4SnS4 polymorph.

         <title>Efficient Production of L&#8208;Homophenylalanine by Enzymatic&#8208;Chemical Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route involving both enzymatic and spontaneous chemical reactions was designed for the synthesis of L&#8208;homophenylalanine from inexpensive building blocks. One enzyme in the cascade, EcQOR, was identified as the first ene reductase to catalyze the reduction of an unsaturated aromatic keto acid. This study shows the potential of introducing spontaneous chemical reactions into enzymatic cascades for the synthesis of valuable chemicals.







Abstract
L&#8208;Homophenylalanine (L&#8208;HPA) is a vital building block for the synthesis of numerous chiral drugs. However, the high cost of starting materials limits the industrial production of L&#8208;HPA. In this study, an enzymatic&#8208;spontaneous chemical cascade route for L&#8208;HPA production was designed based on retrosynthetic analysis. This route, using simple benzaldehyde and pyruvate as starting materials, is extremely cost&#8208;effective. The enzymes were screened and further assembled in E.&#8197;coli, and TipheDH was identified as the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme. Therefore, TipheDH was engineered to improve its specific activity (by 82&#8201;%) and expression level (by 254&#8201;%), thus generating the best strain (W14). W14 exhibited the optimum enzyme activity ratio (1.7&#8201;:&#8201;1.1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1.8) and demonstrated production of 100.9&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 of L&#8208;HPA (with 94&#8201;% conversion, &gt;99&#8201;% ee) in a 5&#8208;L reactor. This route effectively exploits the power of cascades and offers insight into avenues for synthesizing other valuable chemicals from inexpensive building blocks.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective Radical Trifluoromethylation of Benzamide Derivatives via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives was developed that makes use of iminium intermediates. The iminium species, formed in situ from Tf2O, pyridine and amides, feature greatly enhanced reactivity at the para&#8208;position towards radical&#8208;type nucleophilic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes via a radical pathway has attracted considerable attention recently. However, a major challenge of C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation is the lack of site&#8208;selectivity on the phenyl ring especially para&#8208;selectivity. Herein we show a new strategy for para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives using iminium activation. The reaction undergoes a radical&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution instead of a radical&#8208;type electrophilic substitution owing to iminium activation as a result of lowering the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital). A wide range of substrates are compatible with this method giving almost exclusive para&#8208;trifluoromethylated products.

         <title>Dual Reactivity of a Geometrically Constrained Phosphenium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometrically constrained phosphenium cation 1+ was synthesized and its reactivity was studied. While 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH via P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path, its reaction with Et3SiH proceeds via oxidative addition type reaction affording new PV intermediate. The ability of 1+ to activate Si&#8722;H bond was tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.







Abstract
A geometrically constrained phosphenium cation in bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine based NNN pincer type ligand (1+) was synthesized, isolated and its preliminary reactivity was studied with small molecules. 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH, activating the O&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds via a P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path. The reaction of 1+ with one equiv. of H3NBH3 leads to its dehydrogenation producing 5. Interestingly, reaction of 1+ with an excess H3NBH3 leads to phosphinidene (PI) species coordinating to two BH3 molecules (6). In contrast, [1+][OTf] reacts with Et3SiH by hydride abstraction yielding 1&#8208;H and Et3SiOTf, while [1+][B(C6F5)4] reacts with Et3SiH via an oxidative addition type reaction of Si&#8722;H bond to P&#8208;center, affording a new PV compound (8). However, 8 is not stable over time and degrades to a complex mixture of compounds in matter of minutes. Despite this, the ability of [1+][B(C6F5)4] to activate Si&#8722;H bond could still be tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;A geometrically constrained phosphenium cation in bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine based NNN pincer type ligand (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized, isolated and its preliminary reactivity was studied with small molecules. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; reacts with MeOH and Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH, activating the O&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds via a P-center/ligand assisted path. The reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with one equiv. of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; leads to its dehydrogenation producing &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Interestingly, reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with an excess H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; leads to phosphinidene (P&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;) species coordinating to two BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). In contrast, [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;][OTf] reacts with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH by hydride abstraction yielding &lt;b&gt;1-H&lt;/b&gt; and Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiOTf, while [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] reacts with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH via an oxidative addition type reaction of Si&#8722;H bond to P-center, affording a new P&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; compound (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;). However, &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; is not stable over time and degrades to a complex mixture of compounds in matter of minutes. Despite this, the ability of [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Two Distinct Catalytic Sites Enables Fast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of organocatalysts featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule was illustrated in the ROCOP of epoxides with anhydride, giving excellent selectivity and activity. A chain tug&#8208;of&#8208;war mechanistic pathway is proposed to rationalize the simultaneous enhancement in monomer activation and nucleophilic attack, thus giving rise to outstanding catalytic performance.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations have emerged as a powerful approach towards the creation of sustainable polymers. Typical H&#8208;bonding catalysts for ring&#8208;opening are subject to a single catalytic site. Here we describe a H&#8208;bond&#8208;donor/Lewis&#8208;acidic&#8208;boron organocatalyst featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule. The ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides with anhydride mediated by these modular, and tunable catalysts achieves high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% polyester selectivity) and markedly higher activity compared to either of the di&#8208;thiourea analogues or any combinations of them. Calculations and experimental studies reveal that the superior catalytic performance arises from tug&#8208;of&#8208;war between two differentiated catalytic sites: thiourea pulls off the propagating chain&#8208;end from boron center, simultaneously enhancing the role of monomer activation and also nucleophilicity of the propagation intermediates.

         <title>Phenacyl Bromide as a Single&#8208;Component Photoinitiator: Photoinduced Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization of N&#8208;Methylpyrrole and N&#8208;Methylindole</title>

Photoinduced step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole and N&#8208;methylindole was accomplished using phenacyl bromide as single&#8208;component photoinitiator under near&#8208;UV irradiation.







Abstract
The synthesis of step&#8208;growth polymers by photoinduced methods is a challenging issue in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a single component near UV responsive photopolymerization system for step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole (MPyr) and N&#8208;methylindole (MIn) by using phenacyl bromide (PAB). The obtained high molecular weight conjugated polymers were characterized by spectral and chromatographic methods. Detailed laser flash photolysis and spectroscopic studies revealed that polymerization proceeds by successive photoinduced cleavage of PAB followed by electron transfer, proton release and coupling processes. After photolysis, chain growth continues also in daylight or dark by acidic oxidation. The structural features of the polymers were investigated. PAB single component photoinitiator enables an efficient, rapid, room temperature step&#8208;growth polymerization process of MPyr and MIn that can be applied to other conjugated monomers.

         <title>The Rational Design and Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral C2&#8208;Arylpyrrole&#8208;Derived Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile C1&#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold, NPNOL, has been rationally designed. For the enantioselective synthesis of NPNOL, the chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction was utilized. Density functional theory calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. NPNOL could serve as a new platform for the development of chiral ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl diols have achieved great success in asymmetric catalysis. By contrast, axially chiral biaryl amino alcohols are far less developed. Herein, we have rationally designed a versatile C1&#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold 1&#8208;(1&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NPNOL) on the basis of axially chiral C2&#8208;arylpyrrole framework. For its enantioselective synthesis, the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and azoalkenes had been established. By using this practical method, a wide range of NPNOLs were readily prepared in high yields and excellent atroposelectivities (38 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. The easy transformations of NPNOL&#8208;derived products into organocatalysts/ligands and their preliminary applications in asymmetric catalytic reactions demonstrated the promising utility of NPNOL.

         <title>BTDAzo: A Photoswitchable TRPC5 Channel Activator
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TRPs (Transient Receptor Potentials) are important sensory ion channels with roles in perception including of heat, cold, and electrophiles, as well as in signaling and mineralostasis. Here the first photopharmaceutical TRPC5 ligand, BTDAzo, is developed, which achieves outstanding photoswitchability of TRPC5 currents in physiological models including brain slice, without crosstalk to the related TRPC4 channel.







Abstract
Photoswitchable reagents can be powerful tools for high&#8208;precision biological control. TRPC5 is a Ca2+&#8208;permeable cation channel with distinct tissue&#8208;specific roles, from synaptic function to hormone regulation. Reagents giving spatiotemporally&#8208;resolved control over TRPC5 activity may be key to understanding and harnessing its biology. Here we develop the first photoswitchable TRPC5&#8208;modulator, BTDAzo, to address this goal. BTDAzo can photocontrol TRPC5 currents in cell culture, as well as controlling endogenous TRPC5&#8208;based neuronal Ca2+ responses in mouse brain slices. BTDAzos are also the first reported azo&#8208;benzothiadiazines, an accessible and conveniently derivatised azoheteroarene with strong two&#8208;colour photoswitching. BTDAzo&#8242;s ability to control TRPC5 across relevant channel biology settings makes it suitable for a range of dynamically reversible photoswitching studies in TRP channel biology, with the aim to decipher the various biological roles of this centrally important ion channel.

         <title>Monitoring Reaction Intermediates to Predict Enantioselectivity Using Mass Spectrometry
</title>

Diastereomeric intermediates can be separated by ion mobility mass spectrometry. Monitoring of the kinetics of the intermediates allows the prediction of the overall reaction enantioselectivity. The experiments can be performed in a small scale and do not require an isolation of the products.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions are at the core of chemical synthesis. Their development mostly relies on prior knowledge, laborious product analysis and post&#8208;rationalization by theoretical methods. Here, we introduce a simple and fast method to determine enantioselectivities based on mass spectrometry. The method is based on ion mobility separation of diastereomeric intermediates, formed from a chiral catalyst and prochiral reactants, and delayed reactant labeling experiments to link the mass spectra with the reaction kinetics in solution. The data provide rate constants along the reaction paths for the individual diastereomeric intermediates, revealing the origins of enantioselectivity. Using the derived kinetics, the enantioselectivity of the overall reaction can be predicted. Hence, this method can offer a rapid discovery and optimization of enantioselective reactions in the future. We illustrate the method for the addition of cyclopentadiene (CP) to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde catalyzed by a diarylprolinol silyl ether.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Fluctuations of Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in the Alzheimer's Disease Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger and a new NIR emissive Rhodol fluorophore, an activity&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probe for ONOO&#8722; in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was constructed. Real&#8208;time imaging of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice and age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mouse brains have been demonstrated with the probe.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To reveal the ONOO&#8722; influx in AD brains, an activatable activity&#8208;based fluorescence probe Rd&#8208;DPA3 was designed by a structure&#8208;modulated strategy. Taking advantage of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated two&#8208;step cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger, Rd&#8208;DPA3 specifically responds to ONOO&#8722; in 0.3&#8197;mM of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and varied proteins, and gives an intensive fluorescence enhancement (F/F0=50). Moreover, with its mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 can be used to efficiently monitor the alternations of intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels in cerebral cells during oxidative stress. Significantly, due to NIR emission and good blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 is suitable for in vivo imaging of cerebral ONOO&#8722; influx and illustrating an age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice brains.

         <title>A SLC35C2 Transporter&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probe for the Selective Detection of B Lymphocytes Identified by SLC&#8208;CRISPRi and Unbiased Fluorescence Library Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as the SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. Gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments confirmed that the SLC35C2 transporter acted as the target responsible for the selectivity of CDyB for B&#8208;cells over T&#8208;cells.







Abstract
T and B lymphocytes are two major adaptive immune cells in the human defense system. To real&#8208;time monitor their diverse functions, a live&#8208;cell&#8208;selective probe for only one cell type is need to investigate the complex interaction of the immune cells. Herein, a small&#8208;molecule probe CDyB for live B cells is developed by an unbiased fluorescence library screening. The cell selectivity was confirmed by multiparametric single&#8208;cell analysis using CyTOF. Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. The gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments validated that the SLC35C2 transporter was the target for CDyB distinction. Interestingly, when CDyB was applied to study B cell development, the CDyB fluorescence and SLC35C2 expression were positively correlated with the B cell maturation process, and not involved in the T cell development.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric &#945;&#8208;Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 Compounds with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity Originating from Ag9Te2 Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;temperature crystal structure of &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 shows a hexagonal structure. Highly disordered Ag atoms vibrate in&#8208;harmonically leading to an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. All these factors contribute to an improved thermoelectric Figure of Merit ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6.







Abstract
We have determined the complex atomic structure of high&#8208;temperature &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 phase with a hexagonal lattice (P63mc space group, a=b=8.2766&#8197;&#197;, c=13.4349&#8197;&#197;). The structure has outer [GaTe4]5&#8722; tetrahedrons and inner [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. All of the Ag ions are disorderly distributed in the lattice. Seven types of the Ag atoms constitute the cage&#8208;like [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. The highly disordered Ag ions vibrate in&#8208;harmonically, producing strong coupling between low frequency optical phonons and acoustic phonons. This in conjunction with a low sound velocity of 1354&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 leads to an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.20&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 673&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. Ag9Ga0.91Te6 attains a highest power factor of 0.40&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. All these contribute to a much&#8208;improved ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6, which is 41&#8201;% higher than that of the pristine Ag9GaTe6 sample.

         <title>Highly Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective hydroboration of unsymmetrical internal alkynes featuring unique regioselectivity, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility was realized by using cobalt catalysts modified with newly developed cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands. The current protocol enabled the synthesis of novel alkenyl borates and improved the synthetic efficiency of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of new Co complexes that have cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands and can catalyze highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective hydroboration reactions of unsymmetrical internal alkynes. These reactions exhibited unusual regioselectivity: specifically, reactions of aryl alkyl internal alkynes showed excellent cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;addition selectivity, and reactions of dialkyl internal alkynes gave excellent cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;addition selectivity. Highly regioselective hydroboration of unsymmetrical dialkyl internal alkynes cannot be achieved by other known methods. The reactions described herein are highly synthetically useful, particularly for the stereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenylborates and alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a CoI&#8722;H species is a plausible active catalyst and the rigid structure of the cyclopropane skeleton of the ligands and the crowded reaction pocket were responsible for the unprecedented regioselectivity.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Covalent TMP&#8208;Tag for Fast Labeling and Multiplexed Imaging of Cellular Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The third&#8208;generation TMP&#8208;tag3 is developed. It features optimized synthesis, fluorogenic labeling, and fast cellular intake. It performs well in comparative studies with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. The 18&#8197;kD&#8208;protein tag is compatible with loop insertion. The TMP&#8208;tag3 supplements and supplants the existing self&#8208;labeling protein tags, adding an orthogonal channel for multiplexed labeling and nanoscopic imaging.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling protein tags can introduce advanced molecular motifs to specific cellular proteins. Here we introduce the third&#8208;generation covalent TMP&#8208;tag (TMP&#8208;tag3) and showcase its comparison with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. TMP&#8208;tag3 is based on a proximity&#8208;induced covalent Michael addition between an engineered Cys of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and optimized trimethoprim (TMP)&#8211;acrylamide conjugates with minimal linkers. Compared to previous versions, the TMP&#8208;tag3 features an enhanced permeability when conjugated to fluorogenic spirocyclic rhodamines. As a small protein, the 18&#8208;kD eDHFR is advantageous in tagging selected mitochondrial proteins which are less compatible with bulkier HaloTag fusions. The proximal N&#8722;C termini of eDHFR also enable facile insertion into various protein loops. TMP&#8208;tag3, HaloTag, and SNAP&#8208;tag are orthogonal to each other, collectively forming a toolbox for multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular proteins under fluorescence nanoscopy.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling in Catalytic Hydrolysis and Alcoholysis of Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;giant&#8221; kinetic isotope effect (KIE=346) has been observed for the generation of hydrogen from the hydrolysis of silanes catalyzed by a silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex. This and other experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations have been used to demonstrate the participation of hydrogen quantum tunneling in this catalytic process.







Abstract
An unprecedented quantum tunneling effect has been observed in catalytic Si&#8722;H bond activations at room temperature. The cationic hydrido&#8208;silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex, {Ir[SiMe(o&#8208;C6H4SMe)2](H)(PPh3)(THF)}[BArF4], has proven to be a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and the alcoholysis of organosilanes. When triethylsilane was used as a substrate, the system revealed the largest kinetic isotopic effect (KIESi&#8722;H/Si&#8722;D=346&#177;4) ever reported for this type of reaction. This unexpectedly high KIE, measured at room temperature, together with the calculated Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio (AH/AD=0.0004) and difference in the observed activation energy [(E
&#8722;E
)=34.07&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1] are consistent with the participation of quantum tunneling in the catalytic process. DFT calculations have been used to unravel the reaction pathway and identify the rate&#8208;determining step. Aditionally, isotopic effects were considered by different methods, and tunneling effects have been calculated to be crucial in the process.

         <title>Construction of Benzocyclobutenes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Triplet Biradical Atom Transfer of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzocyclobutanol and benzocyclobutylamine derivatives have been obtained by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced triplet biradical atom transfer of olefins. The reaction mechanism was investigated by deuterium&#8208;labeling and kinetic quenching experiments, as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a method that provides an array of benzocyclobutanol and benzocyclobutylamine derivatives with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeds by engaging triplet biradical atom transfer of olefinic compounds in the activation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction mechanism involves the generation of triplet excited state of diarylethylene derivative and subsequent HAT process, and then the further ring&#8208;closing reaction affording the product via an electrocyclization process. The plausible mechanism is supported by control and deuterium labeling experiments, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O Perovskite for Flexible Transparent X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O perovskites are prepared that have multiple hydrogen bonds which improve the lattice stiffness for better endurance of X&#8208;ray radiation. Importantly, the flexible X&#8208;ray detector realizes the highest sensitivity of 3708&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with improved operational stability and has potential in pixelated matrix imaging.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites are of interest for their chemical diversity and eco&#8208;friendly properties, and recently have been used for X&#8208;ray detection with superior carrier behavior. However, the size and shape complexity of the organic components results in difficulties in evaluating their stability in high&#8208;energy radiation. Herein, we introduce multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O perovskite, where H2O leads to more hydrogen bonds appearing between organic molecules and the perovskite host. As suggested by the theoretical calculations, multiple hydrogen bonds promote stiffness of the lattice, and increase the diffusion barrier to inhibit ionic migration. Then, low trap density, high &#956;&#964; products and structural flexibility of PAZE&#8208;NH4Br3&#8901;H2O give a flexible X&#8208;ray detector with the highest sensitivity of 3708&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 0.19&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and superior spatial resolution of 5.0&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with improved operational stability and has potential in pixelated matrix imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-free perovskites are of interest for their chemical diversity and eco-friendly properties, and recently have been used for X-ray detection with superior carrier behavior. However, the size and shape complexity of the organic components results in difficulties in evaluating their stability in high-energy radiation. Herein, we introduce multiple hydrogen-bond metal-free PAZE-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O perovskite, where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O leads to more hydrogen bonds appearing between organic molecules and the perovskite host. As suggested by the theoretical calculations, multiple hydrogen bonds promote stiffness of the lattice, and increase the diffusion barrier to inhibit ionic migration. Then, low trap density, high &lt;i&gt;&#956;&#964;&lt;/i&gt; products and structural flexibility of PAZE-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O give a flexible X-ray detector with the highest sensitivity of 3708&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ultra-low detection limit of 0.19&#8197;&#956;Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and superior spatial resolution of 5.0&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sunk&#8208;Cost Bias and Knowing When to Terminate a Research Project</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An awareness of sunk&#8208;cost bias provides an antidote to the scientific optimism that exacerbates the tendency to continue research projects when the likelihood of success is minimal. A survey of academic and industrial practices, as summarized in the sunk&#8208;cost bias decision matrix, captures how implementing controls facilitates data&#8208;driven decisions to terminate or continue research while avoiding emotionally driven decisions that can sap resources.







Abstract
Scientific research is an open&#8208;ended quest where success usually triumphs over failure. The tremendous success of science obscures the tendency for the non&#8208;linear discovery process to take longer and cost more than expected. Perseverance through detours and past setbacks requires a significant commitment that is fueled by scientific optimism; the same optimism required to overcome challenges simultaneously exacerbates the very human tendency to continue a line of inquiry when the likelihood of success is minimal, the so&#8208;called sunk&#8208;cost bias. This Viewpoint Article shows how the psychological phenomenon of sunk&#8208;cost bias influences medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists by comparing how the respective industrial and academic practitioners approach sunk&#8208;cost bias; a series of interviews and illustrative quotes provide a rich trove of data to address this seldom discussed, yet potentially avoidable research cost. The concluding strategies recommended for mitigating against sunk&#8208;cost bias should benefit not only medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists but a wide array of chemistry practitioners.

Ring&#8208;current strengths are a useful aromaticity measure that is obtained indirectly through the ring&#8208;current model using experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data. The computation of ring currents provides direct visual aid and reveals that the ring&#8208;current model overestimates the ring&#8208;current strength of large molecular rings. Ring&#8208;current plots show that c&#8208;P6[b6]&#8901;T66+ (left) is much less aromatic than benzene (right).







Abstract
A recent article by Anderson and co&#8208;workers challenges our conclusions on the aromaticity of the four oxidation states of a butadyine&#8208;linked six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring, based on the experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data and some recent calculations they have performed using the BLYP35 functional. Here, we show that BLYP35 should be taken with caution and demonstrate that the indirect evidence of a ring current from experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data is not a definite proof of aromaticity.

Porphyrin nanoring template complexes provide a wealth of experimental NMR spectroscopy data, which are sensitive to global ring currents and which can be used to answer this question. Both experiment and theory confirm that nanoring cations are globally (anti)aromatic based on magnetic shielding evidence, and consistent with H&#252;ckel's rule.







Abstract
A recent Research Article in this journal by Matito and co&#8208;workers claimed that none of the oxidation states of a butadiyne&#8208;linked six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring exhibit global aromaticity or antiaromaticity. Here we show that this conclusion is incorrect. Experimental data from NMR spectroscopy for a whole family of nanorings provide strong evidence for global ring currents. The NMR data reveal these ring currents directly, without needing analysis by density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, DFT calculations reproduce the experimental results when a suitable functional is used.

An efficient polyelectrolyte hole&#8208;transport layer was explored for 2D perovskite solar cells by using a compatible butylamine cation, as reported by Jianyu Yuan and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202205111). The tailored polyelectrolyte has an anchoring effect and acts as a passivator for 2D perovskites, which can improve 2D perovskite phase alignment and interfacial charge transfer efficiency, and finally enables high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area 2D perovskite solar cells.

Flying elephants and delicate cargo. Electrospray ionization of proteins has been likened to making molecular elephants fly. In their Communication (e202202075), Helen&#8197;J. Cooper and co&#8208;workers demonstrate mass spectrometry detection and imaging of a non&#8208;covalent complex formed in&#8197;vivo, comprising an endogenous protein and an exogenously administered drug molecule, directly from liver tissue. These methods will provide greater insight into protein&#8211;drug complexes in support of drug research and development.

         <title>Cover Picture: A Stable and Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Isolated Active Sites for Highly Selective Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 36/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO2 to acetate provides a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and store renewable energy, but acetate is usually a by&#8208;product. A covalent organic framework with isolated active sites for the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to acetate is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202206470). The copper&#8211;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH3 with CO2 to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.

Atomically precise doping is a promising approach for functionalizing gold superatoms. In their Research Article (e202207290), Tatsuya Tsukuda and co&#8208;workers synthesized a series of M@Au12 superatoms (M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ir) and investigated their photophysical and photochemical properties. Doping an M element positioned at the lower left of the periodic table led to a remarkable enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield and photocatalytic activities for intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenone.

         <title>Spotting Trends in Organocatalyzed and Other Organomediated (De)polymerizations and Polymer Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest trends in polymer synthesis, depolymerization, and postpolymerization functionalization are reviewed, whereby organocatalysis and other organomediated methods take center stage. With today's growing emphasis on sustainability, we describe how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies offer fresh opportunities to access novel functional materials and also to valorize postconsumer plastic waste.







Abstract
Organocatalysis has evolved into an effective complement to metal&#8208; or enzyme&#8208;based catalysis in polymerization, polymer functionalization, and depolymerization. The ease of removal and greater sustainability of organocatalysts relative to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based ones has spurred development in specialty applications, e.g., medical devices, drug delivery, optoelectronics. Despite this, the use of organocatalysis and other organomediated reactions in polymer chemistry is still rapidly developing, and we envisage their rapidly growing application in nascent areas such as controlled radical polymerization, additive manufacturing, and chemical recycling in the coming years. In this Review, we describe ten trending areas where we anticipate paradigm shifts resulting from novel organocatalysts and other transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. We highlight opportunities and challenges and detail how new discoveries could lead to previously inaccessible functional materials and a potentially circular plastics economy.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Monohydrosilane: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monohydrosilanes, which bear a Si&#8722;H bond, have been widely leveraged as chiral reagents for alcohol resolution, chiral auxiliaries, mechanistic probes, as well as potential optoelectronic materials. This Minireview comprehensively summarizes the synthesis and synthetic applications of silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, particularly the advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
Optically active organosilanes have been demonstrated to be versatile chiral reagents in synthetic chemistry since the early seminal contributions by Sommer and Corriu. Among these silicon&#8208;containing chiral architectures, monohydrosilanes, which bear a Si&#8722;H bond, hold a unique position because of their facile transformations through stereospecific Si&#8211;carbon or Si&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;formation reactions. In addition, those compounds have also been leveraged as chiral reagents for alcohol resolution, chiral auxiliaries, mechanistic probes, as well as potential optoelectronic materials. This Minireview comprehensively summarizes the synthesis and synthetic applications of silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, particularly the advances in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of this class of functional molecules.

         <title>Azo Compounds as Active Materials of Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azo&#8208;containing compounds are promising active materials for rechargeable batteries and anolytes for redox flow batteries. The interaction between the N=N group and the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, the introduction of insoluble carboxylate groups, and polymerization lead to excellent battery performances. Azo molecules also showed excellent performance as both aqueous and organic anolyte of redox flow batteries.







Abstract
The rapid evolution of electrical devices and the increasing demand for the supply of sustainable energy necessitate the development of high&#8208;performance energy storage systems such as rechargeable and redox flow batteries. However, these batteries typically contain inorganic active materials, which exhibit several critical drawbacks hindering further development. In this regard, azo compounds are promising alternatives, offering the benefits of fast kinetics, multi&#8208;electron redox reactions, and tunable (via structural adjustment) battery performance. Herein, we review the use of azo compounds as the active materials of rechargeable and redox flow batteries, discuss certain aspects of material design and electrochemical reaction mechanisms, and summarize the corresponding perspectives and research directions to facilitate further progress in this field.

         <title>In Operando Visualization and Dynamic Manipulation of Electrochemical Processes at the Electrode&#8211;Solution Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in operando visualization method for investigating the dynamic processes occurring at the electrode&#8211;solution interface at the mesoscale is demonstrated. A novel microfabricated electrochemical cell (MEC) combined with a laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) fluorescence detection system was developed to observe high&#8208;resolution and fast&#8208;response ion accumulation and depletion in the diffusion layer.







Abstract
Revealing the dynamic processes at the electrode&#8211;solution interface is imperative for understanding electrochemical phenomena. Most techniques have been developed to sense the electrode surface changes at the nanoscale, but provide limited information on potential&#8208;induced interfacial ion redistribution at the mesoscale. Herein, we present an in operando visualization method utilizing a microfabricated electrochemical cell combined with a laser scanning confocal microscope to observe high&#8208;resolution and fast&#8208;response interfacial processes. We report potential&#8208;induced formation and transformation of the Nernst diffusion layer, demonstrating that pulsed voltage dynamically perturbs the interface and promotes ion diffusion. This provides an additional insight into developing a dynamic manipulation method to control the electrochemical process. Our novel visualization method can easily be applied to monitor different ionic behaviors in electrochemical reactions at the mesoscale.

Chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions are used for the first time to organize photoreactive systems, here (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules, into rectangular motifs favoring cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of strong and directional ChB donors such as selenocyanate moieties toward topochemical reactions.







Abstract
The face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules into rectangular motifs stabilized for the first time by chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions is shown to provide photoreactive systems leading to cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations. The chelating chalcogen bond donors are based on original aromatic, ortho&#8208;substituted bis(selenocyanato)benzene derivatives 1&#8211;3, prepared from ortho&#8208;diboronic acid bis(pinacol) ester precursors and SeO2 and malononitrile in 75&#8211;90&#8201;% yield. The very short intramolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se distance in 1&#8211;3 (3.22&#8211;3.24&#8197;&#197;), a consequence of a strong intramolecular ChB interaction, expands to 3.52&#8211;3.54&#8197;&#197; in the chalcogen&#8208;bonded adducts with bpen, a distance (&lt;4&#8197;&#197;) well adapted to the face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of the bpen molecules into the reactive position toward photochemical dimerization.

A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene ligand enables the isolation of thermally stable two&#8208;legged parent piano&#8208;stool Fe0 and Ru0 complexes. The iron complex reacts with P4 and As4 to yield mixed diborabenzene&#8208;cyclo&#8208;E4 sandwich complexes with planar E42&#8722; ligands. Computational analyses confirm the strong electron&#8208;donating capacity of the DBB ligand and show that the E4 ligand is bound by four equivalent Fe&#8722;P &#963; bonds.

         <title>H2O2&#8208;Responsive NIR&#8208;II AIE Nanobomb for Carbon Monoxide Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The upregulated expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) impairs the therapeutic efficacy of photothermal therapy (PTT). Inhibition of HSPs repair is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. The AIE nanobomb PBPTV@mPEG(CO) could be triggered by the over&#8208;expressed hydrogen peroxide in the tumor microenvironment and release CO to inhibit the upregulated expression of HSPs during low&#8208;temperature PTT to enhance the antitumor efficiency.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT), which circumvents the limitations of conventional PTT (e.g., thermotolerance and adverse effects), is an emerging therapeutic strategy which shows great potential for future clinical applications. The expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) can dramatically impair the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Thus, inhibition of HSPs repair and reducing the damage of nearby normal cells is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. Herein, we developed a nanobomb based on the self&#8208;assembly of NIRII AIE polymer PBPTV and carbon monoxide (CO) carrier polymer mPEG(CO). This smart nanobomb can be exploded in a tumor microenvironment in which hydrogen peroxide is overexpressed and release CO into cancer cells to significantly inhibit the expression of HSPs and hence improve the antitumor efficiency of the low&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries Using a Urea&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Kinetically Favorable One&#8208;Electron Li2O2 Oxidation Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) is proposed for lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Benefiting from its strong Li+&#8208;solvating ability and the absence of &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms, a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can occur in the charge process, and the hydrogen extraction side reactions can be effectively suppressed. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs exhibit a low charge overpotential and a long cycle life.







Abstract
Glymes are the most widely used electrolyte solvents in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) due to their relatively high stability. However, their associated LOBs have long been plagued by large charge overpotential, which is closely related to the sluggish two&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation mechanism. Here, we report a new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) for LOBs with high performance and an alternative mechanism, where a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can happen in the urea electrolyte system, thus leading to a much lower charge overpotential (&#8776;0.51&#8197;V) compared to the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (&#8776;1.27&#8197;V). Besides, TMU also exhibits good stability since it does not contain any &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms that are vulnerable to be attacked by superoxide species, thus suppressing the hydrogen abstraction side reactions. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs can stably work for more than 135&#8197;cycles, which is four times that of the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (&#8776;28&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Synergy of Weakly&#8208;Solvated Electrolyte and Optimized Interphase Enables Graphite Anode Charge at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte and a high&#8208;quality SEI by room&#8208;temperature formation process, which enables graphite electrode with a fast&#8208;charging 6C&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature operation. Moreover, the Gr||LiFePO4 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of 78&#8201;% at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and a high discharge capacity of 37&#8201;% even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Graphite anode suffers from great capacity loss and even fails to charge (i.e. Li+&#8208;intercalation) under low temperature, mainly arising from the large overpotential including sluggish de&#8208;solvation process and insufficient ions movement in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an electrolyte is developed by utilizing weakly solvated molecule ethyl trifluoroacetate and film&#8208;forming fluoroethylene carbonate to achieve smooth de&#8208;solvation and high ionic conductivity at low temperature. Evolution of SEI formed at different temperatures is further investigated to propose an effective room&#8208;temperature SEI formation strategy for low&#8208;temperature operations. The synergetic effect of tamed electrolyte and optimized SEI enables graphite with a reversible charge/discharge capacity of 183&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and fast&#8208;charging up to 6C&#8208;rate at room temperature. Moreover, graphite||LiFePO4 full cell maintains a capacity retention of 78&#8201;% at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, and 37&#8201;% even at a super&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a progressive insight towards fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel functionalized hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) has hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies and uses polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features allow rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell.







Abstract
The construction of responsive antimicrobial carriers with multifunctional and controllable release is an attractive but challenging proposition. Recently developed hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) offers structural advantages, such as easily modifiable surfaces and mutually influenced shells. Herein, we report a novel pH&#8208;responsive antimicrobial carrier having hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features are present in the form of rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell by electrostatic interaction, resulting in a long&#8208;lasting mildew resistance for up to 71&#8197;days. The versatility of the hierarchical interactions of HoMSs will inspire the design of promising smart drug carriers.

         <title>Drug Repurposing by Siderophore Conjugation: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Siderophore&#8208;Methotrexate Conjugates as Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of methotrexate (Mtx) with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterial conjugates is reported. The most potent conjugate exhibited over 1000&#8208;fold improved activity against Gram&#8208;positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram&#8208;negative Yersinia enterocolitica compared with Mtx, while possessing 2313&#8208;fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;106&#8208;fold improvements in the therapeutic index.







Abstract
Drug repurposing is considered a promising strategy to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Methotrexate (Mtx), a classical anticancer drug, could strongly inhibit bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). However, its poor permeability into bacteria and potent human cytotoxicity make it unsuitable as an antibacterial. Herein, we reported the conjugation of Mtx with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterials. The most potent conjugate 8 with nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values exhibited over 1.00&#215;103&#8208;fold improved activity against Gram&#8208;positive Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Gram&#8208;negative Yersinia enterocolitica (Y. enterocolitica) compared with Mtx, while possessing 2.31&#215;103&#8208;fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;106&#8208;fold improvements in the therapeutic index. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study verifies that siderophore conjugation is an effective strategy for developing new antibacterials from anticancer drugs.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Detection and Imaging of a Non&#8208;Covalent Protein&#8211;Drug Complex in Tissue from Orally Dosed Rats</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intact protein&#8211;drug complex formed in vivo between endogenous liver fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and the small molecule therapeutic bezafibrate was detected in ex vivo liver tissue from orally dosed rats by native ambient mass spectrometry. The spatial distribution of the protein&#8211;drug complex was imaged by nanospray desorption electrospray ionization.







Abstract
Here, we demonstrate detection by mass spectrometry of an intact protein&#8211;drug complex directly from liver tissue from rats that had been orally dosed with the drug. The protein&#8211;drug complex comprised fatty acid binding protein 1, FABP1, non&#8208;covalently bound to the small molecule therapeutic bezafibrate. Moreover, we demonstrate spatial mapping of the [FABP1+bezafibrate] complex across a thin section of liver by targeted mass spectrometry imaging. This work is the first demonstration of in situ mass spectrometry analysis of a non&#8208;covalent protein&#8211;drug complex formed in vivo and has implications for early stage drug discovery by providing a route to target&#8208;drug characterization directly from the physiological environment.

         <title>A Stable and Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Isolated Active Sites for Highly Selective Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to multiple active sites, an isolated active site with high electron density may be more suitable for electroreduction of CO2 towards the C2 product acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to acetate provides a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and store renewable energy, but acetate is usually a by&#8208;product. Here, we show a stable and conductive two&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) as an electrocatalyst for reduction of CO2 to acetate with a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3(2)% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and a current density of 12.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 solution. No obvious degradation was observed over 80&#8197;hours of continuous operation. Combined with the comparison of the properties of other catalysts with isolated metal active sites, theoretical calculations and in situ infrared spectroscopy revealed that the isolated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH3 with CO2 to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.

         <title>Crystal Structure Based Mutagenesis of Cattleyene Synthase Leads to the Generation of Rearranged Polycyclic Diterpenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the diterpene synthase CyS was solved, providing the structural basis for cattleyene biosynthesis. A CySC59A mutant generated diterpenes with novel carbon skeletons. The remarkable cyclization mechanism of one of these products was characterized by isotopic labeling experiments.







Abstract
The crystal structures of cattleyene synthase (apo&#8208;CyS), and CyS complexed with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) were solved. The CySC59A variant exhibited an increased production of cattleyene and other diterpenes with diverse skeletons. Its structure showed a widened active site cavity explaining the relaxed selectivity. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed a remarkable cyclization mechanism involving several skeletal rearrangements for one of the novel diterpenes.

         <title>Dearomative Ring Expansion of Polycyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A missing link between dearomative cyclopropanation and ring expansion of polycyclic (hetero)arenes has been established by utilizing an arenophile&#8208;based strategy. This two&#8208;step protocol enables the direct conversion of aromatic compounds into (aza)benzocycloheptatrienes, which are important structural motifs in natural products and biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Benzocycloheptenes constitute a common structural motif embedded in many natural products and biologically active compounds. Herein, we report their concise preparation from non&#8208;activated polycyclic arenes using a two&#8208;step sequence involving dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with arenophile in combination with palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation, followed by cycloreversion&#8208;initiated ring expansion. The described strategy provides a working alternative to the Buchner reaction, which is limited to monocyclic arenes. Overall, this methylene&#8208;insertion molecular editing approach enables rapid and direct conversion of simple (hetero)arenes into a range of substituted (aza)benzocycloheptatrienes, which can undergo a myriad of downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination of H2 Across a Gallium&#8208;Zinc Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrogen reversibly adds across the Ga&#8722;Zn bond of a heterobimetallic cation. Oxidative addition is favoured in THF solution where the hydrogenation products are stabilized, but in fluorobenzene, reductive elimination of H2 is promoted by the Lewis&#8208;acidic zinc hydride cation.







Abstract
H2 adds reversibly across the metal&#8208;metal bond of [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)(thf)][BAr4F] (BDI=[HC{C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)}2]&#8722;, TMEDA=N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, BAr4F&#8722;=[B(C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2)4]&#8722;). Due to the stabilising effect of solvent coordination, hydrogenation products [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(thf)][BAr4F] are favoured in THF solution, but THF&#8208;free mixtures of [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(OEt2)][BAr4F] are predisposed towards entropically driven dehydrogenation to [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)][BAr4F] in fluorobenzene solution.

         <title>A Mechanochemical, Catalyst&#8208;Free Cascade Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols and 1,4&#8208;Iodoalcohols Using Styrenes and Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient mechanochemical electrophilic functionalization reactions of unsaturated compounds with hypervalent iodine reagents have been developed. These green and sustainable mechanochemical protocols enable the synthesis of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized molecules that are otherwise difficult to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Our mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds in an intermolecular fashion.







Abstract
A mechanochemical and solvent/catalyst&#8208;free functionalization of olefins with hypervalent iodine reagents has been developed, enabling the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dioxygenated compounds. Under similar reaction conditions with the addition of molecular iodine, 1,4&#8208;iodoalcohols can be synthesized. These valuable products are non&#8208;trivial to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Mechanistic study reveals that the hypervalent iodine reagent might dimerize at solid state with the help of mechanical force. The active monomeric form of hypervalent iodine reagent might trigger the 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions in an intermolecular cascade manner.

         <title>Methyl Substitution Destabilizes Alkyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical stability decreases, and not increases, from methyl to primary to secondary to tertiary. This is not conflicting with the fact that the C&#8722;H bond becomes weaker along the corresponding series H3C&#8722;H, MeH2C&#8722;H, Me2HC&#8722;H, and Me3C&#8722;H. The resolution to this seeming contradiction is that the parent MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;H is destabilized even more upon methyl substitution than the radical MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901;.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically investigated how methyl substituents affect the stability of alkyl radicals MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901; and the corresponding MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;X bonds (X&#8201;=&#8201;H, CH3, OH; m&#8201;=&#8201;0&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;3) using density functional theory at M06&#8208;2X/TZ2P. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in physical organic chemistry is that alkyl radicals are stabilized upon an increase in their degree of substitution from methyl&lt;primary&lt;secondary&lt;tertiary, and that this is the underlying cause for the decrease in C&#8722;H bond strength along this series. Here, we provide evidence that falsifies this model and show that, on the contrary, the MemH3&#8722;mC&#8901; radical is destabilized with increasing substitution. The reason that the corresponding C&#8722;H bond nevertheless becomes weaker is that substitution destabilizes the sterically more congested MemH3&#8722;mC&#8722;H molecule even more.

&lt;p&gt;We have quantum chemically investigated how methyl substituents affect the stability of alkyl radicals Me&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;m&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8901; and the corresponding Me&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;m&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8722;X bonds (X&#8201;=&#8201;H, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, OH; m&#8201;=&#8201;0&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;3) using density functional theory at M06-2X/TZ2P. The state-of-the-art in physical organic chemistry is that alkyl radicals are stabilized upon an increase in their degree of substitution from methyl&amp;lt;primary&amp;lt;secondary&amp;lt;tertiary, and that this is the underlying cause for the decrease in C&#8722;H bond strength along this series. Here, we provide evidence that falsifies this model and show that, on the contrary, the Me&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;m&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8901; radical is &lt;i&gt;destabilized&lt;/i&gt; with increasing substitution. The reason that the corresponding C&#8722;H bond nevertheless becomes weaker is that substitution destabilizes the sterically more congested Me&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;m&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8722;H molecule even more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Highly Efficient High Salinity Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel as highly efficient solar evaporator is developed for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. The hydrogel evaporator could achieve a rapid solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with high energy efficiency (&#8776;94&#8201;%) in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine. This polyzwitterionic hydrogel offers insight to design next&#8208;generation solar evaporators for high&#8208;salinity brine.







Abstract
Interfacial solar vapor generation (SVG) is regarded as a promising and sustainable strategy for clean water production. While many materials have demonstrated excellent evaporation rates under one sun, it remains challenging to design solar evaporators without compromising SVG performance in high&#8208;salinity brines (&#8805;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Herein, polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) are proposed as a novel platform for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. Taking advantage of the unique anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, PZHs can trap salt ions from the brine water to form a more hydrated polymer network, leading to enhanced SVG performance. PZHs exhibit an exceptional solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine, which is &#8776;20&#8201;% higher than that in pure water. It is anticipated that salt&#8208;responsive PZHs may provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation solar desalination systems.

         <title>Work&#8208;function&#8208;induced Interfacial Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Os&#8208;OsSe2 Heterostructures for Active Acidic and Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional favorable charge balance is generated at Os&#8208;OsSe2 interfaces. The built&#8208;in electric field provides highly efficient HER active sites, accelerating the kinetics toward water electrolysis for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil that the formation of Os&#8208;OsSe2 heterostructures with neutralized work function (WF) perfectly balances the electronic state between strong (Os) and weak (OsSe2) adsorbents and bidirectionally optimizes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Os sites, significantly reducing thermodynamic energy barrier and accelerating kinetics process. Then, heterostructural Os&#8208;OsSe2 is constructed for the first time by a molten salt method and confirmed by in&#8208;depth structural characterization. Impressively, due to highly active sites endowed by the charge balance effect, Os&#8208;OsSe2 exhibits ultra&#8208;low overpotentials for HER in both acidic (26&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and alkaline (23&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) media, surpassing commercial Pt catalysts. Moreover, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen device assembled with Os&#8208;OsSe2 further highlights its potential application prospects. Profoundly, this special heterostructure provides a new model for rational selection of heterocomponents.

         <title>Au20(tBu3P)8: A Highly Symmetric Metalloid Gold Cluster in Oxidation State 0</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretically long&#8208;studied Au20 cluster was synthesized by a wet chemistry approach, solely stabilized by phosphine ligands. The presented superatom cluster possesses a high symmetrical structure and an oxidation state of the gold atoms of &#177;0.







Abstract
Metalloid gold clusters have unique properties with respect to size and structure and are key intermediates in studying transitions between molecular compounds and the bulk phase of the respective metal. In the following, the synthesis of the all&#8208;phosphine protected metalloid cluster Au20(tBu3P)8, solely built from gold atoms in the oxidation state of 0 is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a highly symmetric hollow cube&#8208;octahedral arrangement of the gold atoms, resembling gold bulk structure. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations illustrated the cluster can be described as a 20&#8208;electron superatom. Optical properties of the compound have shown molecular&#8208;like behavior.

         <title>(4+3) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Azadienes: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Azepanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 36, September 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azepanones are important and widespread seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, but their synthesis is challenging. A convergent method to access these scaffolds was developed relying on a (4+3) annulation reaction of azadienes and donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity were achieved using Yb(OTf)3 as the catalyst. Asymmetric induction was possible with Cu(OTf)2 in the presence of a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand.







Abstract
Azepanes are important seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, which are present in numerous natural and synthetic compounds. However, the development of convergent synthetic methods to access them remains challenging. Herein, we report the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulative addition of aryl and amino donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. Densely substituted azepane derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields and with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction occurred under mild conditions with ytterbium triflate as the catalyst. The use of copper triflate with a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand led to an enantioselective transformation. The obtained cycloadducts were convenient substrates for a series of further modifications, showing the synthetic utility of these compounds.

The key mechanism of additives in the formation of noncentrosymmetric solids has been clarified for the first time based on a new metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3, which exhibits excellent mid&#8208;IR NLO properties including the strongest SHG responses and the largest band gap for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, a sufficient birefringence, and a wide optical transparency window.







Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids have attracted interest for their potential in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical (NLO) devices, but their synthesis remains a major challenge. In this study, the additive Li2CO3 triggers formation of an NCS precursor at an early nucleation stage, and plays a crucial role in the successful polymorphism transformation. The resultant metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3 is a promising mid&#8208;infrared NLO crystal, with the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (2.2&#215;KTiOPO4 @ 2100&#8197;nm, 16&#215;KH2PO4 @ 1064&#8197;nm) and the largest optical band gap (4.52&#8197;eV) for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, as well as sufficient birefringence (&#916;n=0.219 @ 546&#8197;nm) for type I phase&#8208;matching, and wide optical transparency, which are induced by optimal alignment of the iodate anions. This study reveals the key role of additives in the growth of polar NCS solids, a discovery with implications for the strategic design of new NCS polymorphism materials with exceptional NLO properties.

         <title>An Organo&#8208;Palladium Host Built from a Dynamic Macrocyclic Ligand: Adaptive Self&#8208;Assembly, Induce&#8208;Fit Guest Binding, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial hosts with rich conformational dynamics are attractive to supramolecular chemists due to their adaptive guest binding properties and enzyme&#8208;like catalytic functions. We report here the adaptive self&#8208;assembly and host&#8208;guest catalysis of a new water&#8208;soluble organo&#8208;palladium host (Pd  2  L  2  ) built from a pyridinium&#8208;bonded macrocyclic ligand (L) and  cis  &#8208;blocked palladium corners (Pd). While direct self&#8208;assembly with L and Pd gives rise to a dynamic mixture of products, both neutral polyaromatic hydrocarbons and an anionic polyoxometalate cluster (W  10  O  32  4&#8208;  ) can template the sole formation of the Pd  2  L  2  host. Guest&#8208;adaptive conformational changes and induced&#8208;fit cavity deformation on the Pd  2  L  2  host have been clearly observed on the crystal structures. Moreover, the installation of the electron&#8208;rich W  10  O  32  4&#8208;  cluster within the cationic redox&#8208;active host (W  10  O  32  &#8834;Pd  2  L  2  ) facilitates efficient and selective C&#8208;H photooxidation of toluene derivatives to aldehyde products under mild conditions, representing an ideal platform for green supramolecular catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2||Graphite Batteries Operating at &#8208;60 &#730;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rechargeability of contemporary lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is challenging at low temperatures, mainly due to the hurdles faced by graphite anodes. Herein, by exploiting the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite, its low&#8208;temperature rechargeability is boosted. Experimental characterizations aided by theoretical calculations demonstrate that the co&#8208;intercalation process is featured by low interfacial resistance with a small charge transfer activation energy (0.23 eV atom&#8208;1  ) and an extremely low diffusion energy barrier (0.09 eV atom&#8208;1  ) which leads to nearly temperature&#8208;independent diffusion coefficients of the solvated Li&#8208;ion in graphite, enabling graphite to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8208;60 &#730;C with 73.7% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity. Consequently, the full&#8208;cell consisting of a LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2  cathode and a graphite anode shows impressive rechargeability under &#8208;60 &#730;C.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The rechargeability of contemporary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is challenging at low temperatures, mainly due to the hurdles faced by graphite anodes. Herein, by exploiting the Li-solvent co-intercalation into graphite, its low-temperature rechargeability is boosted. Experimental characterizations aided by theoretical calculations demonstrate that the co-intercalation process is featured by low interfacial resistance with a small charge transfer activation energy (0.23 eV atom-1  ) and an extremely low diffusion energy barrier (0.09 eV atom-1  ) which leads to nearly temperature-independent diffusion coefficients of the solvated Li-ion in graphite, enabling graphite to be stably charged-discharged at -60 &#730;C with 73.7% of its room-temperature capacity. Consequently, the full-cell consisting of a LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2  cathode and a graphite anode shows impressive rechargeability under -60 &#730;C. This work provides an alternative approach to develop low-temperature rechargeable LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hydrazides by One&#8208;Pot Sequential Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first catalytic enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was achieved using a sequential catalysis protocol. This strategy is based on a one&#8208;pot sequence of two organocatalytic cycles featuring the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by nitrogen alkylation under phase&#8208;transfer conditions. The resulting axially chiral hydrazides were obtained directly from commercially available reagents in high yields and with good stereocontrol. The permutation of organocatalysts allowed easy access to all stereoisomers, enabling a stereodivergent approach to enantioenriched atropisomeric hydrazides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetically versatile electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;electron systems are urgently needed for organic electronics, yet their design and synthesis are challenging due to the low reactivity from large electron affinities. In this work, we report a benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline diamide (BQQDA) &#960;&#8208;electron system. The electron&#8208;rich condensed amide as opposed to the generally&#8208;employed imide provides a suitable electronic feature for chemical versatility to tailor the BQQDA &#960;&#8208;electron system for various electronic applications. We demonstrate an effective synthetic method to furnish the target BQQDA parent structure, and highly selective functionalization can be performed on bay positions of the &#960;&#8208;skeleton. In addition, thionation of BQQDA can be achieved under mild conditions. Fine&#8208;tuning of fundamental properties and supramolecular packing motifs are achieved via chemical modifications, and the cyanated BQQDA organic semiconductor demonstrates a high air&#8208;stable electron&#8208;carrier mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Reforming of Polyol&#8208;based Biomass into CO and H2 over Nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO and H2  evolution from renewable and abundant biomass represent a sustainable way,  but is challenged to be produced under mild conditions. Herein, we propose to produce CO and H2  from biomass via a divided photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell at room temperature. Nitrogen doped tungsten trioxide (N&#8208;WO3  ) photoanode reforms biopolyols to CO and H+  , and platinum cathode reduces H+  to H2  , achieving CO evolution rate of 45 mmol m&#8722;2  h&#8722;1  (&gt;75 % gas selectivity) and H2  evolution rate of 237 mmol m&#8722;2  h&#8722;1  with purity &gt;99.99% from glycerol. The nitrogen doping induces structure polarity of WO3  photoanode, leading to the formation of an internal electric field which promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charges and improves PEC efficiency. A wide range of biopolyols, such as ethylene glycol, xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and inulin were effectively converted into CO and H2  . This work provides a promising method to produce highly pure H2  together with CO from biomass.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The quest of the active species in copper&#8208;mediated difluoromethylation of aryl halides led to the discovery of a powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph  4  P]  +  [Cu(CF  2  H)  2  ]  &#8211;  2  . Complex  2  was able to difluoromethylate a variety of electrophiles including electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides, heteroaryl iodides, activated heteroaryl bromides, chloride and aryl bromides with a directing group, as well as other electrophiles such as alkenyl iodide, benzyl bromides, allyl bromides, alkyl iodide, allyl carbonates and acid chloride. In addition, in the presence of an oxidant, complex  2  reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex  2  could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph  4  P]  +  [CuCl  2  ]  &#8211;  and [(DPPF)PdCl  2  ].</dc:description>

         <title>Static and Dynamic Gradient Based Directional Transportation of Neutral Molecules in Swollen Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated. Using an ~200 &#181;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60&#8208;fold within 4 hours. To accelerate transport kinetics, a dynamic gradient (a &#8216;travelling wave&#8217;) is utilized. Here, the non&#8208;polar dye pyrene was transported. The dynamic gradient is generated by an ion exchange process triggered by the localized introduction of an aqueous NaCl solution, which converts the gel from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front. The dynamic gradient provides about 10&#8208;fold faster transport kinetics than the static gradient.</dc:description>

Using an ~200 &#181;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60-fold within 4 hours. To accelerate transport kinetics, a dynamic gradient (a &#8216;travelling wave&#8217;) is utilized. Here, the non-polar dye pyrene was transported. The dynamic gradient is generated by an ion exchange process triggered by the localized introduction of an aqueous NaCl solution, which converts the gel from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front. The dynamic gradient provides about 10-fold faster transport kinetics than the static gradient.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. In this work, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing Trp side chain  via  manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerances, high site&#8208;selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production on a sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as attractive platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. In this study, we have implemented a gradient heating strategy to synthesize a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;JLU100, exhibiting high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and carrier mobility for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The Pt&#8208;doped COF&#8208;JLU100 demonstrated a high hydrogen evolution rate of over 100,000 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination (&#955; &gt; 420 nm). Experimental and theoretical studies corroborate that the cyano&#8208;vinylene segments in COF&#8208;JLU100 extend the &#960;&#8208;delocalization and enable fast charge transfer and separation rates as well as good dispersion in water. Moreover, COF&#8208;JLU100 can be prepared by low&#8208;cost and easily available monomers and has excellent stability, which is desirable for practical solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Be4B12+: A Covalently Bonded Archimedean Beryllo&#8208;Borospherene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene is reported herein theoretically. Boron motif undergoes drastic structural changes upon gradual beryllium doping in BenB12+ (n = 1&#8208;4) stoichiometries. The global minimum of the Be4B12+ cluster is a highly closed Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene in a 2A1 electronic ground state, composed of four B3 triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms. Beryllium can form strong bonding with boron clusters through strong electrostatic and covalent interaction. The bonding between a beryllium atom and Be3B12 unit is best described as a Be+ in a 2P excited state forming a strong and polarized electron&#8208;sharing bond with Be3B12 followed by several dative interactions by employing its vacant s, p, and very high&#8208;lying d orbitals. Counterintuitively, for an s&#8208;block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Ca2+:Cu2+ A&#8208;site Order in a Ferrimagnetic Double Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CaCuFeReO6 adopts the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. Ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins is observed at TC=567&#8197;K and the magnetoresistance displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases.







Abstract
Cation ordering in ABX3 perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we report discovery of CaCuFeReO6 with the tetragonal AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8242;=Mn compositions. CaCuFeReO6 occurs in the same phase field as CaCu3Fe2Re2O12 demonstrating that different A&#8208;cation ordered peroskites may be obtained in the same chemical system. CaCuFeReO6 has ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins below TC=567&#8197;K, in contrast to Mn analogues where the Mn spins order separately at much lower temperatures. The magnetoresistance of CaCuFeReO6 displays low&#8208;field &#8220;butterfly&#8221; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases. Many more AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites may be accessible for A&#8242;=Cu and other divalent transition metals at high pressure, so the presently known phases likely represent only the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; for this family.

         <dc:description>
From directing groups to borylation template reagents for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H borylation reactions: the use of a traceless directing group embedded into the borylation reagent opens attractive approaches for the regioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;containing heteroarenes without requiring prior installation of directing groups at the scaffold.







Abstract
The latest developments in the field of electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation reactions of arenes and heteroarenes without transition metals are briefly overviewed, with a particular emphasis on the latest advances enabling the highly regioselective C&#8722;H borylations of indoles and indolines using borylation template reagents.

         <title>Transmembrane Shuttling of Photosynthetically Produced Electrons to Propel Extracellular Biocatalytic Redox Reactions in a Modular Fashion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is utilized as benign electron&#8208;donor in photosynthesis, e.g. by cyanobacteria. Herein, a novel approach to shuttle them through the cyanobacterium's cell&#8208;membrane and to utilize them for extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions is presented. The concept was demonstrated for 19 different reductive and oxidative enzymes from 4 different classes.

Many biocatalytic redox reactions depend on the cofactor NAD(P)H, which may be provided by dedicated recycling systems. Exploiting light and water for NADPH&#8208;regeneration as it is performed, e.g. by cyanobacteria, is conceptually very appealing due to its high atom economy. However, the current use of cyanobacteria is limited, e.g. by challenging and time&#8208;consuming heterologous enzyme expression in cyanobacteria as well as limitations of substrate or product transport through the cell wall. Here we establish a transmembrane electron shuttling system propelled by the cyanobacterial photosynthesis to drive extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions. The modular photo&#8208;electron shuttling (MPS) overcomes the need for cloning and problems associated with enzyme&#8208; or substrate&#8208;toxicity and substrate uptake. The MPS was demonstrated on four classes of enzymes with 19 enzymes and various types of substrates, reaching conversions of up to 99&#8201;% and giving products with &gt;99&#8201;% optical purity.

&lt;p&gt;Water is utilized as benign electron-donor in photosynthesis, e.g. by cyanobacteria. Herein, a novel approach to shuttle them through the cyanobacterium's cell-membrane and to utilize them for extracellular NAD(P)H-dependent redox reactions is presented. The concept was demonstrated for 19 different reductive and oxidative enzymes from 4 different classes.

         <title>Cascades of Evolved Enzymes for the Synthesis of Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of enzymes in multistep reaction cascades offers new opportunities for drug synthesis and is often shorter than their chemical synthesis routes, thus supporting the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes. Recently, several cascades with evolved enzymes have been developed that have led to efficient synthetic pathways for highly complex molecules, thus pushing biocatalysis to a new level.







Abstract
Thanks to advances in enzyme discovery and protein engineering combined with the development of enzymatic multistep reaction cascades, new efficient routes for drug synthesis have been created that are superior to chemical syntheses. This supports the goal of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to move to more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes. Recently described outstanding examples include the biocatalytic cascade syntheses of the cyclic dinucleotide MK&#8208;1454, molnupiravir, and islatravir, as well as the efficient fixation of CO2 to make starch using an artificial enzyme cascade.

         <title>What Matters for a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article provides tips on how to increase the chances of securing a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant.







Abstract
European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grants are arguably the most competitive grants in Europe and their prestige is fully justified considering that they (i) allow focus on a high risk/high gain project through generous funding of 1.5&#8211;2&#8197;million Euros, (ii) they can enable the foundation of a new academic group and earn the submitting principle investigator a professorship, and (iii) they serve as a highly reputable award that can either facilitate tenure/promotion or assist in securing a subsequent academic position. However, the journey to getting one is far from easy. In this Viewpoint Article, I will discuss my first two unsuccessful attempts to secure an ERC Starting Grant and how the lessons learned during the process led me to ultimately secure a grant upon my third attempt.

         <title>A Hybrid Antiperovskite with Strong Linear and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiperovskites have been studied since the 1980s because of their rich physical and chemical properties, but their linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses remain largely unknown. Here we report a new polar crystal, Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) (I), which features a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional antiperovskite structure composed of ClCs6  polyhedra and A&#8208;site [HC3N3S3]2&#8208;  rings. To our best knowledge, this kind of antiperovskite structure is reported for the first time. Remarkably,  I  exhibits a very strong nonlinear optical response up to 11.4 times that of the benchmark KH2PO4  and an exceptionally large birefringence of 0.52. The first&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that [HC3N3S3]2&#8208;  is the &#8220;material gene&#8221; while the antiperovskite structural feature makes it in a favorable arrangement. This work provides a new structural platform for the rational design of integrated optoelectronic materials with linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X = Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds  via  single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereochemically defined organofluorine compounds are vital to drug discovery and many applicable catalytic strategies have been introduced for accessing these entities stereoselectively. One entails incorporation of a fluorine atom (C&#8211;F bond formation) or an organofluorine moiety (e.g., CF  3  or CF  2  H) , and another exploits commercially available compounds with one or more fluorine atoms. Here, our aim is to present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regarding the use of alkenyl and allylic fluorides in preparation of stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules. Allylic and alkenyl fluorides may be purchased or generated from a commercially available acid, carboxylate salt, ester, aldehyde hydrate, or ketone bearing several fluorine atoms next to a carbonyl group. We underscore the untapped potential of purchasable organofluorine compounds, many allylic and alkenyl fluorides, as launching points for development of stereoselective processes that are of value to therapeutic science.</dc:description>

         <title>Torsional Strain&#8208;Independent Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile bridged biaryls is emerging as a powerful strategy for atropisomer synthesis. However, the reported examples suffer from an inherent challenge as the reactivity is highly dependent on the torsional strain of the biaryl substrates, which significantly narrows down the scope and hampers the application.  Herein, we report our discovery and development of a torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides. By employing auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, a universal synthesis of both  tri  &#8208; and  tetra  &#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted thiazole&#8208;containing biaryls was realized in high yields with high enantioselectivities. In addition, these products could be facilely converted to a novel type of bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.</dc:description>

Mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the cause of this unusual torsional strain-independent reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Selenium and Tellurium Compounds using a Thermally Stable Phosphonium SF5&#8208; Salt Accessible from SF6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated group 16 moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but only few synthetic methods are available to prepare them. Herein, we report a new oxidative fluorination reagent capable of stabilizing reactive fluorinated anions. It consists of an SF  5  &#8722;  anion and a chemically inert phosphonium cation and is exceptionally thermally stable. Accordingly, it was used to generate the SeF  5  &#8722;  and TeF  5  &#8722;  anions from the elemental chalcogens and to prepare the unknown tetrafluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;  5  &#8208;selenates PhSeF  4  &#8722;  and &#8208;tellurates PhTeF  4  &#8722;  from the corresponding diphenyl dichalcogenides. In addition, we show that further derivatization of PhTeF  4  &#8722;  by oxidation to  trans  &#8208;PhTeF  4  O  &#8722;  and subsequent alkylation gives access to a new class of  trans  &#8208;(alkoxy)(phenyl)tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;  6  &#8208;tellanes (  trans  &#8208;PhTeF  4  OR), thus providing an approach to introduce the functional group into organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination of Electron&#8208;Rich Aryl Fluorides by an Anionic Rhodium&#8208;Gallium Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex catalyzed the hydrodefluorination of challenging C&#8722;F bonds in electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides and trifluoroarenes when irradiated with violet light in the presence of H  2  , a stoichiometric alkoxide base, and a crown&#8208;ether additive. Based on theoretical calculations, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is delocalized across both the Rh and Ga atoms, becomes singly occupied upon excitation, thereby poising the Rh&#8722;Ga complex for photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Stoichiometric and control reactions support that the C&#8722;F activation is mediated by the excited anionic Rh&#8208;Ga complex. After SET, the proposed neutral Rh(0) intermediate was detected by EPR spectroscopy, which matched the spectrum of an independently synthesized sample. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies corroborate the generation of aryl radicals during catalysis and their subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction from the THF solvent to generate the hydrodefluorinated arene products. Altogether, the combined experimental and theoretical data support an unconventional bimetallic excitation that achieves the activation of strong C&#8722;F bonds and uses H  2  and base as the terminal reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone  EtP4Q1  show negligible selectivity for C  5  hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto  EtP4Q1  NACs does not improve the selectivity, while  EtP4Q1  NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of  n  &#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8722;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry is of particular interest in drug delivery systems. However, high levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are hardly distinguished from GSH in normal cells, resulting in unmanageable cytotoxic drug release. This study investigates the spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled irreversible degradation of Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer (TIr3)&#8208;encapsulating nanogels (IrNG) through the hyperoxidation of resulting intracellular thiols using reactive oxygen species (ROS). A highly cytotoxic TIr3 was stably encapsulated within IrNG through hydrophobic interactions and reversible crosslinking between its disulfide bonds and thiols in the absence of light, resulting in high biocompatibility under normal cellular conditions. However, upon photoirradiation, TIr3 generated high levels of ROS, irreversibly oxidizing the thiols to induce electrostatic repulsion between the polymer molecules, resulting in the TIr3 release and induction of cancer cell apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>HXV2O5 Nanocatalysts Combined with Ultrasound for Triple Amplification of Oxidative Stress to Enhance Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium&#8208;based nanocatalysts (HVO) were constructed and employed as a novel biocatalyst for amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts combined with ultrasound could triply boost tumor oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS would cause mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death.







Abstract
Multiple amplification of tumor oxidative stress has been demonstrated as efficient strategy to enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. Herein, vanadium&#8208;based nanocatalysts, hydrogen vanadium bronzes (HXV2O5, for short HVO), were constructed and employed as novel biocatalysts for amplifying tumor oxidative stress and enhancing cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts harboring multivalent V element possessed multi&#8208;functional catalytic activity in decomposing H2O2 into &#8901;OH and depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) to dually amplify tumor oxidative stress. Meanwhile, HVO nanocatalysts could also be activated by ultrasound to further triply amplify oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS caused mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition. Collectively, HVO nanocatalysts highlight the remarkable value of ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapies.

&lt;p&gt;Multiple amplification of tumor oxidative stress has been demonstrated as efficient strategy to enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cancer therapy. Herein, vanadium-based nanocatalysts, hydrogen vanadium bronzes (H&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, for short HVO), were constructed and employed as novel biocatalysts for amplifying tumor oxidative stress and enhancing cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts harboring multivalent V element possessed multi-functional catalytic activity in decomposing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into &#8901;OH and depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) to dually amplify tumor oxidative stress. Meanwhile, HVO nanocatalysts could also be activated by ultrasound to further triply amplify oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS caused mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition. Collectively, HVO nanocatalysts highlight the remarkable value of ROS-mediated cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Initiative Collision at Microelectrodes with Vertically Mobile Micromotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic metal&#8211;organic framework micromotors with controllable vertical motion are applied to electrochemical impact measurements, which offer a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and the particles and shed light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.







Abstract
Impact experiments enable single particle analysis for many applications. However, the effect of the trajectory of a particle to an electrode on impact signals still requires further exploration. Here, we investigate the particle impact measurements versus motion using micromotors with controllable vertical motion. With biocatalytic cascade reactions, the micromotor system utilizes buoyancy as the driving force, thus enabling more regulated interactions with the electrode. With the aid of numerical simulations, the dynamic interactions between the electrode and micromotors are categorized into four representative patterns: approaching, departing, approaching&#8208;and&#8208;departing, and departing&#8208;and&#8208;reapproaching, which correspond well with the experimentally observed impact signals. This study offers a possibility of exploring the dynamic interactions between the electrode and particles, shedding light on the design of new electrochemical sensors.

         <title>Autonomous Chiral Microswimmers with Self&#8208;mixing Capabilities for Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;propelled microreactors producing chiral molecules with a high enantiomeric excess are proposed as a complementary approach with respect to classic stereoselective electroorganic synthesis. The straightforward concept is based on a spontaneous redox reaction occurring at the surface of zinc (micro)wires covered with chiral oligomers.







Abstract
The development of chiral catalysts plays a very important role in various areas of chemical science. Heterogeneous catalysts have the general advantage of allowing a more straightforward separation from the products. One specific case of heterogeneous catalysis is electrocatalysis, being potentially a green chemistry approach. However, a typical drawback is that the redox conversion of molecules occurs only at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and not in the bulk of the electrolyte. The second limitation is that the electrodes have to be physically connected to a power supply to induce the desired reactions. To circumvent these problems, we propose here a complementary approach by replacing macroscopic electrodes with an ensemble of self&#8208;propelled redox active microswimmers. They move autonomously in solution while transforming simultaneously a prochiral starting compound into a specific enantiomer with a very high enantiomeric excess, accompanied by a significantly increased production rate of the favorite enantiomer.

         <title>The Origin of High&#8208;Voltage Stability in Single&#8208;Crystal Layered Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The drastic H2/H3 phase transition and destructive H3b phase formation presented in PC electrode are effectively suppressed in SC cathodes when cycling at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, in which the origin of excellent high&#8208;voltage stability in single&#8208;crystal was clearly clarified.







Abstract
Compared with the polycrystal (PC) Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials, the single&#8208;crystal (SC) counterpart displayed excellent structural stability, high reversible capacity and limited voltage decay during cycling, which received great attention from academics and industry. However, the origin of fascinating high&#8208;voltage stability within SC is poorly understood yet. Herein, we tracked the evolution of phase transitions, in which the destructive volume change and H3 phase formation presented in PC, are effectively suppressed in SC when cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, further clarifying the origin of high&#8208;voltage stability in SC cathode. Moreover, SC electrode displayed crack&#8208;free morphology, and excellent electrochemical stability during long&#8208;term cycling, whereas PC suffered severe capacity and voltage fade because of the spinel&#8208;like phase, decoding the failure mechanisms of PC and SC during cycling at high cut&#8208;off voltages. This finding provides universal insights into high&#8208;voltage stability and failure mechanisms of layered Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Molecular Electrochemical Reductive Splitting of Dinitrogen with a Molybdenum Complex
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N2 splitting is achieved with a simple Mo complex at a carbon electrode. Controlled reduction (a 3 electron transfer process) at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (vs. SCE) and ambient conditions (room T and atmospheric P) afforded a Mo nitride complex in 30&#8201;% yield. DFT studies support the transient formation of a MoI&#8722;N2&#8208;MoI bridging dimer.







Abstract
Nitrogen reduction under mild conditions (room T and atmospheric P), using a non&#8208;fossil source of hydrogen remains a challenge. Molecular metal complexes, notably Mo based, have recently been shown to be active for such nitrogen fixation. We report electrochemical N2 splitting with a MoIII triphosphino complex [(PPP)MoI3], at room temperature and a moderately negative potential. A MoIV nitride species was generated, which is confirmed by electrochemistry and NMR studies. The reaction goes through two successive one electron reductions of the starting Mo species, coordination of a N2 molecule, and further splitting to a MoIV nitride complex. Preliminary DFT studies support the formation of a bridging MoIN2MoI dinitrogen dimer evolving to the Mo nitride via a low energy transition state. This example joins a short list of molecular complexes for N2 electrochemical reductive cleavage. It opens a door to electrochemical proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) conversion studies of N2 to NH3.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Glutathione Peroxidase Degrader Induces Ferroptosis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule protein degrader based on the strategy of proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) was designed to deplete glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and regulate cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4 shows a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition. Moreover, the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using a novel type of biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces ferroptosis in vivo to effectively suppress tumor growth without appreciable side effects.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent phospholipid peroxidation. Its therapeutic potential is however, greatly limited by the low efficiency of regulating cell ferroptosis in vivo. Herein, we report a PROTAC&#8208;based protein degrader that depletes endogenous glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and induces cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4, can deplete tumor cell GPX4 via proteasomal protein degradation, showing a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition using ML162. Moreover, we show that the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces cell&#8208;selective ferroptosis by targeting cancer cell microenvironment. The in vivo administration of dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12 effectively suppresses tumor growth without appreciable side effects. We anticipate the protein degradation strategy described herein could be easily expanded to other essential regulatory proteins of ferroptosis for developing targeted cancer therapeutics.

Herein, we report a PROTAC-based protein degrader that depletes endogenous glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and induces cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4, can deplete tumor cell GPX4 via proteasomal protein degradation, showing a five-fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition using ML162. Moreover, we show that the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401-TK-12) induces cell-selective ferroptosis by targeting cancer cell microenvironment. The in vivo administration of dGPX4@401-TK-12 effectively suppresses tumor growth without appreciable side effects. We anticipate the protein degradation strategy described herein could be easily expanded to other essential regulatory proteins of ferroptosis for developing targeted cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unblocking Ion&#8208;occluded Pore Channels in Poly(triazine imide) Framework for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride with nanoporous framework. However, pores in PTI are blocked by Li+ and halide ions, and a complete removal of ions leads to an impermeable AB stacking. We report an ion&#8208;exchange route which tunably opens pore channels while maintaining the AA&#8242; configuration leading to an improved proton conductivity.







Abstract
Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride hosting &#197;&#8208;scale pores attractive for selective molecular transport. AA&#8217;&#8208;stacked PTI layers are synthesized by ionothermal route during which ions occupy the framework and occlude the pores. Synthesis of ion&#8208;free PTI hosting AB&#8208;stacked layers has been reported, however, pores in this configuration are blocked by the neighboring layer. The unavailability of open pore limits application of PTI in molecular transport. Herein, we demonstrate acid treatment for ion depletion which maintains AA&#8217; stacking and results in open pore structure. We provide first direct evidence of ion&#8208;depleted open pores by imaging with the atomic resolution using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the extent of ion&#8208;exchange, AA&#8217; stacking with open channels and AB stacking with closed channels are obtained and imaged for the first time. The accessibility of open channels is demonstrated by enhanced proton transport through ion depleted PTI.

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Theranostic Prodrug with Self&#8208;Sustainable Magnification Effect of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a theranostic prodrug that could self&#8208;report the drug release, immunogenic cell death (ICD) progression, and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation with activated near&#8208;infrared afterglow chemiluminescence. Such an intelligent prodrug also shows a unique self&#8208; sustainable ICD magnification effect, completely eradicating the existing tumor and preventing further tumor recurrence through enhanced antitumor immune response.







Abstract
Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow theranostic prodrug that circumvents high background noise interference caused by external light excitation. The prodrug can release hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) in response to the high intratumoral peroxynitrite level associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD), and synchronously activate afterglow signal to monitor the drug release process and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation. The prodrug itself is an ICD inducer achieved by photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT initiates ICD and recruits first&#8208;arrived neutrophils to secrete peroxynitrite to trigger HCPT release. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that HCPT can significantly amplify PDT&#8208;mediated ICD process. The prodrug thus shows a self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect by establishing an &#8220;ICD&#8208;HCPT release&#8208;amplified ICD&#8221; cycling loop. In vivo studies demonstrate that the prodrug can eradicate existing tumors and prevent further tumor recurrence through antitumor immune response.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence of Perovskites with Reduced Dimensionality Achieved by Manipulating Adsorption&#8208;Energy Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have exemplified the critical role of adsorption&#8208;energy differences in the structural regulation of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites by complementing theoretical calculations and experiments. As a result, we achieved deep&#8208;blue PeLED peaking at 457&#8197;nm with a record EQE of 4.62&#8201;% accompanied by stablly electroluminescent spectra. Our findings provide a way for PeLEDs to develop their full technological potential.







Abstract
The lagging development of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) heavily impedes their practical applications in full&#8208;color display due to the absence of spectrally stable emitters and the mismatch of carrier injection capacity. Herein, we report highly efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs through a new chemical strategy that addresses the dilemma for simultaneously constant electroluminescence (EL) spectra and high&#8208;purify phase in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites. The success lies in the control of adsorption&#8208;energy differences between phenylbutylamine (PBA) and ethylamine (EA) interacting with perovskites, which facilitates narrow n&#8208;value distribution. This approach leads to an increased exciton binding energy and enhanced surface potential, hence improving radiative recombination. As a result, an external quantum efficiency of 4.62&#8201;% is achieved in PeLEDs with a stable EL peak at 457&#8197;nm, demonstrating the best reported result for deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs so far.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Indium&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed In&#8722;Cu metal pairs anchored on polymeric carbon nitride catalysts (InCu/PCN) were designed and produced by a facile thermal polymerization approach to support photocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol. The metal pairs exert synergistic interactions that enhance the activity and adsorption of metal sites to promote C&#8722;C coupling and subsequent formation of ethanol.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 to C2+ solar fuel is a promising carbon&#8208;neutral technology for renewable energy. This strategy is challenged by its low productivity due to low efficiency in multielectron utilization and slow C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. This work reports a dual&#8208;metal photocatalyst consisting of atomically dispersed indium and copper anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (InCu/PCN), on which the photoreduction of CO2 delivered an excellent ethanol production rate of 28.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 92&#8201;%. Coupled experimental investigation and DFT calculations reveal the following mechanisms underpinning the high performance of this catalyst. Essentially, the In&#8722;Cu interaction enhances the charge separation by accelerating charge transfer from PCN to the metal sites. Indium also transfers electrons to neighboring copper via Cu&#8722;N&#8722;In bridges, increasing the electron density of copper active sites. Furthermore, In&#8722;Cu dual&#8208;metal sites promote the adsorption of *CO intermediates and lower the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Successive Redox&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Triggered Interface Radical Polymerization for Growing Hydrogel Coatings on Diverse Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface modification method without UV assistance is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto diverse substrates regardless of material size, geometry, and transparency. This strategy takes advantage of the synergy among the catechol adhesion mechanism, coordination to metal ions and its unique redox reactivity for interface polymerization, providing a simple and universal route for surface modification.







Abstract
Growing lubricating hydrogel coatings in controllable manners on diverse material surfaces demonstrates promising applications. Here, a surface modification method is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto surfaces of diverse substrates in the absence of UV assistance. It is performed by decorating substrates with a universal mussel&#8208;inspired synthetic adhesive with catechol groups. Upon being immersed in reaction solution, these groups can assist substrate bonding and in situ capture and reduce Fe3+ into Fe2+ for decomposing S2O82&#8722; into SO4&#8722;. catalytically at the interface to initiate interface polymerization of monomers. As a result, hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness could be grown on surfaces of arbitrary substrates to change their surface characteristics regardless of materials size, category, geometry and transparency, implying considerable potential in surface engineering.

     alt="Successive Redox-Reaction-Triggered Interface Radical Polymerization for Growing Hydrogel Coatings on Diverse Substrates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surface modification method without UV assistance is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto diverse substrates regardless of material size, geometry, and transparency. This strategy takes advantage of the synergy among the catechol adhesion mechanism, coordination to metal ions and its unique redox reactivity for interface polymerization, providing a simple and universal route for surface modification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing lubricating hydrogel coatings in controllable manners on diverse material surfaces demonstrates promising applications. Here, a surface modification method is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto surfaces of diverse substrates in the absence of UV assistance. It is performed by decorating substrates with a universal mussel-inspired synthetic adhesive with catechol groups. Upon being immersed in reaction solution, these groups can assist substrate bonding and in situ capture and reduce Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; into Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for decomposing S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;.&lt;/sup&gt; catalytically at the interface to initiate interface polymerization of monomers. As a result, hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness could be grown on surfaces of arbitrary substrates to change their surface characteristics regardless of materials size, category, geometry and transparency, implying considerable potential in surface engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directly Imaging Dynamic Electronic Coupling during Electrochemical Oxidation of Single Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During electrochemical oxidation processes, a dip behavior for single Ag nanoparticles on Au electrodes is directly visualized using a monochromatic bright field imaging technique. This observation can be attributed to interfacial Au&#8722;Ag electronic coupling interactions, which are manifested as the heterogeneity of electrochemical activity of individual Ag nanoparticles.







Abstract
The electronic coupling between a metal electrode and single nano&#8208;entities is of unfading significance which impacts the heterogeneous electron transfer. Herein, we demonstrated a simple optical technique for directly imaging the transient interfacial electronic coupling events during electrochemical oxidation of single Ag nanoparticles on Au electrode. The electronic coupling brings out a dramatic dip behavior of bright field imaging traces, and is conductive to cross the energy barrier of oxidation for single silver nanoparticles. This dip behavior is further verified by in situ vis&#8208;transmission spectroscopy, and the heterogeneity of the Au&#8722;Ag electronic coupling down to single&#8208;nanoparticle level is uncovered by unifying the morphology and size of individual silver nanoparticles. These results suggest the interfacial electronic coupling facilitates electron transfer of single nanoparticles, and provide important insight into understanding detailed mechanism of nanoelectrochemistry.

         <title>A Rebuilding&#8208;Free Nucleic Acid Detection Strategy Enables Ultrasensitive Genotyping, N&#8208;in&#8208;1 Logic Screening and Accurate Multiplex Assay of Dangerous Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Sensitive, rapid and low&#8208;cost nucleic acid detection is critical for controlling infectious pathogens. Here, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use and multimodal detection based on a rebuilding&#8208;free, ultrasensitive and selective strategy named dual hairpin ligation&#8208;induced isothermal amplification pro (DHLApro). Taking influenza A, influenza B, MERS&#8208;CoV, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as model targets, we demonstrate DHLApro provides &#8776;zM level ultra&#8208;sensitivity, being equaling to 0.45&#8197;copy/&#956;L in original sample. By simply changing the recognition module, a set of DHLApro components can be applied to a new target without performance loss. Moreover, DHLApro innovatively allows flexible logic/multiplex assay using one set of primer, for example, the &#8220;N pathogens&#8208;in&#8208;1&#8221; OR gate screening and accurate multi&#8208;channel multiplex assay. Compared with traditional methods, the cost of this logic/multiplex assay has been largely reduced and the cross&#8208;interference between the multiple primer sets is also avoided.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stibenium: Lewis Superacidity by Antimony(III)&#8208;Antimony(V) Electromerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the calix[4]pyrrolato stibenium cation is treated with pyridine, a Lewis&#8208;base coordination&#8208;induced electromerism transforms the low&#8208;affinity stibenium to a high&#8208;affinity stibonium state. The generated transient stibonium ion readily reacts with SbF6&#8722; and illustrates a Lewis superacid that can be triggered by electromerism.







Abstract
Lewis superacids enable the activation of highly inert substrates. However, the permanent presence of a Lewis superacidic center comes along with a constantly increased intolerance toward functional groups or ambient conditions. Herein, we describe a strategy to unleash Lewis superacidity by electromerism. Experimental and computational results indicate that coordinating a Lewis base to &#916;&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato&#8208;antimony(III) triggers a ligand redox&#8208;noninnocent coupled transfer into antimony(V)&#8208;state that exhibits Lewis superacidic features. Lewis acidity by electromerism establishes a concept of potential generality for powerful yet robust reagents and on&#8208;site substrate activation approaches.

         <dc:description>
We present an activatable virus&#8208;mimicking NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe based on PbS quantum dots (QDs) encapsulated in a Fe2+&#8208;coordinating viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection, providing a favorable approach for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis.







Abstract
Viral encephalitis is an inflammatory disease of the brain parenchyma and caused by various viral infections. In vivo monitoring of the progression of viral infections can aid accurate diagnosis of viral encephalitis and effective intervention. We developed an activatable and reversible virus&#8208;mimicking near&#8208;infrared II nanoprobe consisting of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated, viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle encapsulating PbS quantum dots with a 1300&#8197;nm fluorescence emission. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection by tuning the quenching level of quantum dots and regulating the fusion&#8211;fission behavior of vesicles via changes in Fe oxidation state. This switching strategy reduces background noise and improves detection sensitivity, making this nanoprobe a promising imaging agent for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis and future clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Humidity Shaker Aging to Access Chitin and Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8217;s potential in affording functional biomaterials is often hindered by extraction conditions. To isolate nanocrystalline domains in polysaccharides high solvent usage is warranted while low reactivity and yields are also limiting factors. In this report, the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance is described, relying on a new method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA). The method involves a brief and mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate. Insights into the mechanism were uncovered, which highlighted the unique role of high humidity to afford a gradual uptake of water by the material up to deliquescence when the reaction is complete. This process was then validated for direct synthesis of nanocrystals from biomass sources including crab and soft wood pulp.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermediate oxidation state of sulfoxides is central to the plethora of their applications in chemistry and medicine, yet it presents challenges for an efficient synthetic access, limiting the structural diversity of currently available sulfoxides. Here, we report a data&#8208;guided development of direct decarboxylative sulfinylation that enables the previously inaccessible functional group interconversion of carboxylic acids to sulfoxides in a reaction with sulfinates. Given the broad availability of carboxylic acids and the growing synthetic potential of sulfinates, the direct decarboxylative sulfinylation is poised to improve the structural diversity of synthetically accessible sulfoxides. The reaction is facilitated by a kinetically favored sulfoxide formation from the intermediate sulfinyl sulfones, despite the strong thermodynamic preference for the sulfone formation, unveiling the previously unknown and chemoselective radicalophilic sulfinyl sulfone reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for&#160;Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of high&#8208;entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery materials.  Herein,  we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high&#8208;entropy by a facile coprecipitation method.  The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate  that high&#8208;entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance.  Additionally, a variety of  nano  cubic  metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our  coprecipitation  and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Imaging of Ion Motion in a Single Nanoparticle: Structural Transformations in Selenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intraparticle ion motions are critical to the structure and properties of nanomaterials, but rarely disclosed. Herein, in&#8208;situ visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle is presented by dark&#8208;field microscopy imaging, which shows HgCl2&#8208;induced structural transformation of amorphous selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with the main composition of Se8. Owing to the high binding affinity with selenium and coulomb interactions, Hg2+ ions can permeate into the interior of SeNPs, making the amorphous Se8 turn to polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2. As a proof of concept, SeNPs then serve as a highly effective scavenger for selective removal of Hg2+ ions from solution. This new finding offers visual proof for the photophysical process involving intraparticle ion motion, demonstrating that tracking the ion motions is a novel strategy to comprehend the formation mechanism with the purpose of developing new nanostructures like nanoalloys and nano metal compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobicity directed chiral self&#8208;assembly and aggregation induced emission: Diacetylene&#8208;cored pseudopeptide chiral dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we delineate simple and tunable hydrophobically driven chiral functional assemblies of diacetylene cored pseudopeptides. These amino acid appended, rigid core dialkynes constitute promising chiral supramolecular building blocks for materials properties engineering. The chiral appended amino acid elements allow for simple tuning of solubility and interaction properties as well as governing chirality, while the central dialkyne core can impart hydrophobically driven assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The self&#8208;assembly of these rod&#8208;like dialkynes can be regulated by tuning the solvent environment, with for example self&#8208;assembly into vesicles in acetonitrile and into helical organization with AIE in a H  2  O/DMSO mixture. Of additional high interest, these supramolecular materials, themselves devoid of liquid crystal (LC) properties, can induce chirality into non&#8208;chiral LC matrices with high helical twisting power.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;doping effect on two&#8208;photon absorption and luminescence of atomically precise silver ligated nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble metal nanoclusters allow for the atomically&#8208;precise control of their composition. However, to create nanoclusters with pre&#8208;defined optical properties, comprehensive description of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the gold atom doping impact on one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) and luminescence properties of ligated silver nanoclusters via combined experimental studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations (TD&#8208;DFT). We synthesized a series of Ag25&#8208;xAux(DMBT)18 nanoclusters where x=0, 1 and 5&#8208;10. For Ag24Au1(DMBT)18 we demonstrate that the presence of the central Au dopant strongly influences linear and non&#8208;linear optical properties, increasing photoluminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness, with respect to undoped silver nanoclusters. With improved TPA and luminescence, atomically&#8208;precise AuAg alloys presented in our work can serve as robust luminescent probes e.g. for bioimaging in the second biological window.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxy&#8208;Borylenes as Photoreductants: Synthesis and Application in Dehalogenation and Detosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract  : While the range of accessible borylenes has significantly broadened over the last decade, applications remain limited. Herein, we present tricoordinate oxy&#8208;borylenes as potent photoreductants that can be readily activated by visible light. Facile oxidation of CAAC stabilized oxy&#8208;borylenes (CAAC)(IPr  2  Me  2  )BOR (R = TMS, CH  2  CH  2  C  6  H  5  , CH  2  CH  2  (4&#8208;F)C  6  H  4  ) to their corresponding radical cations is achieved with mildly oxidizing ferrocenium ion. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8211;1.90 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  for such oxy&#8208;borylenes placing them among the strongest organic super electron donors. Their ability as photoreductants is further supported by theoretical studies and showcased by the application as stoichiometric reagents for the photochemical hydrodehalogenation of aryl chlorides, aryl bromides and unactivated alkyl bromides as well as the detosylation of anilines.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8211;Uptake Relationship Study of DABCYL Derivatives Linked to Cyclic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Live&#8208;Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating deca&#8208;arginine (cR10) peptides with 4&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) improves the uptake efficiency of synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) cargoes into living cells. In order to probe the role of the DABCYL moiety, we performed time&#8208;lapse microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of fluorescent DABCYL&#8208;R10 to evaluate the impact on cell entry by the formation of nucleation zones. Furthermore, we performed a structure&#8208;uptake relationship study with thirteen DABCYL derivatives coupled to CPP to examine their effect on the cell&#8208;uptake efficiency when conjugated to mono&#8208;Ub via disulfide linkages. Our results show that through structure variations of the DABCYL alone we could reach, at nanomolar concentration, an additional threefold increase in the cytosolic delivery of Ub, which will enable studies on various intracellular processes related to Ub signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Adsorption and Desorption at the CaF2&#8208;Water Interface Probed by Flow Experiments and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dissolution of minerals in contact with water plays a crucial role in geochemistry. However, obtaining molecular insight into interfacial chemistry is challenging. Dissolution typically involves the release of ions from the surface, giving rise to a charged mineral surface. This charge affects the interfacial water arrangement, which can be investigated by surface&#8208;specific vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (v&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy. For the fluorite&#8208;water interface, recent spectroscopic studies concluded that fluoride adsorption/desorption determines the surface charge, which contrasts zeta potential measurements assigning this role to the calcium ion. By combining v&#8209;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments with systematically suppressed dissolution, we uncover the interplay of dominant fluoride and weak calcium adsorption/desorption, resolving the controversy in the literature. We infer the calcium contribution to be orders of magnitude smaller, emphasizing the sensitivity of our approach.</dc:description>

         <title>An Anticancer Rhenium Tricarbonyl Targets Fe&#8208;S Cluster Biogenesis in Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Target identification remains a critical challenge in inorganic drug discovery to deconvolute potential polypharmacology. Here, we describe an improved approach to prioritize candidate protein targets based on a combination of dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomics and treatment effects in living cancer cells for the rhenium tricarbonyl compound TRIP. Chemoproteomics revealed 89 distinct dose&#8208;dependent targets with concentrations of competitive saturation between 0.1&#8211;32&#160;&#181;M despite the broad proteotoxic effects of TRIP. Target response networks revealed two highly probable targets of which the Fe&#8208;S cluster biogenesis factor NUBP2 was competitively saturated by free TRIP at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, TRIP treatment led to a down&#8208;regulation of Fe&#8208;S cluster&#8208;containing proteins and upregulated ferritin. Fe&#8208;S cluster depletion was further verified by assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Consequently, TRIP emerges as a first&#8208;in&#8208;class modulator of the scaffold protein NUBP2, which disturbs Fe&#8208;S cluster biogenesis at sub&#8208;cytotoxic concentrations in ovarian cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetra&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted, heteroaryl and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as three key strategies on morphology design of photoswitch to diversify controllability. Cyclic azobenzene is of particular utilization in photo&#8208;energy conversion due to rigid and ring&#8208;strain structure. Despite the well&#8208;recognized diazocine, the photo&#8208;switching properties of seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes (diazepines) have yet been exploited. Herein, we report a family of dibenzo[  b,f  ][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepines (DBChDs) and their T&#8208;type photo&#8208;switching nature with tunable relaxation rate. Based on experiments together with DFT calculations, we found that an unsymmetric 2&#8208;bithiophenyl&#8208;dibenzo[  b,f  ][1,4,5]thiadiazepine exhibited an efficient response to 445 nm laser stimulation (quantum efficiency, &#934;  Z  &#8594;E  = 0.71) with millisecond relaxation half&#8208;life (  t  1/2  = 40 ms). Photo&#8208;energy transduction efficiency was also exceptionally high with 29.1% converted into ring&#8208;strain energy mainly loaded on azo &#960;&#8208;bond.</dc:description>
