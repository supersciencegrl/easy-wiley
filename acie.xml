         <title>A family of heterobimetallic cubes shows spin&#8208;crossover behaviour near room temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using 4&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)aniline as a simple organic building block in combination with three different aldehyde components together with metal(II) salts gave three different Fe  8  Pt  6  &#8208;cubes and their corresponding Zn  8  Pt  6  analogues by employing the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly approach. Whereas the use of zinc(II) salts gave rise to diamagnetic cages, iron(II) salts yielded metallosupramolecular cages that show spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The spin&#8208;transition temperature T  1/2  depends on the incorporated aldehyde component, giving a construction kit for the deliberate synthesis of spin&#8208;crossover compounds with tailored transition properties. Incorporation of 4&#8208;thiazolecarbaldehyde or  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazole&#8208;carbaldehyde yielded cages that undergo spin&#8208;crossover around room temperature whereas the cage obtained using 1  H  &#8208;4&#8208;imidazolecarbaldehyde shows a spin&#8208;transition at low temperatures. Three new structures were characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and all structures were characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing A New Class of Sulfonyl Fluoride Hubs via Radical Chloro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro&#8208;fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as  cis  alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>The First High&#8208;Pressure Chromium Oxonitridoborate CrB4O6N &#8208; an Unexpected Link to Nitridosilicate&#8208;Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CrB4O6N crystallizes in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (no. 186) with the lattice parameters a = 5.1036(1), c = 8.3519(3) &#197;, and a volume of 188.40(1) &#197;3. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature experiment at 7 GPa and 1673 K and represents the first high&#8208;pressure oxonitridoborate. It is built up of star&#8208;like shaped entities of four BO3N tetrahedra, connected via one common nitrogen atom that resembles the fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen atoms in the homeotypic nitridosilicates MYbSi4N7 (M = Ba, Sr). Building up a network with channels that contain the Cr3+ ions, CrB4O6N contains for the first time a tetrahedral building unit in contrast to trigonal planar B(O/N)3 entities in all other known oxonitridoborates. The structural relations as well as the results of spectroscopic measurements and calculations on the chromium&#8208;oxonitridoborate are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Pd3Bi Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying is a general strategy for modulating the electronic structures of catalyst materials. Compared to more common solid&#8208;solution alloys, intermetallic alloys feature well&#8208;defined atomic arrangements and provide the unique platform for studying the structure&#8208;performance correlations. It is, unfortunately, synthetically challenging to prepare the nanostructures of intermetallic alloys for catalysis research. In this contribution, we prepare intermetallic Pd  3  Bi nanocrystals of a uniform size via a facile solvothermal method. These nanocrystals can phase&#8208;transform into solid solution alloy via thermal annealing while retaining a similar composition and size. In 0.1 M KHCO  3  aqueous solution, the intermetallic Pd  3  Bi can selectively reduce CO  2  to formate with high selectivity (~100%) and stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.35 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, whereas the solid solution alloy has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60%. Such unique phase&#8208;dependence is understood via theoretical simulations showing that the crystallographic ordering of Pd and Bi atoms within intermetallic alloys can suppress CO poisoning and enhance the *OCHO adsorption during electrochemical CO  2  reduction to formate.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Integrated Cu&#8208;Based Nanoparticles/Amorphous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Facile Spray&#8208;Drying Method: Highly Enhanced CO2 Hydrogenation Activity for Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We first report on  Cu/  am  UiO&#8208;66  , a composite made of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and amorphous [Zr  6  O  4  (OH)  4  (BDC)  6  ] (  am  UiO&#8208;66, BDC = 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), and  Cu&#8211;ZnO/  am  UiO&#8208;66  made of Cu&#8211;ZnO nanocomposites and  am  UiO&#8208;66  . Both structures were obtained via a spray&#8208;drying method and characterized using high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectra, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The catalytic activity of  Cu/  am  UiO&#8208;66  for CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol was 3&#8208;fold that of Cu/crystalline UiO&#8208;66. Moreover,  Cu&#8211;ZnO/  am  UiO&#8208;66  enhanced the methanol production rate by 1.5&#8208;fold compared with  Cu/  am  UiO&#8208;66  and 2.5&#8208;fold compared with &#947;&#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;supported Cu&#8211;ZnO nanocomposites (  Cu&#8211;ZnO/&#947;&#8208;Al  2  O  3  ) as the representative hydrogenation catalyst. The high catalytic performance was investigated using in situ Fourier transform IR spectra.

         <title>Ball&#8208;milling induced debonding of surface atoms from metal bulk for construing high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site single&#8208;atom catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insert abstract text here. One of the most pressing challenges in single&#8208;atom catalysis is the manipulation of the coordination environment of the central metals to maximize catalyst performance. Herein, we fabricated a high&#8208;performance catalyst (Co&#8208;SNC) by introducing S into the neighboring position of the Co&#8211;N4 coordination. The developed ball&#8208;milling method enabled large&#8208;scale synthesis, and over 4.7 g of Co&#8208;SNC could be produced in one pot. In the benzylamine coupling reaction, Co&#8208;SNC exhibited the highest conversion of 97.5% with 99% selectivity toward N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine in 10 h among various Co catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed the crucial role of S atoms, which serve as the active sites for O2 activation, leaving the Co atoms free to adsorb benzylamine. Consequently, the adsorption energies of O2 and benzylamine were significantly increased. Our strategy suggests a feasible approach to enhance catalytic performance by delicately integrating dual active sites into a single catalyst unit.</dc:description>

In the benzylamine coupling reaction, Co-SNC exhibited the highest conversion of 97.5% with 99% selectivity toward N-benzylidenebenzylamine in 10 h among various Co catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed the crucial role of S atoms, which serve as the active sites for O2 activation, leaving the Co atoms free to adsorb benzylamine. Consequently, the adsorption energies of O2 and benzylamine were significantly increased. Our strategy suggests a feasible approach to enhance catalytic performance by delicately integrating dual active sites into a single catalyst unit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free Zn2+ solvation structure for robust Zn metal anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries are potential for large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage due to their low cost and high security. However, Zn metal anode suffers from the dendritic growth and interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in the deterioration of electrode/battery performance. Here we propose that both dendrites and HER are related to the water participated Zn  2+  solvation structure&#8722;Zn(H  2  O)  6  2+  and thus can be resolved by transforming Zn(H  2  O)  6  2+  to an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free solvation structure&#8722;ZnCl  4  2&#8722;  , which is achieved in traditional ZnSO  4  aqueous electrolyte after adding chloride salt with bulky cation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). The elimination of cation&#8208;water interaction suppresses HER, while the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and the anion solvation structure inhibits dendrite formation. As a result, the electrolyte shows uniform Zn deposition with an average Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of ~99.9%, enabling a capacity retention of 78.8% after 300 cycles in anode&#8208;free Zn batteries with pre&#8208;zincificated polyaniline as the cathode. This work provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to prevent HER and realize long&#8208;lifespan metal anode.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lamellar MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/PSS Composite Membrane for Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of Li+/Mg2+  has always been a pendent problem in lithium extraction due to their similar chemical properties and structures. Here, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) laminar membrane with Li  +  selective transport channels is obtained by stacking MXene nanosheets with the introduction of poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrene sulfonate) (PSS) with active sulfonate sites, which exhibits excellent Li+  selectivity from ionic mixture solutions of Na+, K+, and Mg2+  . The Li+  permeation rate through the MXene@PSS composite membrane is as high as 0.08 mol m&#8208;2  h&#8208;1  , while the Li+/Mg2+  , Li+  /Na+  , and Li+/K+  selectivities are 28, 15.5, and 12.7, respectively. Combining the simulation and experimental results, we further confirm that the highly selective rapid transport of partially dehydrated Li+  within subnanochannels can be attributed to the precisely controlled interlayer spacing and the relatively weaker ion&#8208;terminal (&#8208;SO3&#8208;  ) interaction. This study deepens the understanding of ions selective permeation in confined channels and provides a general membrane design concept with specific recognition that could be applied in sensors, biomembrane modules, nanofluidic devices, etc.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Topochemical reactions, high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state reactions arising from the proximal alignment of reacting partners in the crystal lattice, do not require solvents, catalysts, and additives are of high demand in the context of green processes and environmental safety.

We present the topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) reaction, wherein alkene and azide groups undergo lattice&#8208;controlled cycloaddition reaction giving triazoline in crystals. A designed monomer that arranges in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner in its crystals pre&#8208;organizing the reacting groups of adjacent molecules in proximity undergoes spontaneous cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, yielding the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. A unique advantage of this reaction is that the triazoline can be converted to aziridine by simple heating, which we exploited for the otherwise challenging post&#8208;synthetic backbone modification of the polymer.

         <dc:description>The introduction of &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte (WiSE) concept opens a new horizon to aqueous electrochemistry that is benefited from the formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, such SEI still faces multiple challenges, including dissolution, mechanical damaging, and incessant reforming, which result in poor cycling stability. Here, we report a polymeric additive, polyacrylamide (PAM) that effectively stabilizes the interphase in WiSE. With the addition of 5 molar % PAM in 21 mol kg  &#8208;1  LiTFSI electrolyte, a LiMn  2  O  4  ||L&#8208;TiO  2  full cell exhibits enhanced cycling stability with 86% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C. The formation mechanism and evolution of PAM&#8208;assisted SEI was investigated using  operando  small angle neutron scattering and density functional theory calculations, which reveals that PAM minimizes the presence of free water molecules at the anode/electrolyte interface, accelerates the TFSI  &#8208;  anion decomposition, and densifies the structure of the SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Dynamic Covalent Bond Tailored Responsive Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive molecular devices based on dynamic covalent chemistry were fabricated, and the conductance measurement shows that three well&#8208;defined conductance states were observed with an ON/OFF ratio &#8776;10 in response to acid&#8208;based or photo&#8208;thermal stimuli of dynamic acyl hydrazone bond, while the ON&#8208;OFF ratio is &#8776;3 in self&#8208;assembled monolayer devices, which originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization.







Abstract
Responsive molecular devices are one of the core units for molecular electronics, and dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) provide the opportunity for the fabrication of responsive molecular devices. Herein we employ a single dynamic acyl hydrazone bond to fabricate tailored molecular devices using the scanning tunneling microscopy break&#8208;junction technique (STM&#8208;BJ) and the eutectic Ga&#8208;In technique (EGaIn). We found that the single&#8208;DCB&#8208;tailored molecular devices exhibited acid&#8208;base and/or photo&#8208;thermal response with three well&#8208;defined molecular conductance states. The reversible switching has the ON/OFF ratio of &#8776;10 between each state for single&#8208;molecule junctions and &#8776;3 for the SAMs&#8208;based molecular junctions. Combined with the density functional theory calculations, we revealed that the multiple conductance states of these molecular junctions originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization. Our work opens the avenue towards the design of tailored single&#8208;molecule electrical devices by implanting dynamic covalent bonds in molecular architectures.

         <title>Ultralow Volume Change of P2&#8208;Type Layered Oxide Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries with Controlled Phase Transition by Regulating Distribution of Na+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number and distribution of Na ions retained in lattice are two internal factors which affect structural evolution. Na ions can support the lattice structure like pillars, by regulating the distribution of Na ions, the process of phase transition can be controlled. As a result, the cathode can offer as high capacity as possible without obvious phase transition.







Abstract
Most P2&#8208;type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further leads to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na2/3MnxNix&#8722;1/3Co4/3&#8722;2xO2 (1/3&#8804;x&#8804;2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2&#8208;Na2/3Mn1/2Ni1/6Co1/3O2 cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#8197;V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9&#8201;%. Such a low strain is beneficial for cycling stability. The current work provides a new and effective route to regulate the structural evolution of the promising P2&#8208;type layered cathode for sodium ion batteries.

     alt="Ultralow Volume Change of P2-Type Layered Oxide Cathode for Na-Ion Batteries with Controlled Phase Transition by Regulating Distribution of Na+"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number and distribution of Na ions retained in lattice are two internal factors which affect structural evolution. Na ions can support the lattice structure like pillars, by regulating the distribution of Na ions, the process of phase transition can be controlled. As a result, the cathode can offer as high capacity as possible without obvious phase transition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most P2-type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further leads to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4/3&#8722;2&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1/3&#8804;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2-Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#8197;V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9&#8201;%. Such a low strain is beneficial for cycling stability. The current work provides a new and effective route to regulate the structural evolution of the promising P2-type layered cathode for sodium ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Construction of Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed reactions to construct atropisomerically enriched molecules has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. This Minireview summarizes progress made so far, and briefly states perspectives for the future advancement of this topic.







Abstract
Atropisomeric molecules have found proven applications and have shown promising potential in chemistry and medicine. The design of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed reactions to construct atropisomerically enriched molecules has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. These reactions include kinetic resolutions, asymmetric desymmetrizations, central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversions, and cycloadditions. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in NHC&#8208;based organic catalysis for access to atropisomers, and briefly states our personal perspectives on the future advancement of this topic. NHC catalysis has provided rich and unique reaction modes that have led to success in the asymmetric synthesis of central&#8208;chiral molecules. It is expected that similar success could also be achieved in developing NHC catalysis to prepare atropisomeric molecules, including those not easily accessible by other methods.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of Enterocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entering Nature's Design Office: The highly oxygenated natural product enterocin, which has to far resisted total synthetic attempts, was obtained in a biomimetic key step from triketone 1, which in turn was assembled from an L&#8208;arabinose&#8208;derived core fragment with a defined absolute configuration.







Abstract
The first chemical total synthesis of the highly oxygenated polyketide enterocin has been accomplished. The key step of the synthesis was a late&#8208;stage biomimetic reaction cascade involving two intramolecular aldol reactions in which each step proceeded in 52&#8201;% yield (averaged) and which established four of the seven stereogenic centers. The pivotal precursor for the cascade reaction was assembled from three readily available building blocks. A chiral dithioacetal with two stereogenic centers originating from L&#8208;arabinose represented the core fragment to both ends of which the other building blocks were attached by aldol reactions. The remaining stereogenic center was installed by Davis oxygenation immediately prior to the key step.

         <title>Active in Sleep: Iron Guanidine Catalyst Performs ROP on Dormant Side of ATRP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal catalysis combining two polymerization mechanisms in a one&#8208;pot synthesis enables facile production routes to block copolymers. An iron guanidine catalyst is able to copolymerize styrene via ATRP and lactide via ROP simultaneously. By using the FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium for ROP both mechanisms proceed in a controlled manner without interference.







Abstract
Copolymers are the answer to property limitations of homopolymers. In order to use the full variety of monomers available, catalysts active in more than one polymerization mechanism are currently investigated. Iron guanidine catalysts have shown to be extraordinarily active in ROP of lactide and herein prove their versatility by also promoting ATRP of styrene. The presented iron complex is the first polymerizing lactide and styrene simultaneously to a defined block copolymer in a convenient one&#8208;pot synthesis. Both mechanisms work hand in hand with ROP using the dominantly present FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium. This orthogonal copolymerization by a benign iron catalyst opens up new pathways to biocompatible polymerization procedures broadening the scope of ATRP applications.

         <title>Exquisite Vesicular Nanomedicine by Paclitaxel Mediated Co&#8208;assembly with Camptothecin Prodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exquisite vesicular nanomedicine with ultrahigh drug loading content of paclitaxel (PTX) (up to 72.3&#177;1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;%) by a co&#8208;assembly strategy with another amphiphilic prodrug (Evans blue conjugated camptothecin, EB&#8208;CPT) is reported. The optimized ECX NVs exhibited a prominent synergistic effect between PTX and CPT against colorectal HCT116 cancer cells for improved combination therapy both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
We report that the self&#8208;assembly of drug amphiphiles, Evans blue conjugated camptothecin prodrug (EB&#8208;CPT), can be modulated by another anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), resulting in ultrahigh quality of nanovesicles (NVs) with uniform shape and diameters of around 80&#8197;nm with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, denoted as ECX NVs. Significantly, the co&#8208;assembly of EB&#8208;CPT and PTX without adding other excipients has nearly 100&#8201;% drug loading efficiency (DLE) and ultrahigh drug loading content (DLC) of PTX alone of up to 72.3&#177;1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;% which, to our best knowledge, is among the highest level reported in literature. Moreover, the ECX NVs with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:2 showed remarkable combination index of 0.59 at a level of 50&#8201;% efficacy against HCT116 cells in vitro and greatly improved tumor inhibition effect in vivo compared with two clinically approved CPT&#8208; and PTX&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines (Onivyde and Abraxane) individually and their combinations.

         <title>High Mobility Organic Lasing Semiconductor with Crystallization&#8208;Enhanced Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high mobility organic lasing semiconductor of 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) with crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission is demonstrated. The light emitting transistor based on an individual LD&#8208;1 nanowire crystal gives typical electrically induced emission. This work provides a new concept for developing superior organic lasering semiconductors to advance research of electrically&#8208;driven ultrasmall integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.







Abstract
The development of high mobility organic laser semiconductors with strong emission is of great scientific and technical importance, but challenging. Herein, we present a high mobility organic laser semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) showing unique crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission guided by elaborately modulating its crystal growth process. The obtained one&#8208;dimensional nanowires of LD&#8208;1 show outstanding integrated properties including: high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching 80&#8201;%, high charge carrier mobility of 0.08&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Fabry&#8208;Perot lasing characters with a low threshold of 86&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high&#8208;quality factor of &#8776;2400. Furthermore, electrically induced emission was obtained from an individual LD&#8208;1 crystal nanowire&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting transistor due to the recombination of holes and electrons simultaneously injected into the nanowire, which provides a good platform for the study of electrically pumped organic lasers and other related ultrasmall integrated electrical&#8208;driven photonic devices.

The obtained one-dimensional nanowires of LD-1 show outstanding integrated properties including: high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching 80&#8201;%, high charge carrier mobility of 0.08&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Fabry-Perot lasing characters with a low threshold of 86&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a high-quality factor of &#8776;2400. Furthermore, electrically induced emission was obtained from an individual LD-1 crystal nanowire-based light-emitting transistor due to the recombination of holes and electrons simultaneously injected into the nanowire, which provides a good platform for the study of electrically pumped organic lasers and other related ultrasmall integrated electrical-driven photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Radical Stabilization of a Tripyridinium&#8211;Triazine Molecule Enables Reversible Storage of Multiple Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tripyridinium&#8211;triazine molecule featuring multiple redox centers was developed with a capacity as high as six electrons per molecule. The electronic coupling between the pyridinium and triazine units can effectively delocalize the charge of the radicals, thereby stabilizing the reactive intermediate and enabling reversible storage of multiple electrons.







Abstract
A novel organic molecule, 2,4,6&#8208;tris[1&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridiniumyl]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine hexachloride, was developed as a reversible six&#8208;electron storage electrolyte for use in an aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB). Physicochemical characterization reveals that the molecule evolves from a radical to a biradical and finally to a quinoid structure upon accepting four electrons. Both the diffusion coefficient and the rate constant were sufficiently high to run a flow battery with low concentration and kinetics polarization losses. In a demonstration unit, the assembled flow battery affords a high specific capacity of 33.0&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 and a peak power density of 273&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the rational design of electroactive organics that can manipulate multi&#8208;electron transfer in a reversible way, which will pave the way to development of energy&#8208;dense, manageable and low&#8208;cost ARFBs.

         <title>Unmasking Steps in Intramolecular Aromatic Hydroxylation by a Synthetic Nonheme Oxoiron(IV) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonheme FeIV=O complex 2&#8208;syn (in green circle) can be generated from the reaction of its precursor [FeII(Bn3MC)]2+ (1) with an oxo&#8208;transfer agent. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8208;syn decays to form the major FeIII&#8722;OAr oxidation product 3 (in blue circle) and regenerates its FeII(Bn3MC)2+ precursor (in red circle) in a 2:1 ratio. This observed stoichiometry demonstrates for the first time the electron flow required to effect this novel transformation.







Abstract
In this study, a methyl group on the classic tetramethylcyclam (TMC) ligand framework is replaced with a benzylic group to form the metastable [FeIV(Osyn)(Bn3MC)]2+ (2&#8208;syn; Bn3MC=1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) species at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The decay of 2&#8208;syn with time at 25&#8201;&#176;C allows the unprecedented monitoring of the steps involved in the intramolecular hydroxylation of the ligand phenyl ring to form the major FeIII&#8722;OAr product 3. At the same time, the FeII(Bn3MC)2+ (1) precursor to 2&#8208;syn is re&#8208;generated in a 1:2 molar ratio relative to 3, accounting for the first time for all the electrons involved and all the Fe species derived from 2&#8208;syn as shown in the following balanced equation: 3&#8201;[FeIV(O)(LPh)]2+ (2&#8208;syn)&#8594;2&#8201;[FeIII(LOAr)]2+ (3)+[FeII(LPh)]2+ (1)+H2O. This system thus serves as a paradigm for aryl hydroxylation by FeIV=O oxidants described thus far. It is also observed that 2&#8208;syn can be intercepted by certain hydrocarbon substrates, thereby providing a means to assess the relative energetics of aliphatic and aromatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation in this system.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Computational Evaluation of Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Cages to Aid in System Design**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the development of sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts, low&#8208;symmetry metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages assembled from unsymmetrical ligands are of emerging interest. Designing systems to avoid forming isomeric mixtures, however, is challenging. We report the use of a rapid computational workflow to predict self&#8208;assembly outcomes, informing experimental decisions and optimising synthetic realisation of low&#8208;symmetry, cis&#8208;Pd2L4 cages.







Abstract
Unsymmetrical ditopic ligands can self&#8208;assemble into reduced&#8208;symmetry Pd2L4 metallo&#8208;cages with anisotropic cavities, with implications for high specificity and affinity guest&#8208;binding. Mixtures of cage isomers can form, however, resulting in undesirable system heterogeneity. It is paramount to be able to design components that preferentially form a single isomer. Previous data suggested that computational methods could predict with reasonable accuracy whether unsymmetrical ligands would preferentially self&#8208;assemble into single cage isomers under constraints of geometrical mismatch. We successfully apply a collaborative computational and experimental workflow to mitigate costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error synthetic approaches. Our rapid computational workflow constructs unsymmetrical ligands and their Pd2L4 cage isomers, ranking the likelihood for exclusively forming cis&#8208;Pd2L4 assemblies. From this narrowed search space, we successfully synthesised four new, low&#8208;symmetry, cis&#8208;Pd2L4 cages.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of the Aqueous Reaction of Organic Peroxides with HSO3&#8722; on the Surface of a Water Droplet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic peroxide&#8211;HSO3&#8722; reaction at the aqueous surface proceeds through two pathways, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. The results have important atmospheric implications.







Abstract
Aqueous reactions between organic peroxides and SO2 are of intense interest in atmospheric science because of their ubiquitous implications for sulfate formation in secondary aerosols. However, the relative yields of the reaction products (inorganic vs. organic sulfates) remain controversial (i.e., 90&#8201;% vs. 40&#8211;70&#8201;% for inorganic sulfate) due in part to the lack of understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, our computational results suggest that the reactions of HSO3&#8722; (dissolved SO2) with organic peroxides are initiated on the surface of water nanodroplets and then proceed under two reaction pathways, in which the S atom of HSO3&#8722; attacks either the O1 or O2 atom of the peroxide group &#8208;O(O2)O(O1)H, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. Notably, we find that thse reaction initiated by O1 atom exhibits a relatively low energy barrier and high reaction rate, which favours the formation of inorganic sulfate.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent hemicyanines, known for their structural diversity, high fluorescence quantum yields, and good biocompatibility, are attractive scaffolds for the construction of activatable optical probes for disease diagnosis. This Review discusses the design strategies and sensing mechanisms of these probes, with an emphasis on their applications in early disease detection and imaging&#8208;guided therapies.







Abstract
Molecular activatable probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence play a critical role in in vivo imaging of biomarkers for drug screening and disease diagnosis. With structural diversity and high fluorescence quantum yields, hemicyanine dyes have emerged as a versatile scaffold for the construction of activatable optical probes. This Review presents a survey of hemicyanine&#8208;based NIR activatable probes (HNAPs) for in vivo imaging and early diagnosis of diseases. The molecular design principles of HNAPs towards activatable optical signaling against various biomarkers are discussed with a focus on their broad applications in the detection of diseases including inflammation, acute organ failure, skin diseases, intestinal diseases, and cancer. This progress not only proves the unique value of HNAPs in preclinical research but also highlights their high translational potential in clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Alkynes to Access Chiral gem&#8208;(Borylsilyl)alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of alkynes is developed to access synthetically versatile chiral gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes with Co(acac)2 and (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Ferrocelane. A range of terminal alkynes react to afford the corresponding gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation and hydroboration of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a cobalt catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Ferrocelane. A variety of terminal alkynes undergo this asymmetric transformation, affording the corresponding gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkane products with high enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee). This one&#8208;pot reaction combines (E)&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of alkynes and consecutive enantioselective hydroboration of (E)&#8208;vinylsilanes with one chiral cobalt catalyst. This protocol represents the most straightforward approach to access versatile chiral gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes from readily available alkynes with commercially available cobalt salt and chiral ligand.

         <title>Understanding and Engineering the Stereoselectivity of Humulene Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AsR6 is a type I sesquiterpene cyclase with very low homology to other terpene cyclases. It has a unique bi&#8208;magnesium diphosphate binding site and thus lacks the canonical terpene cyclase aspartate&#8208;rich signature sequences. One magnesium is replaced by the &#1013;&#8208;ammonium ion of a conserved lysine. AsR6 can use FPP and both enantiomers of NPP as substrate. In addition, a single mutation directs formation of 2E or 2Z humulene with very high selectivity.







Abstract
The non&#8208;canonical terpene cyclase AsR6 is responsible for the formation of 2E,6E,9E&#8208;humulene during the biosynthesis of the tropolone sesquiterpenoid (TS) xenovulene A. The structures of unliganded AsR6 and of AsR6 in complex with an in crystallo cyclized reaction product and thiolodiphosphate reveal a new farnesyl diphosphate binding motif that comprises a unique binuclear Mg2+&#8208;cluster and an essential K289 residue that is conserved in all humulene synthases involved in TS formation. Structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AsR6 and its homologue EupR3 identify a single residue, L285/M261, that controls the production of either 2E,6E,9E&#8208; or 2Z,6E,9E&#8208;humulene. A possible mechanism for the observed stereoselectivity was investigated using different isoprenoid precursors and results demonstrate that M261 has gatekeeping control over product formation.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveals In Situ Behaviors of Multiple Components in Aerosol Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mass spectrometry imaging strategy to map and quantify the sub&#8208;organ distribution and translocation of inhaled carbonaceous aerosol is reported. The method provides not only spatial biodistribution of carbonaceous aerosol at sub&#8208;organ level, but also chemical changes of multiple components.







Abstract
The inhalation of atmospheric particles is deleterious to human health. However, as a complex mixture, tracing the behaviors of multiple components from real aerosol particles is crucial but unachievable by the existing methods. Here, taking advantage of the intrinsic fingerprints of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in carbonaceous aerosol (CA) upon laser irradiation, we proposed a label&#8208;free mass spectrometry imaging method to visualize and quantify the deposition, translocation and component variation of CA in organs. With this method, the heterogeneous deposition, clearance and release behavior of CA in lung, that more OC was released in parenchyma and OC was cleared faster than EC, was observed. The translocation of CA to extrapulmonary organs including kidney, liver, spleen and even brain was also verified and quantified. By comparing the ratio of OC to EC, an organ&#8208;specific release behavior of OC from CA during circulation was revealed. In orthotopic lung and liver tumor, OC was found to penetrate more into tumor foci than EC. This technique provides deeper information for understanding the systemic health effects of aerosol particles.

         <title>Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a better understanding of the interaction between allosteric and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of Abl. Using a protease accessibility assay we developed, we determined the global conformation of Abl when bound to Abl inhibitors. We found that synergy between ATP&#8208;competitive and allosteric inhibitors of Abl required a &#8220;matched&#8221; kinase conformation.







Abstract
Allosteric inhibitors of Abl kinase are being explored in the clinic, often in combination with ATP&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl kinase. However, there are conflicting data on whether both ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and myristoyl&#8208;site allosteric inhibitors can simultaneously bind Abl kinase. Here, we determine whether there is synergy or antagonism between ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors of Abl. We observe that clinical ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors are not synergistic with allosteric ABL inhibitors, however, conformation&#8208;selective ATP&#8208;site inhibitors that modulate the global conformation of Abl can afford synergy. We demonstrate that kinase conformation is the key driver to simultaneously bind two compounds to Abl kinase. Finally, we explore the interaction of allosteric and conformation selective ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors in a series of biochemical and cellular assays.

         <title>In Vivo Tracking of Cell Viability for Adoptive Natural Killer Cell&#8208;Based Immunotherapy by Ratiometric NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a ROS&#8208;sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence probe to label NK cells was reported for tracking cell viability in adoptive NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy. Intracellular ROS generation of dying NK cells, caused by exogenous physical or chemical factors, such as hypoxia, starvation, and oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment, results in a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence signal in vivo, which holds considerable potential for adoptive NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of natural killer (NK) cells&#8208;based immunotherapy is greatly related with the survival of transplanted NK cells. However, no effective strategy was reported to monitor NK cell viability in adoptive immunotherapy in vivo. Herein, we develop a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging strategy to quantitively track and visualize the adoptive NK cell viability in vivo in real&#8208;time. The nanoprobe consists of lanthanide&#8208;based down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP) coated with IR786s, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive to NIR dye, which was directly labeled with NK cells. Upon cell death, the excessive ROS generation occurred within NK cells, along with IR786s degradation, turning on NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 808&#8208;nm excitation, while the fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 980&#8208;nm excitation was stable. Such an intracellular ROS&#8208;induced ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal was validated to correlate well with NK cell viability in vivo. Using this nanoreporter, we further demonstrated that co&#8208;treatment with IL&#8208;2, IL&#8208;15, and IL&#8208;21 could improve NK cell viability in vivo, achieving enhanced immunotherapy for orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, this strategy allows for longitudinal and quantitative tracking of NK cell viability in NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Using a ROS-sensitive NIR-II fluorescence probe to label NK cells was reported for tracking cell viability in adoptive NK cell-based immunotherapy. Intracellular ROS generation of dying NK cells, caused by exogenous physical or chemical factors, such as hypoxia, starvation, and oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment, results in a ratiometric NIR-II fluorescence signal in vivo, which holds considerable potential for adoptive NK cell-based immunotherapy.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;Metal Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted worldwide attention owing to the high energy density of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Nevertheless, the actual energy density of LMBs is often inferior to that of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This Review describes crucial parameters of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs, summarizes the recent advances in electrolyte systems for practical LMBs, and provides new perspectives for the design of novel electrolytes for LMBs.







Abstract
Given the limitations inherent in current intercalation&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries, much research attention has focused on potential successors to Li&#8208;ion batteries such as lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries. In order to realize the potential of these batteries, the use of metallic lithium as the anode is essential. However, there are severe safety hazards associated with the growth of Li dendrites, and the formation of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; during cycles leads to the inevitable loss of active Li, which in the end is undoubtedly detrimental to the actual energy density of Li&#8208;metal batteries. For Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, a low negative/positive ratio (N/P ratio), a electrolyte/cathode ratio (E/C ratio) along with a high&#8208;voltage cathode is prerequisite. In this Review, we summarize the development of new electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, revisit the design criteria of advanced electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries and provide perspectives on future development of electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Liquids for Enhanced CO2 Adsorption and Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionization strategy has been developed to fabricate a porous MOF liquid, which shows large adsorption of CO2. The adsorbed CO2 can subsequently be slowly released and efficiently utilized to synthesize, for example, cyclic carbonates.







Abstract
The unique applications of porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) liquids with permanent porosity and fluidity have attracted significant attention. However, fabrication of porous MOF liquids remains challenging because of the easy intermolecular self&#8208;filling of the cavity or the rapid settlement of porous hosts in hindered solvents that cannot enter their pores. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the fabrication of a MOF liquid (Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL) by surface ionization of an imidazolium&#8208;functionalized framework with a sterically hindered poly(ethylene glycol) sulfonate (PEGS) canopy. The Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL obtained in this way has a CO2 adsorption approximately 14 times larger than that of pure PEGS. Distinct from a porous MOF solid counterpart, the stored CO2 in Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL can be slowly released and efficiently utilized to synthesize cyclic carbonates in the atmosphere. This is the first example of the use of a porous MOF liquid as a CO2 storage material for catalysis. It offers a new method for the fabrication of unique porous liquid MOFs with functional behaviors in various fields of gas adsorption and catalysis.

         <title>A High&#8208;Voltage Zn&#8211;Organic Battery Using a Nonflammable Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8211;organic battery using a nonflammable organic electrolyte shows a long lifetime (2400&#8197;cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading of 16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the cathode and high Zn&#8208;utilization (3.5&#8201;%) in the anode. TFMS=trifluoromethanesulfonate, TEP=triethyl phosphate, PC=propylene carbonate.







Abstract
Owing to undesired Zn corrosion and the formation of Zn dendrites in aqueous electrolytes, most of the examples of aqueous Zn batteries with reported excellent performance are achieved with low Zn&#8208;utilization (&lt;0.6&#8201;%) in the anode and low mass&#8208;loading (&lt;3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in the cathode. Herein, we propose a new organic electrolyte for Zn batteries, which contains a zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn&#8208;TFMS) salt and a mixed solvent consisting of propylene carbonate (PC) and triethyl phosphate (TEP). We demonstrate that this electrolyte with an optimized PC/TEP ratio not only exhibits high ionic conductivity and a wide stable potential window, but also facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping. In particular, the TEP solvent makes the electrolyte nonflammable. Finally, a 2&#8197;V Zn//polytriphenylamine composite (PTPAn) battery is fabricated with the optimized electrolyte; it shows a high rate and a long lifetime (2400&#8197;cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading (16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of PTPAn in the cathode and with a high Zn&#8208;utilization (3.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesized Catalyst towards Acidic Oxygen Reduction by Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst possessing well&#8208;defined active sites and intrinsic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction was prepared by a pyrolysis&#8208;free route. The performance of the catalyst was explored in acidic media by introducing a deprotonation process.







Abstract
Acidic oxygen reduction is vital for renewable energy devices such as fuel cells. However, many aspects of the catalytic process are still uncertain&#8212;especially the large difference in activity in acidic and alkaline media. Thus, the design and synthesis of model catalysts to determine the active centers and the inactivation mechanism are urgently needed. We report a pyrolysis&#8208;free synthesis route to fabricate a catalyst (CPF&#8208;Fe@NG) for oxygen reduction in acidic conditions. By introducing a deprotonation process, we extended the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity from alkaline to acidic conditions. CPF&#8208;Fe@NG demonstrated outstanding performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 853&#8197;mV (vs. RHE) and good stability after 10000&#8197;cycles in 1&#8197;M HClO4. The pyrolysis&#8208;free route could also be used to assemble fuel cells, with a maximum power density of 126&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our findings offer new insights into the ORR process to optimize catalysts for both mechanistic studies and practical applications.

         <title>A Minimal Load&#8208;and&#8208;Lock RuII Luminescent DNA Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using single&#8208;molecule optical tweezers and confocal microscopy we perform kinetic analysis of a novel dinuclear ruthenium(II) DNA imaging probe. Reversable binding is observed on relaxed DNA, however on stretching DNA, threading can occur, resulting in high affinity stable binding. Threading is highly stereoisomer specific and dependent on DNA supercoiling state. This DNA probe has exciting potential for DNA structure specific imaging.







Abstract
Threading intercalators bind DNA with high affinities. Here, we describe single&#8208;molecule studies on a cell&#8208;permeant luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complex that has been previously shown to thread only into short, unstable duplex structures. Using optical tweezers and confocal microscopy, we show that this complex threads and locks into force&#8208;extended duplex DNA in a two&#8208;step mechanism. Detailed kinetic studies reveal that an individual stereoisomer of the complex exhibits the highest binding affinity reported for such a mono&#8208;intercalator. This stereoisomer better preserves the biophysical properties of DNA than the widely used SYTOX Orange. Interestingly, threading into torsionally constrained DNA decreases dramatically, but is rescued on negatively supercoiled DNA. Given the &#8220;light&#8208;switch&#8221; properties of this complex on binding DNA, it can be readily used as a long&#8208;lived luminescent label for duplex or negatively supercoiled DNA through a unique &#8220;load&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221; protocol.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven and Enzyme&#8208;Regulated Redox&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fuel&#8208;driven and enzyme&#8208;regulated supramolecular hydrogel has the inherent ability to tune its behavior from a redox&#8208;responsive to a self&#8208;regulating system. Feedback arises due to in situ formation of oxidation fuel in the chemical reaction network.







Abstract
Chemical reaction networks (CRN) embedded in hydrogels can transform responsive materials into complex self&#8208;regulating materials that generate feedback to counter the effect of external stimuli. This study presents hydrogels containing the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) and ferrocene (Fc) host&#8211;guest pair as supramolecular crosslinks where redox&#8208;responsive behavior is driven by the enzyme&#8211;fuel couples horse radish peroxidase (HRP)&#8211;H2O2 and glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8211;d&#8208;glucose. The hydrogel can be tuned from a responsive to a self&#8208;regulating supramolecular system by varying the concentration of added reduction fuel d&#8208;glucose. The onset of self&#8208;regulating behavior is due to formation of oxidation fuel in the hydrogel by a cofactor intermediate GOx[FADH2]. UV/Vis spectroscopy, rheology, and kinetic modeling were employed to understand the emergence of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior and reveal the programmable negative feedback response of the hydrogel, including the adaptation of its elastic modulus and its potential as a glucose sensor.

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hydroxylation and Alkoxylation of Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation of aryl fluorides via &#951;6&#8208;coordination was achieved. This method was also applicable in the alkoxylation. A Meisenheimer&#8208;type intermediate was successfully isolated and well characterized. Density functional theory calculations and mechanistic studies suggested a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile for the SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is a powerful strategy for incorporating a heteroatom into an aromatic ring by displacement of a leaving group with a nucleophile, but this method is limited to electron&#8208;deficient arenes. We have now established a reliable method for accessing phenols and phenyl alkyl ethers via catalytic SNAr reactions. The method is applicable to a broad array of electron&#8208;rich and neutral aryl fluorides, which are inert under classical SNAr conditions. Although the mechanism of SNAr reactions involving metal arene complexes is hypothesized to involve a stepwise pathway (addition followed by elimination), experimental data that support this hypothesis is still under exploration. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest either a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile. Notably, we isolated a rhodium &#951;5&#8208;cyclohexadienyl complex intermediate with an sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon bearing both a nucleophile and a leaving group.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Regulated Electron Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Enhanced Reactivity in Fe4S4&#8208;Mediated Redox Reaction of the Dph2 Enzyme During the Biosynthesis of Diphthamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncovered that the spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer and exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity are involved in Fe4S4&#8208;mediated reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond in Dph2, and that the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block may act as the redox site to mediate the electron donation and reception during the redox catalysis.







Abstract
The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;dependent radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8211;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe&#8208;4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low&#8208;energy and a high&#8208;energy groups, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the driving force of Fe4&#8722;C(&#947;) bonding, the net spin on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the opposite spin electron from the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer results in the exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity in the lower&#8208;energy group compared with those in the higher&#8208;energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in RS enzymes.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;PROTAC Conjugates (APCs) for Tumor&#8208;Specific Targeting in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed to improve the tumor specific targeting and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. This strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in PROTAC&#8208;based drug development.







Abstract
Development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is emerging as a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation. However, the drug development using the heterobifunctional PROTAC molecules is generally limited by poor membrane permeability, low in vivo efficacy and indiscriminate distribution. Herein an aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugation approach was developed as a novel strategy to improve the tumor&#8208;specific targeting ability and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. As proof of concept, the first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed by conjugating a BET&#8208;targeting PROTAC to the nucleic acid aptamer AS1411 (AS) via a cleavable linker. Compared with the unmodified BET PROTAC, the designed molecule (APR) showed improved tumor targeting ability in a MCF&#8208;7 xenograft model, leading to enhanced in vivo BET degradation and antitumor potency and decreased toxicity. Thus, the APC strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in the development of PROTAC&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>TEMPO Containing Radical Polymonothiocarbonate Polymers with Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Regularities: Synthesis, Characterization, and Electrical Conductivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of atactic and isotactic radical polymonothiocarbonates by the copolymerization of a TEMPO derived epoxide and carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the presence of the metal catalyst (salen)CrCl/PPNCl is reported. It was uncovered that there is a significant enhancement of the electrical conductivity of the isotactic copolymer (ca. 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) as compared to that of the atactic copolymer (10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxidanyl) (TEMPO) appended polymonothiocarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of (4&#8208;glycidyloxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl) (GTEMPO) in the presence of carbonyl sulfide under ambient conditions. We have prepared the atactic and isotactic versions of this polymer, using enantiopure R or S forms of the GTEMPO monomer in the latter instances. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed both oxidation and reduction events that were characteristic of TEMPO radicals. Electrical conductivity of these polymers was measured as solid&#8208;state films after annealing the samples above their glass transition temperatures. At room temperature the isotactic polymer shows much greater conductivity (ca. 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than the atactic (ca. 10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), attributed to the well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and regulated charge transport pathway of isotactic polymer chains in contrast to the irregular structure of the atactic counterpart.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane Using Stable Solid Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and robust light&#8208;driven nonoxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) to ethane and hydrogen at room temperature was developed. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free GaN:ZnO solid solution drove NOCM with a high conversion rate, high selectivity, long&#8208;term stability, and superior coke resistance, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously in thermal catalysis.







Abstract
Achieving efficient and direct conversion of methane under mild conditions is of great significance for innovations in the chemical industry. However, the efficiency and lifetime of most catalysts remain too far from practical requirements, since it is difficult to break the first C&#8722;H bond of methane as well as to suppress the following complete dehydrogenation (or overoxidation) and the resulting carbonaceous deposition (or CO2). Here, we report that wurtzite GaN:ZnO solid solutions exhibit unique and unprecedented photocatalytic performances for the nonoxidative coupling of methane at room temperature, exclusively generating ethane with nearly stoichiometric H2. High conversion rate (&gt;330&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;70&#8197;h), and superior coke&#8208;resistance were achieved. At 293&#8197;K, the methane conversion exceeds 7&#8201;%, comparable to the equilibrium conversion of thermal catalysis at 910&#8197;K. Mechanistic studies revealed that the N&#8208;ZnGa&#8208;ON units and the absence of acid sites on the surface played crucial roles in reactivity and coke resistance, respectively.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Au55 with a Novel Structure and Remarkable CO2 Electroreduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold nanocluster [Au55(p&#8208;MBT)24(Ph3P)6](SbF6)3 (p&#8208;MBT=4&#8208;methylbenzenethiolate) features a face&#8208;centered cubic Au55 kernel. This cluster exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 94.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V. The exclusion of chloride is an effective strategy to generate new members of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
A Au55 nanocluster with the composition of [Au55(p&#8208;MBT)24(Ph3P)6](SbF6)3 (p&#8208;MBT=4&#8208;methylbenzenethiolate) is synthesized via direct reduction of gold&#8208;phosphine and gold&#8208;thiolate precursors. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that this Au55 nanocluster features a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Au55 kernel, different from the well&#8208;known two&#8208;shell cuboctahedral arrangement in Au55(Ph3P)12Cl6. The Au55 cluster shows a wide optical absorption band with optical energy gap (Eg=1.28&#8197;eV). It is found that the exclusion of chloride is crucial for the formation of the title cluster, otherwise rod&#8208;like [Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+ is obtained. The strategy to run synthetic reaction in the absence of halide leads to new members of phosphine/thiolate co&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters. The Au55 nanocluster exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO; the Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 94.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

         <title>Controlling the Covalent Reactivity of a Kinase Inhibitor with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, we introduce the combination of covalent inhibitors, targeting a cysteine in the vicinity of the ATP binding site of the c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) and diazocine photoswitches. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that our lead inhibitor is a poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitor in the dark and undergoes proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Covalent kinase inhibitors account for some of the most successful drugs that have recently entered the clinic and many others are in preclinical development. A common strategy is to target cysteines in the vicinity of the ATP binding site using an acrylamide electrophile. To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, it could be advantageous to control the reactivity of these electrophiles with light. Here, we introduce covalent inhibitors of the kinase JNK3 that function as photoswitchable affinity labels (PALs). Our lead compounds contain a diazocine photoswitch, are poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitors in the dark, and become effective covalent inhibitors after irradiation with visible light. Our proposed mode of action is supported by X&#8208;ray structures that explain why these compounds are unreactive in the dark and undergo proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following exposure to light.

         <title>Enabling Alkyl Thianthrenium Salts in Cross&#8208;Couplings by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl constitutes one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Here, the development of a series of thianthrenium salts, which act as reliable alkylation reagents, are ready to engage in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira reaction to build C(sp  3  )&#8722;C(sp) bonds under mild photoinduced conditions. Diverse alkyl thianthrenium salts, methyl and disubstituted thianthrenium salts are employed with great functional breadth, since sensitive Cl, Br and I are compatible and challenging to achieve by conventional approaches. The generality of the developed alkyl reagents has also been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Kumada reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds via Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridged bicyclic nitrogen scaffolds are conformational restricted analogues of important aminocarbo&#8208; and aminoheterocycles. Fixation of functional groups in a biologically active conformation provides efficient and selective ligands for various targets, featuring improved ADME parameters. Long synthetic sequences relying on traditional organic chemistry currently limit the drug discovery process. New step&#8208;economic synthetic procedures are therefore highly sought after.







Abstract
Bridged nitrogen bicyclic skeletons have been accessed via unprecedented site&#8208; and diastereoselective orthogonal tandem catalysis from readily accessible reactants in a step economic manner. Directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination of aminocyclohexane with gem&#8208;dibromoalkenes, followed by a consecutive intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed amidation of the 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;alkenylated product delivers the interesting normorphan skeleton. The tandem protocol can be applied on substituted aminocyclohexanes and aminoheterocycles, easily providing access to the corresponding substituted, aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;analogues. The Cu catalyst of the Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction additionally avoids off&#8208;cycle Pd catalyst scavenging by alkenylated reaction product. The picolinamide directing group stabilizes the enamine of the 7&#8208;alkylidenenormorphan, allowing further product post functionalizations. Without Cu catalyst, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination is achieved.

         <title>Glycopolymer Microarrays with Sub&#8208;Femtomolar Avidity for Glycan Binding Proteins Prepared by Grafted&#8208;To/Grafted&#8208;From Photopolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;femtomolar avidity with glycan binding protein is achieved in a glycan microarray architecture that controls precisely carbohydrate density and valency. The biomimetic glycopolymers are prepared via a new surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, termed &#8220;grafted&#8208;to/grafted&#8208;from radical photopolymerization&#8221; that was optimized using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization.







Abstract
We report a novel glycan array architecture that binds the mannose&#8208;specific glycan binding protein, concanavalin&#8197;A (ConA), with sub&#8208;femtomolar avidity. A new radical photopolymerization developed specifically for this application combines the grafted&#8208;from thiol&#8211;(meth)acrylate polymerization with thiol&#8211;ene chemistry to graft glycans to the growing polymer brushes. The propagation of the brushes was studied by carrying out this grafted&#8208;to/grafted&#8208;from radical photopolymerization (GTGFRP) at &gt;400 different conditions using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization on surfaces. The effect of brush height and the grafting density of mannosides on the binding of ConA to the brushes was studied systematically, and we found that multivalent and cooperative binding account for the unprecedented sensitivity of the GTGFRP brushes. This study further demonstrates the ease with which new chemistry can be tailored for an application as a result of the advantages of hypersurface photolithography.

         <title>Electrochemical Modulation of Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Mediated Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical strategy to locally synthesize carbon monoxide (CO), a gaseous messenger molecule, with tunable kinetics is devised. By integrating this strategy with fiber&#8208;based fabrication, diverse CO&#8208;dependent signaling pathways in genetically engineered cells or neurons can be modulated at the microscale.







Abstract
Despite the critical role played by carbon monoxide (CO) in physiological and pathological signaling events, current approaches to deliver this messenger molecule are often accompanied by off&#8208;target effects and offer limited control over release kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an electrochemical approach that affords on&#8208;demand release of CO through reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in the extracellular space. Electrocatalytic generation of CO by cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalysts modulates signaling pathways mediated by a CO receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase. Furthermore, by tuning the applied voltage during electrocatalysis, we explore the effect of the CO release kinetics on CO&#8208;dependent neuronal signaling. Finally, we integrate components of our electrochemical platform into microscale fibers to produce CO in a spatially&#8208;restricted manner and to activate signaling cascades in the targeted cells. By offering on&#8208;demand local synthesis of CO, our approach may facilitate the studies of physiological processes affected by this gaseous molecular messenger.

         <title>Identification of RNA base pairs and complete assignment of nucleobase resonances by 1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy at 100 kHz MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowledge of RNA structure, either in isolation or in complex, is fundamental to understand the mechanism of cellular processes. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight complexes and does not require crystallization; thus, it is well&#8208;suited to study RNA as part of large multicomponent assemblies. Recently, we solved the first structures of both RNA and an RNA&#8211;protein complex by ssNMR using conventional  13  C&#8208; and  15  N&#8208;detection. This approach is limited by the severe overlap of the RNA peaks together with the low sensitivity of multidimensional experiments. Here, we overcome the limitations in sensitivity and resolution by using  1  H&#8208;detection at fast MAS rates. We develop experiments that allow the identification of complete nucleobase spin&#8208;systems together with their site&#8208;specific base pair pattern using sub&#8208;milligram quantities of one uniformly labelled RNA sample. These experiments provide rapid access to RNA secondary structure by ssNMR in protein&#8211;RNA complexes of any size.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Functionalized Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic lithium (Li) is regarded as the ideal anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low electrochemical potential, highest theoretical energy density and low density. There are, however, still significant challenges to be addressed such as Li&#8208;dendrite growth and low interfacial stability, which impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. In order to circumvent these shortcomings, herein, we present a gel polymer electrolyte containing imidazolium ionic liquid end groups with a perfluorinated alkyl chain (F&#8208;IL) to achieve both high ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number by fundamentally altering the solubility of salt within the gel electrolyte through Lewis&#8208;acidic segments in the polymer backbone. Moreover, the presence of F&#8208;IL moieties decreased the binding affinity of Li cation towards the glycol chains, enabling a rapid transfer of Li cation within the gel network. These structural features enabled the immobilization of anions on the ionic liquid segments to alleviate the space&#8208;charge effect while promoting stronger anion coordination and weaker cation coordination in the Lewis&#8208;acidic polymers. Accordingly, we realized a high Li ion conductivity (9.16 &#215; 10  &#8722;3  S cm  &#8722;1  ) and high Li ion transference number of 0.69 simultaneously, along with a good electrochemical stability up to 4.55 V, while effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. Moreover, the gel polymer electrolyte exhibited stable cycling performance of the Li|Li symmetric cell of 9 mAh cm  &#8722;2  for more than 1800 hours and retained 86.7% of the original capacity after 250 cycles for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) full cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective detection of Cu+ ions in live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper is an essential trace element in living organisms with its levels and localisation being carefully managed by the cellular machinery. However, if misregulated, deficiency or excess of copper ions can lead to several diseases. Therefore, it is important to have reliable methods to detect, monitor and visualise this metal in cells. Herein we report a new optical probe based on BODIPY, which shows a switch&#8208;on in its fluorescence intensity upon binding to copper(I), but not in the presence of high concentration of other physiologically relevant metal ions. More interestingly, binding to copper(I) leads to significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the new probe, which can be used to visualize copper(I) pools in lysosomes of live cells  via  fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</dc:description>

         <title>The Dimethylbismuth Cation: Entry into Dative Bi&#8211;Bi Bonding and Unconventional Methyl Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation of simple, fundamentally important, and highly reactive organometallic compounds remains among the most challenging tasks in synthetic chemistry. The detailed characterization of such compounds is key to the discovery of novel bonding scenarios and reactivity. The dimethylbismuth cation, [BiMe  2  (SbF  6  )] (  1  ), has been isolated and characterized. Its reaction with BiMe  3  gives access to an unprecedented dative bond, a Bi&#8594;Bi donor/acceptor interaction. The exchange of methyl groups (arguably the simplest hydrocarbon moiety) between different metal atoms is among the most principal types of reactions in organometallic chemistry. The reaction of  1  with BiMe  3  enables an S  E  2(back) type methyl exchange, which is for the first time investigated in detail for isolable, (pseudo&#8208;)homoleptic main group compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Saucer[n]arenes: Synthesis, Structure, Complexation and Guest Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new kind of macrocycles denoted as saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) were synthesized by the one&#8208;pot condensation of 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene (2,7&#8208;DMN) and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TFA or catalytic BF  3  &#183;OEt  2  . With 1,1&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ium as the template, saucer[4]arene was selectively obtained. Crystal structures show that saucer[n]arenes are all composed of 2,7&#8208;DMN moiety bridged by the methylene groups at 1,6&#8208;positions, in which all of the 7&#8208;methoxy groups lie on one face, and all of the 2&#8208;methoxy groups lie on the other. Moreover, saucer[n]arenes exhibit strong fluorescence properties with the quantum yields of 19.6% and 23.4%, respectively. Saucer[n]arenes also form 1:1 complexes with various ammonium salts in both solution and solid states, and the association constant is up to 10  5  M  &#8208;1  in CDCl  3  . Interestingly, chiral quaternary ammonium salts can induce the chirality of the dynamically racemic inherently chiral saucer[n]arenes in solution, and thus show the mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism signals and the circularly polarized luminescence&#160;(CPL) properties, which will provide a new way to construct the CPL organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Microporous carbon nitride (C3N5.4) with new tetrazine based molecular structure for efficient adsorption of CO2 and water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous carbon nitrides with C3N5 and C3N6 stoichiometries created a new momentum in the field of organic metal&#8208;free semiconductors owing to their unique band structures and high basicity. Introducing microporosity instead of mesoporosity in these nanostructures may offer interesting surface and electronic properties which may be more suitable for the selective adsorption or sensing of small molecules. Here, we report on the preparation of a novel graphitic microporous carbon nitride with a tetrazine based chemical structure and the composition of C3N5.4 using ultra&#8208;stable Y zeolite as the template and aminoguanidine hydrochloride, a high nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule as the CN precursor. The spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the prepared material exhibits a new molecular structure, which comprises two tetrazines and one triazine rings in the unit cell and is thermodynamically stable. The resultant carbon nitride shows a surface area of 130.4 m2/g and demonstrates excellent CO2 adsorption per unit surface area of 47.54 &#956;mol/m2, the highest reported value among mesoporous carbon nitrides and the activated carbon, which is due to the existence of abundant free NH2 groups, basic sites and microporosity. The material also exhibits highly selective sensing over water molecule (151.1 mmol/g) and aliphatic hydrocarbons due to its unique microporous structure with a high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen moieties and recognizing ability towards small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing transition metal vacancy induced oxygen redox by Co2+/Co3+ redox and sodium&#8208;site doping for layered cathode materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic redox is an effective way to boost the energy density of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries. However, inherent rigid nature of the TMO6 (TM: transition metals) subunits in the layered materials makes it hardly tolerate the inner strains induced by lattice glide, especially at high voltage. Herein, P2&#8208;Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07&#9633;0.13]O2 (&#9633;: TM vacancy) is designed that contains vacancies in TM sites, and Mg ions in both TM and sodium sites. Vacancies make the rigid TMO6 octahedron become more asymmetric and flexible. Low valence Co2+/Co3+ redox couple stabilizes the electronic structure, especially at the charged state. Mg2+ in sodium sites can tune the interlayer spacing against O&#8208;O electrostatic repulsion. Time&#8208;resolved in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms that irreversible structure evolution is effectively suppressed during deep desodiation benefiting from the specific configuration. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that, deriving from the intrinsic vacancies, multiple local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; are superior in facilitating the oxygen redox for charge compensation than previously reported &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;Mg&#8221;. The resulted material delivers promising cycle stability and rate capability, with a long voltage plateau at 4.2 V contributed by oxygen, and can be well maintained even at high rates. The strategy will inspire new ideas in designing highly stable cathode materials with reversible anionic redox for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Powered Activatable Nanozyme Breaking pH and H2O2 Limitations for Treating Diabetic Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peroxidase&#8208;like activity&#160;of nanozymes is promising for chemodynamic&#160;therapy&#160;by catalyzing H  2  O  2  &#160;into &#183;OH. However, for most nanozymes, this activity&#160;is optimal just in acidic solutions, while the pH of most physiological systems is beyond 7.0 (even &gt;8.0 in chronic wounds) with inadequate H  2  O  2  . We herein communicate an activatable&#160;nanozyme&#160;with targeting capability&#160;to simultaneously break the local pH and H  2  O  2  &#160;limitations&#160;under physiological conditions. As a proof of the concept, aptamer&#8208;functionalized&#160;nanozymes, glucose oxidase&#160;and hyaluronic acid constitute&#160;an activatable nanocapsule &#8220;APGH&#8221;, which can be activated by bacteria&#8208;secreted hyaluronidase in infected wounds. Nanozymes&#160;bind onto bacteria&#160;through aptamer recognition, and glucose oxidation tunes local pH down and supplements H  2  O  2  &#160;for&#160;  in situ  &#160;generation&#160;of &#183;OH on bacteria&#160;surface. The activity switching and enhanced antibacterial effect of the nanocapsule&#160;were verified  &#160;in vitro  &#160;and in diabetic wounds. This strategy for directly regulating local microenvironment is generally accessible for nanozymes, and significant for facilitating biological applications of nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of the 6,10&#8208;Bicyclic Eunicellane Skeleton by the Bacterial Diterpene Synthase Bnd4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The eunicellane diterpenoids are a unique family of natural products seen in marine organisms, plants, and bacteria. We used a series of biochemical, bioinformatics, and theoretical experiments to investigate the mechanism of the first diterpene synthase known to form the eunicellane skeleton. Deuterium labeling studies and quantum chemical calculations support that Bnd4, from  Streptomyces  sp. (CL12&#8208;4), forms the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic skeleton through a 1,10cyclization, 1,3&#8208;hydride shift, and 1,14&#8208;cyclization cascade. Bnd4 also demonstrated sesquiterpene cyclase activity and the ability to prenylate small molecules. Bnd4 possesses a unique D  94  NxxxD motif and mutation experiments confirmed an absolute requirement for D94 as well as E169.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heteromeric Carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based Single Crystalline Crosslinked Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of large pore single&#8208;crystalline covalently linked organic frameworks is critical in revealing the detailed structure&#8208;property relationship with substrates. One emergent approach is to photo&#8208;crosslink hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular crystals. Introducing complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonded carboxylic acid building blocks is promising to construct large pore networks, but these molecules often form interpenetrated networks or non&#8208;porous solids. Herein, we introduced heteromeric carboxylic acid dimers to construct a non&#8208;interpenetrated molecular crystal. Crosslinking this crystal precursor with dithiols afforded a large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework HCOF&#8208;101. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed HCOF&#8208;101 as an interlayer connected hexagonal network, which possesses flexible linkages and large porous channels to host a hydrazone photoswitch. Multicycle Z/E&#8208;isomerization of the hydrazone took place reversibly within HCOF&#8208;101, showcasing the potential use of HCOF&#8208;101 for optical information storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Bending for Better: Flexible Organic Single Crystals with Controllable Curvature and Curvature&#8208;Related Conductivity for Customized Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic micro&#8208;devices of self&#8208;bending coronene crystals are developed to reveal an unexplored link between mechanical deformation and crystal function. First, a facile approach towards length/width/curvature&#8208;controllable micro&#8208;crystals through bottom&#8208;up solution crystallization was proposed for high processability and stability. The bending crystal devices show a significant increase beyond seven orders of magnitude in conductivity than the straight ones, providing the first example of deformation&#8208;induced function enhancement in crystal materials. Besides, double effects caused by bending, including the change of &#960; electron level as well as the enhancement of carrier mobility, were determined respectively by the X&#8208;ray photoelectric spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography to coexist, contributing to the conductivity improvement. Our findings will promote future creation of flexible organic crystal systems with deformation&#8208;enhanced functional features towards customized smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Topology Reinforced Synergistic Interactions among Nanoscale Molecular Clusters for Impact Resistance with Facile Processability and Recoverability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic conflicts between mechanical performances and processability are main challenges to develop cost&#8208;effective impact&#8208;resistant materials from polymers as well as their composites. Herein, sub&#8208;nanoscale molecular units, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSSs) are covalently integrated as side chains to polymers with rigid backbones. The 1D rigid topology imposes strong space confinements to realize synergistic physical interactions among POSS units, reinforcing the correlations among polymer chains. The afforded entanglement&#8208;free polymers, though possess low molecular weights, demonstrate unprecedented mechanical properties with ultra&#8208;stretchability, strengths with extremely high strain rate&#8208;dependence, superior impact&#8208;resistant capacities as well as feasible processability/recoverability. The hierarchical structures of the hybrid polymers enable the co&#8208;existence of multiple dynamic relaxation processes that are responsible for fast energy dissipation and high mechanical strengths. The effective synergistic correlations strategy is entirely distinct from that of covalent and supramolecular systems, which paves a new pathway for the design of advanced cluster&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Forrestiacids A and B, Pentaterpene Inhibitors of ACL and Lipogenesis: Extending the limits of Computational NMR Methods in the Structure Assignment of Complex Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Forrestiacids A (  1  ) and B (  2  ) are a novel class of [4+2] type pentaterpenoids derived from a rearranged lanostane moiety (dienophile) and an abietane unit (diene). These unprecedented molecules were isolated using guidance by molecular ion networking&#160;(MoIN) from  Pseudotsuga forrestii  , an endangered member of the Asian Douglas Fir Family. The intermolecular hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder adducts feature an unusual bicyclo[2.2.2]octene ring system. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, GIAO NMR calculations and DP4+ probability analyses, electronic circular dichroism calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This unique addition to the pentaterpene family represents the largest and the most complex molecule successfully assigned using computational approaches to predict accurately chemical shift values. Compounds  1  and  2  exhibited potent inhibitory activities (IC  50  s &lt; 5  &#956;  M) of ATP&#8208;citrate lyase (ACL), a new drug target for the treatment of glycolipid metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia. Validating this activity  1  effectively attenuated the  de novo  lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. These findings provide a new chemical class for development of potential therapeutic agents for ACL&#8208;related diseases with strong links to traditional medicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Genetics Reveals a Role of Squalene Synthase in TGF&#946; Signaling and Cardiomyogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis of the mesoderm cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, yet its molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. The present study resolves the initially perplexing effects of KY02111 on Wnt signaling and subsequently identifies squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111 and its optimized version KY&#8208;I. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946; signaling, but not Wnt signaling, and thereby recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited heart disease that involves a substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role of SQS in TGF&#946; signaling and cardiomyogenesis. KY02111 may find its use in ARVC modeling as well as serve as a chemical tool for studying TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogenides by Reduction of their Dioxides in Ultra&#8208;alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of chalcogen dioxides  Ch  O  2  (  Ch  = Se, Te) with As  2  O  3  in a 30 molar KOH hydroflux at about 200 &#176;C yielded crystals of potassium trichalcogenides K  2  Ch  3  with dimensions up to 2 cm. Arsenic trioxide acts as electron donor and is oxidized to arsenate(V). The new heterochalcogenide anion (TeSe  2  )  2&#8211;  formed when starting from SeO  2  and TeO  2  simultaneously. The compound K  2  TeSe  2  crystallizes isostructural to K  2  S  3  and K  2  Se  3  .

         <title>Crystal structure classification of copper&#8208;based sulphides as a tool for the design of inorganic functional materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research focusing on the interplay between structural features and transport properties in inorganic materials is of paramount importance for the identification, comprehension and optimisation of functional materials. In this respect, Earth&#8208;abundant copper sulphides have been receiving considerable attention from scientists as the urgency remains to discover and improve the efficiency of sustainable materials for energy applications. This proposed classification of copper sulphides, associated with block&#160;  p  &#160;and/or&#160;  d  &#160;elements, is based on their crystallographic features and the analysis of their transport properties. It provides guidelines to help estimating some properties of new materials (type of main charge carriers, thermal conductivity, transport mechanisms, etc.) by considering only their chemical composition and crystal structure. The classification relies essentially on recent work in the fields of thermoelectricity and photovoltaics and thorough crystal structure investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart 131I labeled self&#8208;illuminating photosensitizers for deep tumor imaging guided therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulating photosensitizers (PS) by Cerenkov radiation (CR) can overcome the light penetration limitation in traditional photodynamic therapy. However, separate injection of radiopharmaceuticals and PS could not guarantee their efficient interaction in tumor areas, while co&#8208;delivery of radionuclides and PS face the problem of nonnegligible phototoxicity in normal tissues. Here, we developed a  131  I&#8208;labled smart photosensitizer which was composed of pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (photosensitizer), diisopropylamino group (pH sensitive group),  131  I&#8208;labled tyrosine group (CR donor) as well as polyethylene glycol, and can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (  131  I&#8208;sPS NPs). The  131  I&#8208;sPS NPs showed low phototoxicity in normal tissues due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, but could selfproduce reactive oxygen species in tumor sites upon its disassembly. Upon intravenous injection, it showed great tumor inhibition capability in subcutaneous 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing Balb/c mice and orthotopic VX2 liver tumor bearing rabbit. We believed  131  I&#8208;sPS NPs could expand the application of CR and provide an effective strategy for deep tumor theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Pd0&#8208; and PdII&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations: Enantioselective Heck and Nucleopalladation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successive cyclization and cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl aryl iodides and alkyne&#8208;appended nucleophiles via an enantioselective domino&#8208;Heck and regioselective nucleopalladation is reported. Heterocycles originated from N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles were successful in conjunction with the enantioselective formation of dihydrobenzofurans, indolines, chromans, indanes, and polycyclic indolines.







Abstract
An enantioselective consecutive cyclization/coupling process, catalyzed by palladium is reported. Stereoinduction arises from an enantioselective carbopalladation, generating an intermediate which promotes a nucleopalladation step. The dual cyclization sequence was compatible with a variety of alkyne&#8208;tethered oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles, and a variety of alkenyl&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, to forge numerous bisheterocycles in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Gradient Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel Membranes as High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from an inherent high conductivity, excellent ion selectivity of 3D charged polymer networks, and a charge&#8208;induced ionic&#8208;diode gradient effect, all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel gradient membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion.







Abstract
Emerging asymmetric ionic membranes consisting of two different porous membranes show great superiority in harvesting clean and renewable osmotic energy. The main barriers constraining their applications are incompatible interfaces and a low interfacial ionic transport efficiency, which are detrimental to the long&#8208;term stability and improvement of the power density. Here, continuous&#8208;gradient all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. Besides an inherent high ion conductivity and excellent ion selectivity, the anti&#8208;swelling polyelectrolyte gradient membranes preserve the ionic diode effect of the asymmetric membranes to facilitate one&#8208;way ion diffusion but circumvent adverse interfacial effects. In consequence, they can present ultrahigh power densities of 7.87&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing seawater and river water, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.

         <dc:description>
A nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms was developed as a narrowband sky&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitter for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A design concept for inducing a synergetic effect on the luminescence function by exquisite multi&#8208;heteroatom hybridization is presented.







Abstract
Developing organic luminophores with unique capability of strong narrowband emission is both crucial and challenging for the further advancement of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system (BSBS&#8208;N1), which was strategically embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, was developed as a new multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. Narrowband sky&#8208;blue emission with a peak at 478&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum of 24&#8197;nm, and photoluminescence quantum yield of 89&#8201;% was obtained with BSBS&#8208;N1. Additionally, the spin&#8208;orbit coupling was enhanced by incorporating two sulfur atoms, thereby facilitating the spin&#8208;flipping process between the excited triplet and singlet states. OLEDs based on BSBS&#8208;N1 as a sky&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter achieved a high maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 21.0&#8201;%, with improved efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;C Biaryl atropisomers are important because of their prevalence in natural products and bioactive drug molecules. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such molecules has not developed significantly. Particularly, the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8208;C biaryl atropisomers via stereoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination remains unprecedented. Herein, the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the synthesis of N&#8208;C axially chiral biaryl molecules is presented. A broad spectrum of the N&#8208;C axially chiral compounds was afforded with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) and good yields (up to 98%).

         <title>Various Stacking Patterns of Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Cocrystals: Insight on&#160;Competitive Intermolecular Interactions and Control of Stacking Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We first demonstrate the rational control over the stacking patterns in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular assemblies using chemical modification. A target system is a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystal composed of 2&#8208;pyrrolidone (Py) and chloranilic acid (CA) with 2:1 composition (  PyCA  ). X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that various weak intersheet interactions give rise to a variety of metastable overlapping patterns comprised of the 2D assemblies mainly formed via hydrogen bonds, affording reversible and irreversible structural phase transitions. We successfully prepared cocrystals of Py and anilic acids bearing different halogens, in which 2D assemblies isostructural with those observed in  PyCA  exhibit various overlapping patterns. The order of stability for each overlapping pattern estimated using theoretical calculations of the intermolecular interactions did not completely coincide with those indicated by our experimental results, which can be explained by considering the entropic effect, i.e., the molecular motion of Py as detected using nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Molecular Sieve for High Selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Acetylene on Isolated Single Pd Atom Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation in an ethylene&#8208;rich gas stream is of great industrial importance. Herein, we construct isolated single Pd atom in a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (POMOF). The unique internal environment allows this POMOF to separate acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and confine it close to the single Pd atom. After semi&#8208;hydrogenation, the resulting ethylene is preferentially discharged from the pores, achieving a selectivity of 92.6%. First&#8208;principles simulations reveal that the adsorbed acetylene/ethylene molecules form hydrogen bond networks with oxygen atoms of SiW  12  O  40  4&#8208;  and create  dynamic  confinement regions, which preferentially release the produced ethylene. Besides, at the Pd site, the over&#8208;hydrogenation of ethylene exhibits a higher reaction energy barrier than the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined advantages of POMOF and single Pd atom provides an effective approach for the regulation of semi&#8208;hydrogenation selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxially Growth of Heterostructured   SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 with High Valence Mn3+/4+ for  I mproved Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterostructured catalysts show outstanding performance in electrochemical reactions for their beneficial interfacial properties. However, the rational design of heterostructured catalysts with the desired interfacial properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics is challenging. Herein, we developed a SrMn  3  O  6&#8722;x  &#8208;SrMnO  3  (SMO  x  &#8208;SMO) heterostructure through epitaxial growth, which demonstrated excellent electrocatalyst performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The formation of high valence Mn  3+/4+  is beneficial for promoting a positive shift in the d&#8208;band center position, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and resulting in improved catalytic activity. When  SMO  x  &#8208;SMO  was applied as air&#8208;electrode catalyst in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, a high output voltage and power density was achieved, with performance comparable to a battery prepared with Pt/C&#8208;IrO  2  air&#8208;electrode catalysts albeit with much better cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;assisted triphase photocatalysis over a multifunctional bilayer paper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis as one of the future environment technologies has been investigated for decades. Despite great efforts in catalyst engineering, the widely used powder dispersion and photoelectrode systems are still restricted by sluggish interfacial mass transfer and chemical processes. Here we develop a scalable bilayer paper from commercialized TiO  2  and carbon nanomaterials, self&#8208;supported at gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid interfaces for photothermal&#8208;assisted triphase photocatalysis. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species can be facilitated through fast oxygen diffusion over triphase interfaces, while the interfacial photothermal effect promotes the following free radical reaction for advanced oxidation of phenol. Under full spectrum irradiation, the triphase system shows 13 times higher reaction rate than diphase controlled system, achieving 88.4% mineralization of high concentration phenol within 90 min full spectrum irradiation. The bilayer paper also exhibits high stability over 40 times cycling experiments and sunlight driven feasibility, showing potentials for large scale photocatalytic applications by being further integrated into a triphase flow reactor.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Data&#8208;driven Design of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins: Database and Hierarchical Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most powerful asymmetric transformations in molecular synthesis. Although several privileged catalyst scaffolds are available, the catalyst development for asymmetric hydrogenation is still a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming process due to the lack of predictive catalyst design strategy. Targeting the data&#8208;driven design of asymmetric catalysis, we herein report the development of a standardized database that contains the detailed information of over 12000 literature asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins. This database provides a valuable platform for the machine learning applications in asymmetric catalysis. Based on this database, we developed a hierarchical learning approach to achieve predictive machine leaning model using only dozens of enantioselectivity data with the target olefin, which offers a useful solution for the few&#8208;shot learning problem and will facilitate the reaction optimization with new olefin substrate in catalysis screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating local electron density of iron single site by nitrogen vacancy for efficient photo&#8208;Fenton&#160;process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activity of heterogeneous photocatalytic H2O2  activation in Fenton&#8208;like process is closely related to the local electron density of reaction centre atoms. However, the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs arising from random charge transfer greatly restricts the oriented electron delivery to active center. Here we show a defect engineered iron single atom photocatalyst (Fe1&#8208;Nv/CN, single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon nitride with abundant nitrogen vacancies) for the activation of H2O2  under visible light illumination. Based on DFT calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy results, the engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as the electron trap sites, which can directionally drive the electrons to concentrate on Fe atoms. The formation of highly concentrated electrons density at Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2  conversion efficiency.

However, the recombination of electron-hole pairs arising from random charge transfer greatly restricts the oriented electron delivery to active center. Here we show a defect engineered iron single atom photocatalyst (Fe1-Nv/CN, single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon nitride with abundant nitrogen vacancies) for the activation of H2O2  under visible light illumination. Based on DFT calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy results, the engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as the electron trap sites, which can directionally drive the electrons to concentrate on Fe atoms. The formation of highly concentrated electrons density at Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2  conversion efficiency. Therefore, the optimized single atom catalyst exhibiting a higher ciprofloxacin degradation activity, which was up to 18 times that of pristine CN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PtSe2/Pt heterointerface with reduced coordination for boosted hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PtSe  2  is a typical noble metal dichalcogenide (NMD) that holds promising possibility for next&#8208;generation electronics and photonics. However, when applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it exhibits sluggish kinetics due to the insufficient capability of absorbing active species. Here, we construct PtSe  2  /Pt heterointerface to boost the reaction dynamics of PtSe  2  , enabled by an in&#8208;situ electrochemical method. It is found that Se vacancies are induced around the heterointerface, reducing the coordination environment. Correspondingly, the exposed Pt atoms at the very vicinity of Se vacancies are activated, with enhanced overlap with H 1s orbital. The adsorption of H  &#8226;  intermediate is thus strengthened, achieving near thermoneutral free energy change. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe  2  /Pt exhibits extraordinary HER activity even superior to Pt/C, with an overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA/cm  2  and a Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec. This work raises attention on NMDs toward HER and provides insights for the rational construction of novel heterointerfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Double double to double perovskite transformations in ternary manganese oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of cation ordering in ABX  3  perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we show that thermal transformations of AA&#8217;BB&#8217;O  6  double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A  0.5  A&#8217;  0.5  )  2  BB&#8217;O  6  double perovskites with fully disordered A/A&#8217; cations can be achieved under pressure in CaMnMnWO  6  and SmMnMnTaO  6  , enabling both polymorphs of each material to be recovered. This leads to a dramatic switch of magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order in double double perovskite CaMnMnWO  6  to spin glass behaviour in the highly frustrated double perovskite polymorph. Comparison of double double and double perovskite polymorphs of other materials will enable effects of cation order and disorder on other properties such as ferroelectricity and conductivity to be explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Linkers for Protein Chemical Synthesis through Solid&#8208;Phase Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18612-18618, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic approach was developed for the synthesis of proteins by solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation based on a tailor&#8208;made phosphatase&#8208;cleavable linker (see scheme). The size of the enzyme used directly correlates with the efficiency of the release of the synthesized protein. The method was applied to the synthesis of a 15&#8197;kDa polypeptide, the longest sequence ever synthesized through solid&#8208;phase native chemical ligation.







Abstract
The total synthesis of long proteins requires the assembly of multiple fragments through successive ligations. The need for intermediate purification steps is a strong limitation, particularly in terms of overall yield. One solution to this problem would be solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation (SPCL), for which a first peptide segment must be immobilized on a SPCL&#8208;compatible solid support through a linker that can be cleaved under very mild conditions to release the assembled protein. The cleavage of SPCL linkers has previously required chemical conditions sometimes incompatible with sensitive protein targets. Herein, we describe an alternative enzymatic approach to trigger cleavage under extremely mild and selective conditions. Optimization of the linker structure and use of a small enzyme able to diffuse into the solid support were key to the success of the strategy. We demonstrated its utility by the assembly of three peptide segments on the basis of native chemical ligation to afford a 15&#8197;kDa polypeptide.

Polymers exhibiting near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are prepared from four boron&#8208;difluoride&#8208;curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) and subsequent antibody conjugation enabled near&#8208;infrared immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast&#8208;cancer cells.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting polymers were prepared using four boron&#8208;difluoride&#8208;curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Well&#8208;defined polymers with molecular weights of &#8776;20&#8197;kDa and dispersities &lt;1.07 were produced and exhibited near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission in solution and in the solid state with photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) as high as 0.72 and 0.18, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy revealed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in polymers containing highly planar dopants, whereas room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence dominated with twisted species. Density functional theory demonstrated that rotation about the donor&#8211;acceptor linker can give rise to TADF, even where none would be expected based on calculations using ground&#8208;state geometries. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) gave NIR&#8208;emissive nanoparticles, and conjugation of these Pdots with antibodies enabled immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast&#8208;cancer cells.

         <title>Shadow Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy of Single Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18742-18749, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (SECL) microscopy is based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting layer, allowing to resolve subcellular organelles such as single functional mitochondria with remarkably sharp negative optical contrast. The statistical analysis of colocalization between SECL spots with the MitoTracker Deep Red dye and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH fluorescent biomarkers validates the reported methodology.







Abstract
Mitochondria are the subcellular bioenergetic organelles. The analysis of their morphology and topology is essential to provide useful information on their activity and metabolism. Herein, we report a label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting reactive layer to image single living mitochondria deposited on the electrode surface. The ECL mechanism of the freely&#8208;diffusing [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye with the sacrificial tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine coreactant restrains the light&#8208;emitting region to a micrometric thickness allowing to visualize individual mitochondria with a remarkable sharp negative optical contrast. The imaging approach named &#8220;shadow ECL&#8221; (SECL) reflects the negative imprint of the local diffusional hindrance of the ECL reagents by each mitochondrion. The statistical analysis of the colocalization of the shadow ECL spots with the functional mitochondria revealed by classical fluorescent biomarkers, MitoTracker Deep Red and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH, validates the reported methodology. The versatility and extreme sensitivity of the approach are further demonstrated by visualizing single mitochondria, which remain hardly detectable with the usual biomarkers. Finally, by alleviating problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity associated with conventional microscopy methods, SECL microscopy should find promising applications in the imaging of subcellular structures.

We have developed PA&#8208;HD, a new sulfur&#8208;substituted dye platform exhibiting enhanced properties for photoacoustic probe development. To demonstrate generalizability, we employed PA&#8208;HD to access probes for beta&#8208;galactosidase and nitroreductase activities, as well as H2O2. Each probe was tested in live cells and in vivo. For instance, the H2O2 probe was employed to visualize oxidative stress in an Alzheimer's disease model.







Abstract
Most photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents are based on the repurposing of existing fluorescent dye platforms that exhibit non&#8208;optimal properties for PA applications. Herein, we introduce PA&#8208;HD, a new dye scaffold optimized for PA probe development that features a 4.8&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity and a red&#8208;shift of the &#955;abs from 690&#8197;nm to 745&#8197;nm to enable ratiometric imaging. Computational modeling was used to elucidate the origin of these enhanced properties. To demonstrate the generalizability of our remodeling efforts, we developed three probes for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal), nitroreductase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR), and H2O2 (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H2O2). We generated two cancer models to evaluate PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR. We employed a murine model of Alzheimer's disease to test PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H2O2. There, we observed a PA signal increase at 735&#8197;nm of 1.79&#177;0.20&#8208;fold relative to background, indicating the presence of oxidative stress. These results were confirmed via ratiometric calibration, which was not possible using the parent HD platform.

         <title>Development of Continuous Flow Systems to Access Secondary Amines Through Previously Incompatible Biocatalytic Cascades**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18660-18665, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of continuous flow reactors enabled previously inaccessible enzyme combinations in multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions. This included the combination of oxidases with aminating biocatalysts (transaminase/reductive aminase) and was extended to the continuous in situ biocatalytic generation of amino donors for the reductive aminase.







Abstract
A key aim of biocatalysis is to mimic the ability of eukaryotic cells to carry out multistep cascades in a controlled and selective way. As biocatalytic cascades get more complex, reactions become unattainable under typical batch conditions. Here a number of continuous flow systems were used to overcome batch incompatibility, thus allowing for successful biocatalytic cascades. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, reactive carbonyl intermediates were generated in situ using alcohol oxidases, then passed directly to a series of packed&#8208;bed modules containing different aminating biocatalysts which accordingly produced a range of structurally distinct amines. The method was expanded to employ a batch incompatible sequential amination cascade via an oxidase/transaminase/imine reductase sequence, introducing different amine reagents at each step without cross&#8208;reactivity. The combined approaches allowed for the biocatalytic synthesis of the natural product 4O&#8208;methylnorbelladine.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Decorated Amorphous/Crystalline RuO2 with Rich Oxygen Vacancies: A Robust pH&#8208;Universal Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18821-18829, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline RuO2 with rich oxygen vacancies was developed as a highly active pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. Its high acid corrosion and oxidation resistance under the OER conditions result in its extremely high acidic catalytic stability. Theoretical calculations reveal the formation of Na&#8208;doped and oxygen vacancy&#8208;containing structures is the key to increasing the OER activity of RuO2.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction for many electrochemical devices. To date, many OER electrocatalysts function well in alkaline media, but exhibit poor performances in neutral and acidic media, especially the acidic stability. Herein, sodium&#8208;decorated amorphous/crystalline RuO2 with rich oxygen vacancies (a/c&#8208;RuO2) was developed as a pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. The a/c&#8208;RuO2 shows remarkable resistance to acid corrosion and oxidation during OER, which leads to an extremely high catalytic stability, as confirmed by a negligible overpotential increase after continuously catalyzing OER for 60&#8197;h at pH=1. Besides, a/c&#8208;RuO2 also exhibits superior OER activities to commercial RuO2 and most reported OER catalysts under all pH conditions. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of Na dopant and oxygen vacancy in RuO2 weakens the adsorption strength of the OER intermediates by engineering the d&#8208;band center, thereby lowering the energy barrier for OER.

A functional and structural A&#946;42&#8208;oligomer equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin, shares major structural, functional, and biological properties with Alzheimer's wild&#8208;type A&#946;42 oligomers. Cryo&#8208;EM studies reveal that the &#945;HL&#8208;displayed oligomers structurally remain in a well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, providing a stable mimetic antigen for the development of conformation&#8208;specific antibodies.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;) oligomers are pathogenic species of amyloid aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. Like certain protein toxins, A&#946; oligomers permeabilize cellular membranes, presumably through a pore formation mechanism. Owing to their structural and stoichiometric heterogeneity, the structure of these pores remains to be characterized. We studied a functional A&#946;42&#8208;pore equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin. Our data reveal A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers to share major structural, functional, and biological properties with wild&#8208;type A&#946;42&#8208;pores. Single&#8208;particle cryo&#8208;EM analysis of A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers (with an overall 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution) reveals the A&#946;42&#8208;pore region to be intrinsically flexible. The A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers will allow many of the features of the wild&#8208;type amyloid oligomers to be studied that cannot be otherwise, and may be a highly specific antigen for the development of immuno&#8208;base diagnostics and therapies.

Radical C&#8722;H Deuteration: A environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for remote radical C&#8722;H deuteration at various unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds including primary C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms for the &#948;&#8208;deuteration of primary amines, &#947;&#8208;deuteration of aliphatic acids and &#945;&#8208;deuteration of secondary amines has been developed.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into biologically active compounds is of high interest in pharmaceutical industry. We present a mild and environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for the remote selective radical C&#8722;H monodeuteration of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in various amides with inexpensive heavy water (D2O) as the deuterium source. The method uses the easily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonyl moiety as an N&#8208;radical precursor that generates the remote C&#8208;radical via site&#8208;selective 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Methyl thioglycolate, that readily exchanges its proton with D2O, serves as the radical deuteration reagent and as a chain&#8208;carrier. The highly site&#8208;selective monodeuteration has been applied to different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds and also to the deuteration of C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms. The potential utility of this method is further demonstrated by the site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into natural product derivatives and drugs.

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems Based on AIEgen&#8208;branched Rotaxane Dendrimers for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18761-18768, August 16, 2021. </description>

A novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting system based on AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers has been successfully constructed which displayed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel platform for efficient light harvesting, the precise synthesis of a new family of AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers was successful realized from an AIEgen&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant AIE macromolecules, up to twenty&#8208;one AIEgens located at the tails of each branches, thus making them the first successful example of AIEgen&#8208;branched dendrimers. Attributed to the solvent&#8208;induced switching feature of the rotaxane branches, the integrated rotaxane dendrimers displayed interesting dynamic feature upon the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) process. Moreover, novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed based on these AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers, which revealed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction.

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Diarylation/Annulation of Benzoic Acids: Facile Access to Multi&#8208;Aryl Spirobifluorenes as Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>

Diarylation/annulation of benzoic acids is accomplished for the first time through an iridium catalyst system. This method streamlines access to a series of novel pure hydrocarbon hosts for phosphorescent OLEDs, which exhibit high external quantum efficiencies up to 27.3&#8201;%. This work not only shows the potential of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as hosts, but also offers a new synthetic strategy for these hosts.







Abstract
Herein disclosed is the first example of diarylation/annulation of benzoic acids via an iridium catalyst system. This protocol provides a step&#8208;economic and highly efficient pathway to 1&#8208;aryl, 1,3&#8208;diaryl, 1,7&#8208;diaryl and 1,3,7&#8208;triaryl spirobifluorenes from readily available starting materials. The applications of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as pure hydrocarbon (PHC) hosts for red, green, and blue (RGB) phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) were explored. Due to high triplet energies, 1,3&#8208;diaryl spirobifluorenes exhibit the potential as the host material of blue PhOLEDs. 1,7&#8208;Diaryl spirobifluorene can serve as the host of green PhOLEDs. 1,3,7&#8208;Triaryl spirobifluorene is a high&#8208;performance host for red PhOLEDs, which exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 27.3&#8201;%. This work not only exemplifies the great potential of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as PHC hosts, but also offers a new approach for the synthesis of these PHC hosts.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network Determines the Early Photoisomerization Processes of Cph1 and AnPixJ Phytochromes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18688-18693, August 16, 2021. </description>

QM/MM calculations reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond networks interacting with the PCB chromophore govern the distinct excited&#8208;state relaxations of red&#8208;light photoreceptors Cph1 and AnPixJ. The present results contribute to decipher the natural evolution of both cyanobacteriochromes and phytochromes.







Abstract
Phytochrome proteins are light receptors that play a pivotal role in regulating the life cycles of plants and microorganisms. Intriguingly, while cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and cyanobacteriochrome AnPixJ use the same phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore to absorb light, their excited&#8208;state behavior is very different. We employ multiscale calculations to rationalize the different early photoisomerization mechanisms of PCB in Cph1 and AnPixJ. We found that their electronic S1, T1, and S0 potential minima exhibit distinct geometric and electronic structures due to different hydrogen bond networks with the protein environment. These specific interactions influence the S1 electronic structures along the photoisomerization paths, ultimately leading to internal conversion in Cph1 but intersystem crossing in AnPixJ. This explains why the excited&#8208;state relaxation in AnPixJ is much slower (ca. 100&#8197;ns) than in Cph1 (ca. 30&#8197;ps). Further, we predict that efficient internal conversion in AnPixJ can be achieved upon protonating the carboxylic group that interacts with PCB.

         <title>Dynamic Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution of Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18783-18791, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
All the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry and the versatility of the tetrazine moiety have been combined in a novel exchange reaction: The nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) with phenols and alkyl thiols. Not only sophisticated structures could be easily synthesized, but more importantly, post&#8208;functionalization by IEDDA or photolysis of the compounds show that SNTz unleashes a huge potential of applications.







Abstract
A dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) is presented herein. It combines all the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry with the versatility of the tetrazine moiety. Indeed, libraries of compounds or sophisticated molecular structures can be easily obtained, which are susceptible to post&#8208;functionalization by inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which also locks the exchange. Additionally, the structures obtained can be disassembled upon the application of the right stimulus, either UV irradiation or a suitable chemical reagent. Moreover, SNTz is compatible with the imine chemistry of anilines. The high potential of this methodology has been proved by building two responsive supramolecular systems: A macrocycle that displays a light&#8208;induced release of acetylcholine; and a truncated [4+6] tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent fluorescent cage, which is disassembled by thiols unless it is post&#8208;stabilized by IEDDA.

A redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) system is presented. This system decouples the catalyst from the electrode, which gives the system huge versatility in catalyst design, loading and gas flow. By modifying the catalyst, either hydrazine or ammonium can be obtained selectively. The process has achieved ammonium production yield of 25.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 61&#8197;ppm ammonium can be accumulated by continuous operation.







Abstract
This work presents a redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) using polyoxometalate (POM) as the electron and proton carrier which frees the TiO2&#8208;based catalyst from the electrode and shifts the reduction of nitrogen to a reactor tank. The RM&#8208;eNRR process has achieved an ammonium production yield of 25.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 or 5.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an ammonium concentration of 6.7&#8197;ppm. With high catalyst loading, 61.0&#8197;ppm ammonium was accumulated in the electrolyte upon continuous operation, which is the highest concentration detected for ambient eNRR so far. The mechanism underlying the RM&#8208;eNRR was scrutinized both experimentally and computationally to delineate the POM&#8208;mediated charge transfer and hydrogenation process of nitrogen molecule on the catalyst. RM&#8208;eNRR is expected to provide an implementable solution to overcome the limitations in the conventional eNRR process.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Purely Covalent Cage with Homochirality by Imine Formation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18815-18820, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral, anionic tetrahedral cage was self&#8208;assembled in water by condensing an anionic trisbenzaldehyde and a trisamine in a [4+4] manner, enantioselectively, with the help of templating by a chiral guest. The tetrahedron is remarkably stable and can accommodate a variety of guest molecules when in water.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of host molecules in aqueous media via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is well developed. However, the preparation of purely covalent counterparts in water has remained a formidable task. An anionic tetrahedron cage was successfully self&#8208;assembled in a [4+4] manner by condensing a trisamine and a trisformyl in water. Even although each individual imine bond is rather labile and apt to hydrolyze in water, the tetrahedron is remarkably stable or inert due to multivalence. The tetrahedral cages, as well as its neutral counterparts dissolved in organic solvent, have homochirality, namely that their four propeller&#8208;shaped trisformyl residues adopt the same rotational conformation. The cage is able to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of guest molecules in water. When a chiral guest was recognized, the formation of one enantiomer of the cage became more favored relative to the other. As a consequence, the cage could be produced in an enantioselective manner. The tetrahedron is able to maintain its chirality after removal of the chiral guest&#8212;probably on account of the cooperative occurrence of intramolecular forces that restrict the intramolecular flipping of phenyl units in the cage framework.

A family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by actinobacteria and named gausemycins showed pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Gausemycins have a unique peptide core that includes 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb), chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), O&#8208;arabinosylated tyrosine, and N&#948;&#8208;acylated ornithine residues (see structure). Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences to known antibiotics.







Abstract
We report a novel family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by Streptomyces sp. INA&#8208;Ac&#8208;5812. Two major components of the mixture, named gausemycins&#8197;A and B, were isolated, and their structures were elucidated. The compounds are cyclic peptides with a unique peptide core and several remarkable structural features, including unusual positions of d&#8208;amino acids, lack of the Ca2+&#8208;binding Asp&#8208;X&#8208;Asp&#8208;Gly (DXDG) motif, tyrosine glycosylation with arabinose, presence of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb) and chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), and N&#8208;acylation of the ornithine side chain. Gausemycins have pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences compared to known glyco&#8208; and lipopeptides. Gausemycins exhibit only slight Ca2+&#8208;dependence of activity and induce no pore formation at low concentrations. Moreover, there is no detectable accumulation of cell wall biosynthesis precursors under treatment with gausemycins.

Ultrafast pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy detected by fluorescence is introduced. Combining sensitive fluorescence detection with ultrafast pulse&#8208;limited time resolution, this approach provides a complementary technique to standard transient absorption.







Abstract
We introduce a new approach to transient spectroscopy, fluorescence&#8208;detected pump&#8211;probe (F&#8208;PP) spectroscopy, that overcomes several limitations of traditional PP. F&#8208;PP suppresses excited&#8208;state absorption, provides background&#8208;free detection, removes artifacts resulting from pump&#8211;pulse scattering, from non&#8208;resonant solvent response, or from coherent pulse overlap, and allows unique extraction of excited&#8208;state dynamics under certain conditions. Despite incoherent detection, time resolution of F&#8208;PP is given by the duration of the laser pulses, independent of the fluorescence lifetime. We describe the working principle of F&#8208;PP and provide its theoretical description. Then we illustrate specific features of F&#8208;PP by direct comparison with PP, theoretically and experimentally. For this purpose, we investigate, with both techniques, a molecular squaraine heterodimer, core&#8211;shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, and fluorescent protein mCherry. F&#8208;PP is broadly applicable to chemical systems in various environments and in different spectral regimes.

         <title>Synthesis of Rhodium Complexes with Chiral Diene Ligands via Diastereoselective Coordination and Their Application in the Asymmetric Insertion of Diazo Compounds into E&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18712-18720, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium complexes with bulky racemic dienes were synthesized and separated into pure enantiomers by diastereoselective coordination with a chiral auxiliary ligand. The optimal structure of the auxiliary ligand and the selectivity of coordination were predicted by density functional theory calculations. The resulting chiral complexes catalyze the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A new method for the synthesis of chiral diene rhodium catalysts is introduced. The readily available racemic tetrafluorobenzobarrelene complexes [(R2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 were separated into two enantiomers via selective coordination of one of them with the auxiliary S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand. One of the resulting chiral complexes with an exceptionally bulky diene ligand [(R,R&#8208;iPr2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 was an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds giving the functionalized organoboranes and silanes with high yields (79&#8211;97&#8201;%) and enantiomeric purity (87&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). The stereoselectivity of separation via auxiliary ligand and that of the catalytic reaction was predicted by DFT calculations.

         <title>The Copper Chaperone NosL Forms a Heterometal Site for Cu Delivery to Nitrous Oxide Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18810-18814, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper metallochaperone NosL contains a heterobimetallic Zn,Cu site, where the redox&#8208;inert ZnII serves a structural role and prevents oxidation of the cysteine ligands. It also pre&#8208;forms the binding site for the cargo of the chaperone, a single CuI ion that is eventually transferred to the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase in the process of assembling its copper centres, CuA and CuZ.







Abstract
The final step of denitrification is the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2, mediated by Cu&#8208;dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR). Its metal centers, CuA and CuZ, are assembled through sequential provision of twelve CuI ions by a metallochaperone that forms part of a nos gene cluster encoding the enzyme and its accessory factors. The chaperone is the nosL gene product, an 18&#8197;kDa lipoprotein predicted to reside in the outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In order to better understand the assembly of N2OR, we have produced NosL from Shewanella denitrificans and determined the structure of the metal&#8208;loaded chaperone by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protein assembled a heterodinuclear metal site consisting of ZnII and CuI, as evidenced by anomalous X&#8208;ray scattering. While only CuI is delivered to the enzyme, the stabilizing presence of ZnII is essential for the functionality and structural integrity of the chaperone.

Light&#8208;induced molecular plumbing of cyclic peptide nanotubes based on a [4+4] cycloaddition of anthracene moieties is described. The geometrical changes induced by the formation of the cycloadduct transfer to the supramolecular aggregate structural constrains that force the nanotube to bend.







Abstract
Light&#8208;induced molecular piping of cyclic peptide nanotubes to form bent tubular structures is described. The process is based on the [4+4] photocycloaddition of anthracene moieties, whose structural changes derived from the interdigitated flat disposition of precursors to the corresponding cycloadduct moieties, induced the geometrical modifications in nanotubes packing that provokes their curvature. For this purpose, we designed a new class of cyclic peptide nanotubes formed by &#946;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The presence of the former predisposes the peptide to stack in a parallel fashion with the &#946;&#8208;residues aligned along the nanotube and the homogeneous distribution of anthracene pendants.

         <title>Ambient Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Alkenes Using a Nanostructured Ni&#8208;Core&#8211;Shell Catalyst</title>

Hydrogenation and deuteration of olefins made easy: A core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;nanocatalyst (Ni&#8201;NPs@C) allows the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of alkenes under ambient conditions (1&#8197;bar H2/D2, room temperature).







Abstract
A general protocol for the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of a variety of alkenes is presented. Key to success for these reactions is the use of a specific nickel&#8208;graphitic shell&#8208;based core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured catalyst, which is conveniently prepared by impregnation and subsequent calcination of nickel nitrate on carbon at 450&#8201;&#176;C under argon. Applying this nanostructured catalyst, both terminal and internal alkenes, which are of industrial and commercial importance, were selectively hydrogenated and deuterated at ambient conditions (room temperature, using 1&#8197;bar hydrogen or 1&#8197;bar deuterium), giving access to the corresponding alkanes and deuterium&#8208;labeled alkanes in good to excellent yields. The synthetic utility and practicability of this Ni&#8208;based hydrogenation protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale reactions as well as efficient catalyst recycling experiments.

         <title>Robust Pseudocapacitive Sodium Cation Intercalation Induced by Cobalt Vacancies at Atomically Thin Co1&#8722;xSe2/Graphene Heterostructure for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18830-18837, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co vacancies (VCo) at the interface of Co1&#8722;xSe2/graphene (GE) afford strong adsorption of Na+ and a low Na+ diffusion energy barrier to facilitate rapid intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ ions giving remarkable pseudocapacitance. The as&#8208;prepared Co1&#8722;xSe2/GE&#8208;based sodium ion batteries deliver high specific/rate capacity performance and exceptional cycling performance.







Abstract
Electronic structure engineering on electrode materials could bring in a new mechanism to achieve high energy and high power densities in sodium ion batteries. Herein, we design and create Co vacancies at the interface of atomically thin CoSe2/graphene heterostructure and obtain Co1&#8722;xSe2/graphene heterostructure electrode materials that facilitate significant Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the Na+ adsorption energy is dramatically increased, and the Na+ diffusion barrier is remarkably reduced due to the introduction of Co vacancy. The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C, excellent rate capability of 576.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8201;C and ultra&#8208;long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na+ storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies. This work suggests that the creation of cation vacancy could bestow heterostructured electrode materials with pseudocapacitive Na+ intercalation for high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate energy storage.

The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8201;C, excellent rate capability of 576.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0&#8201;C and ultra-long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies. This work suggests that the creation of cation vacancy could bestow heterostructured electrode materials with pseudocapacitive Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation for high-capacity and high-rate energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photoreaction occurs under mild conditions mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals. The potential of the method is documented by the successful coupling of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids and by the conjugation of polymers.







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photo click reaction occurs under mild conditions (415&#8197;nm) mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals via light mediated siloxycarbene generation with subsequent indole&#8208;N&#8208;H insertion. We show that this very efficient and fully atom economic coupling process can be applied to conjugate complex systems, as documented by the clicking of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids. The method is also applicable to the conjugation of polymer chains. The linking acetal moiety can be readily cleaved and it is also shown that wavelength&#8208;selective coupling and cleavage with acyl silanes bearing a second photoactive moiety is possible. This is documented by a successful polymerization/depolymerization sequence and by a polymer folding/unfolding process.

         <title>Selective 13C&#8208;Labels on Repeating Glycan Oligomers to Reveal Protein Binding Epitopes through NMR: Polylactosamine Binding to Galectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18777-18782, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Repeating carbohydrate patterns are commonly found in Nature in extended oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. When recognized by protein receptors, dissecting the contribution of each repeating unit to the binding event is not easy. Here, the introduction of 13C&#8208;labels at specific positions of a tri&#8208;LacNAc repeating hexasaccharide has been used in STD&#8208;HSQC&#8197;NMR experiments to reveal the preferred binding epitopes for a panel of human galectins.







Abstract
A combined chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis/NMR&#8208;based methodology is presented to identify, in unambiguous manner, the distinctive binding epitope within repeating sugar oligomers when binding to protein receptors. The concept is based on the incorporation of 13C&#8208;labels at specific monosaccharide units, selected within a repeating glycan oligomeric structure. No new chemical tags are added, and thus the chemical entity remains the same, while the presence of the 13C&#8208;labeled monosaccharide breaks the NMR chemical shift degeneracy that occurs in the non&#8208;labeled compound and allows the unique identification of the different components of the oligomer. The approach is demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study dealing with the interaction of a polylactosamine hexasaccharide with five different galectins that display distinct preferences for these entities.

         <title>Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18728-18733, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aminocatalytic oxidative umpolung strategy for asymmetric etherification of the &#945;&#8208;position of branched aldehydes is presented. The protocol avoids pre&#8208;functionalization and employs commercially available oxygen nucleophiles. Polarity inversion proceeds via an aminocatalytic SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution of in situ generated racemic quinone adducts.







Abstract
Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogues, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;&#8208;position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;&#8208;position of racemic &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified p&#8208;fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners. p&#8208;Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91&#8201;% ee, following either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95&#8201;% ee. Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports a mechanism proceeding via an SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution. These studies provide the basis for an aminocatalytic umpolung concept that allows for the asymmetric construction of tertiary ethers in the &#945;&#8208;position of aldehydes.

         <title>Multienzyme One&#8208;Pot Cascades Incorporating Methyltransferases for the Strategic Diversification of Tetrahydroisoquinoline Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18673-18679, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions were developed leading to the scalable synthesis of methylated tetra&#8208;hydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The reactions occurred in one&#8208;pot starting from simple building blocks such as dopamine or L&#8208;tyrosine. The use of selected methyltransferases enabled regioselective methylations. When more than one catechol moiety was present, methylations could be directed towards one or more hydroxyl group.







Abstract
The tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) ring system is present in a large variety of structurally diverse natural products exhibiting a wide range of biological activities. Routes to mimic the biosynthetic pathways to such alkaloids, by building cascade reactions in vitro, represents a successful strategy and can offer better stereoselectivities than traditional synthetic methods. S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases are crucial in the biosynthesis and diversification of THIQs; however, their application is often limited in vitro by the high cost of SAM and low substrate scope. In this study, we describe the use of methyltransferases in vitro in multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, including for the generation of SAM in situ. Up to seven enzymes were used for the regioselective diversification of natural and non&#8208;natural THIQs on an enzymatic preparative scale. Regioselectivites of the methyltransferases were dependent on the group at C&#8208;1 and presence of fluorine in the THIQs. An interesting dual activity was also discovered for the catechol methyltransferases used, which were found to be able to regioselectively methylate two different catechols in a single molecule.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18769-18776, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive storage of cations and anions was achieved by redox of only ligands, enabling robust sodium&#8208;ion batteries that show a much higher cyclability than in cases of storage of only cations by redox reactions of both ligands and metal ions.

The oxidation of &#960;&#8211;d&#8208;conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) accompanied with anion insertion has the merits of increasing the capacity and elevating the discharge voltages. However, previous reports on this mechanism either required more investigations or showed low capacity and poor cyclablity. Herein, triphenylene&#8208;catecholate&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional CCPs are constructed by employing inactive transition&#8208;metal ions (Zn2+) as nodes, forming Zn&#8208;HHTP. Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate the successive storage of cations and anions by redox reactions of only ligands, leading to a high reversible capacity of &#8776;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 90&#8201;% after 1000 cycles. On the contrary, as a control experiment, the analogous CCPs (Cu&#8208;HHTP) with Cu2+ nodes, where both ligands and metal ions undergo redox reactions, accompanied by the storage of only Na+ cations, show a much poorer cyclability. These results highlight the importance of redox reactions of only ligands for long&#8208;term cycle life and the insight into the storage mechanisms deepens our understanding on CCPs for the further design of CCPs with high performance.

         <title>An Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskitoid with Zwitterion Cysteamine Linker and its Crystal&#8211;Crystal Transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18750-18760, August 16, 2021. </description>

A unique organic&#8211;inorganic single&#8208;crystal perovskitoid structure (yellow) is synthesized by using zwitterionic cysteamine linkers. It gradually transforms into a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper structure (red crystallites) via a crystal&#8211;crystal transformation. The perovskitoid can be used as an active layer in self&#8208;powered photodetector and as a selective Ni2+ ion detection probe.







Abstract
We demonstrate synthesis of a new low&#8208;D hybrid perovskitoid (a perovskite&#8208;like hybrid halide structure, yellow crystals, P21/n space group) using zwitterion cysteamine (2&#8208;aminoethanethiol) linker, and its remarkable molecular diffusion&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase (Red crystals, Pnma space group). Our stable intermediate perovskitoid distinctly differs from all previous reports by way of a unique staggered arrangement of holes in the puckered 2D configuration with a face&#8208;sharing connection between the corrugated&#8208;1D double chains. The PL intensity for the yellow phase is 5 orders higher as compared to the red phase and the corresponding average lifetime is also fairly long (143&#8197;ns). First principles DFT calculations conform very well with the experimental band gap data. We demonstrate applicability of the new perovskitoid yellow phase as an excellent active layer in a self&#8208;powered photodetector and for selective detection of Ni2+ via On&#8208;Off&#8208;On photoluminescence (PL) based on its composite with few&#8208;layer black phosphorous.

         <title>RuV&#8208;Acylimido Intermediate in [RuIV(Por)Cl2]&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;N Bond Formation: Spectroscopic Characterization, Reactivity, and Catalytic Reactions</title>

Experimental studies including ESI&#8208;MS, EPR spectroscopy and KIE, and also DFT calculations point to the intermediacy of a porphyrin&#8208;supported RuV(NCOR) species in [RuIV(Por)Cl2]&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation reactions with acyl azides N3COR (up to 99&#8201;% yield). The [RuIV(Por)Cl2]/N3COR catalytic method is applicable to various substrates, including alkenes, indoles, silyl enol ethers, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation reactions via acylnitrene transfer have recently attracted much attention, but direct detection of the proposed acylnitrenoid/acylimido M(NCOR) (R=aryl or alkyl) species in these reactions poses a formidable challenge. Herein, we report on Ru(NCOR) intermediates in C&#8722;N bond formation catalyzed by [RuIV(Por)Cl2]/N3COR, a catalytic method applicable to aziridine/oxazoline formation from alkenes, amination of substituted indoles, &#945;&#8208;amino ketone formation from silyl enol ethers, amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and functionalization of natural products and carbohydrate derivatives (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Experimental studies, including HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EPR measurements, coupled with DFT calculations, lend evidence for the formulation of the Ru(NCOR) acylnitrenoids as a RuV&#8208;imido species.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers with Dual Active Sites for Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction in Alkaline Medium</title>

         <dc:description>
The incorporation of water dissociation active sites in conjugated acetylenic polymers leads to highly efficient dual active site photocathodes. In poly&#8208; (diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) on Cu foam, the photoactivated C&#946;(H) split the water molecule, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; are responsible for the hydrogen evolution, reaching a benchmark photocurrent density of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE at pH&#8197;13.







Abstract
Although being attractive materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER) under neutral or acidic conditions, conjugated polymers still show poor PEC HER performance in alkaline medium due to the lack of water dissociation sites. Herein, we demonstrate that tailoring the polymer skeleton from poly(diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET) to poly(2,6&#8208;diethynylbenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (pBDT) and poly(diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) (pDTT) in conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) introduces highly efficient active sites for water dissociation. As a result, pDTT and pBDT, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 120&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE; pH&#8197;13), which are 4.2 and 3&#8197;times higher than that of pDET, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron&#8208;enriched C&#946; of the outer thiophene rings of pDTT are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Enzyme Mimic Facilitated Artificial Cell to Mammalian Cell Signal Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18704-18711, August 16, 2021. </description>

Signal transfer from artificial cells to mammalian cells facilitated by artificial enzymes was demonstrated. Two metalloporphyrins were used to mimic the catalytic behavior of enzymes from the cytochrome P450 family. Hydrogel&#8208;based artificial cells containing these artificial enzymes were able to produce two fluorescent signaling molecules that could diffuse to mammalian HepG2 cells and led to distinguishable intracellular fluorescence.







Abstract
Catalyzing biochemical reactions with enzymes and communicating with neighboring cells via chemical signaling are two fundamental cellular features that play a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of organisms. Herein, we present an artificial enzyme (AE) facilitated signal transfer between artificial cells (ACs) and mammalian HepG2 cells. We synthesize metalloporphyrins (MPs) based AEs that mimic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) to catalyze a dealkylation and a hydroxylation reaction, exemplified by the conversion of resorufin ethyl ether (REE) to resorufin and coumarin (COU) to 7&#8208;hydroxycoumarin (7&#8208;HC), respectively. The AEs are immobilized in hydrogels to produce ACs that generate the two diffusive fluorophores, which can diffuse into HepG2 cells and result in dual intracellular emissions. This work highlights the use of AEs to promote AC to mammalian signal transfer, which opens up new opportunities for integrating the synthetic and living world with a bottom&#8208;up strategy.

Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8722;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.







Abstract
We present herein an unprecedented diastereoconvergent synthesis of vicinal diamines from diols through an economical, redox&#8208;neutral process. Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8722;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, the first enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.

         <title>Stability and Optical Absorption of a Comprehensive Virtual Library of Minimal Eumelanin Oligomer Models**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18800-18809, August 16, 2021. </description>

To understand the details of eumelanin structure and relate the stability of its components with optical properties, we have studied a library of 830 minimal models of eumelanin components, dimers of 5,6&#8208;dihydroxy indole (DHI), with density functional theory. Our library considers all possible chemical diversity. The most stable dimers have polycyclic, oxidized structures and absorb as low as 1.3&#8197;eV (&#955;&gt;900&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Eumelanin is responsible for photoprotection in living organisms. It is made of 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole (DHI) oligomers. However, lack of detailed structural knowledge limits understanding its function and exploiting its potential in material science. To uncover the relationship between structural stability and optical properties, we have studied a virtual library of 830 DHI dimers. We find a preference for oxidized, polycyclic structures which speaks in favor of graphite&#8208;like structures for the larger oligomers, and propose an electrocyclic formation mechanism. Besides widely considered quinone oxidation patterns, also structures with interfragment double bonds and zwitterionic resonance structures are stable. Future theoretical melanine models will have to cover this diversity, and we introduce a new representative set of 49 stable dimers. Some stable oxidized dimers have absorption energies as low as 1.3&#8197;eV. They may be present as substructures in the naturally found oligomers and contribute to the absorption spectrum of the biopolymer.

         <title>Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries enabled by Zincophilic&#8211;Zincophobic Interfacial Layers and Interrupted Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18845-18851, August 16, 2021. </description>

A highly reversible Zn anode working at low temperature is achieved by introducing SnCl2 into eutectic ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte to form a zincophilic&#8211;zincophobic interfacial layer on the Zn anode in&#8197;situ. The bottom layer of Sn facilitates uniform Zn deposition, while the top layer of zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2 H2O facilitates Zn2+ diffusion and avoids Zn dendrites. The eutectic composition enhances the low temperature conductivity.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries promise high energy density but suffer from Zn dendritic growth and poor low&#8208;temperature performance. Here, we overcome both challenges by using an eutectic 7.6&#8197;m ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte with 0.05&#8197;m SnCl2 additive, which in situ forms a zincophilic/zincophobic Sn/Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O bilayer interphase and enables low temperature operation. Zincophilic Sn decreases Zn plating/stripping overpotential and promotes uniform Zn plating, while zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O top&#8208;layer suppresses Zn dendrite growth. The eutectic electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity of &#8776;0.8&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C due to the distortion of hydrogen bond network by solvated Zn2+ and Cl&#8722;. The eutectic electrolyte enables Zn&#8741;Ti half&#8208;cell a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of &gt;99.7&#8201;% for 200 cycles and Zn&#8741;Zn cell steady charge/discharge for 500&#8197;h with a low overpotential of 8&#8197;mV at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Practically, Zn&#8741;VOPO4 batteries maintain &gt;95&#8201;% capacity with a CE of &gt;99.9&#8201;% for 200 cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C, and retain &#8776;30&#8201;% capacity at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C of that at 20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Dry Reforming of CH4/CO2 by Stable Ni Nanocrystals on Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline MgO Monoliths at Reduced Temperature</title>

Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles on porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths to enhance dry reforming of CH4/CO2 and present the quantitative syngas production with excellent durability after continuous operation of 500 hours at 650&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides a promising and economically feasible route for the large&#8208;scale carbon fixation; however, the coking and sintering of catalysts remain a fundamental challenge. Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles at the surface of porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths and show the quantitative production of syngas from dry reforming of CH4/CO2. We show the complete conversion of CH4/CO2 even only at 700&#8201;&#176;C with excellent performance durability after a continuous operation of 500&#8197;hours. The well&#8208;defined and catalytically active Ni&#8208;MgO interfaces facilitate the reforming reaction and enhance the coking resistance.

&lt;p&gt;Here we stabilize single-crystalline Ni nanoparticles on porous single-crystalline MgO monoliths to enhance dry reforming of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and present the quantitative syngas production with excellent durability after continuous operation of 500 hours at 650&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry reforming of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provides a promising and economically feasible route for the large-scale carbon fixation; however, the coking and sintering of catalysts remain a fundamental challenge. Here we stabilize single-crystalline Ni nanoparticles at the surface of porous single-crystalline MgO monoliths and show the quantitative production of syngas from dry reforming of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We show the complete conversion of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; even only at 700&#8201;&#176;C with excellent performance durability after a continuous operation of 500&#8197;hours. The well-defined and catalytically active Ni-MgO interfaces facilitate the reforming reaction and enhance the coking resistance. Our findings would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the &#8220;Nanocrystal On Porous Single-crystalline Monoliths&#8221; technique could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Macrodiolide Diversification Reveals Broad Immunosuppressive Activity That Impairs the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18734-18741, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and flexible synthesis of macrodiolides related to the natural product vermiculine is described. A common building block prepared through a catalytic asymmetric route enabled various modifications to the scaffold and stereochemical flexibility. Partial blocking of the keto&#8208;enoate groups afforded the analogue LH519 (see structure), which exhibited broad inhibition of innate immune signaling pathways, including cGAS&#8208;STING, with minimal effects on cell viability.







Abstract
The development of new immunomodulatory agents can impact various areas of medicine. In particular, compounds with the ability to modulate innate immunological pathways hold significant unexplored potential. Herein, we report a modular synthetic approach to the macrodiolide natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;vermiculine, an agent previously shown to possess diverse biological effects, including cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity. The synthesis allows for a high degree of flexibility in modifying the macrocyclic framework, including the formation of all possible stereoisomers. In total, 18 analogues were prepared. Two analogues with minor structural modifications showed clearly enhanced cancer cell line selectivity and reduced toxicity. Moreover, these compounds possessed broad inhibitory activity against innate immunological pathways in human PBMCs, including the DNA&#8208;sensing cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Initial mechanistic characterization suggests a surprising impairment of the STING&#8208;TBK1 interaction.

         <title>Sydnone Methides&#8212;A Forgotten Class of Mesoionic Compounds for the Generation of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18882-18887, August 16, 2021. </description>

Except for a single example, sydnone methides have been unknown to date. Syntheses are described here, leading to 10 stable and intensely colorful, slightly fluorescent sydnone methides with Z=CN, COOMe, and SO2Me, respectively. On deprotonation, unique anionic &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are formed which react to thioethers and selenoethers, mercury, gold and rhodium complexes, and 4&#8208;acylsydnone methide on treatment with acyl chlorides.







Abstract
Sydnone methides are described from which only one single example has been mentioned in the literature so far. Their deprotonation gave anions which can be formulated as &#960;&#8208;electron rich anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Sulfur and selenium adducts were stabilized as their methyl ethers, and mercury, gold as well as rhodium complexes of the sydnone methide carbenes were prepared. Sydnone methide anions also undergo C&#8722;C coupling reactions with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;iodobenzene under Pd(PPh3)4 and CuBr catalysis. 77Se&#8197;NMR resonance frequencies and 1JC4&#8208;Se as well as 1JC4&#8208;H coupling constants have been determined to gain knowledge about the electronic properties of the anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. The carbene carbon atom of the sydnone methide anion 3&#8201;j resonates at &#948;=155.2&#8197;ppm in 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C which is extremely shifted upfield in comparison to classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes.

         <title>Consecutive Ligand&#8208;Based Electron Transfer in New Molecular Copper&#8208;Based Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A family of Cu&#8208;based complexes bearing dianionic bpy&#8208;amidate ligands have been prepared and characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. The new complexes are capable of performing water oxidation catalysis at overpotentials between 557&#8211;830&#8197;mV pH&#8197;11.6. A detailed electrocatalytic study in combination with computational calculations revealed the all ligand&#8208;based nature of the electron transfer processes involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Water oxidation to dioxygen is one of the key reactions that need to be mastered for the design of practical devices based on water splitting with sunlight. In this context, water oxidation catalysts based on first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are highly desirable due to their low cost and their synthetic versatility and tunability through rational ligand design. A new family of dianionic bpy&#8208;amidate ligands of general formula H2LNn&#8722; (LN is [2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxamide) substituted with phenyl or naphthyl redox non&#8208;innocent moieties is described. A detailed electrochemical analysis of [(L4)Cu]2&#8722; (L4=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarbonyl)bis(azanediyl))dibenzenesulfonate) at pH&#8197;11.6 shows the presence of a large electrocatalytic wave for water oxidation catalysis at an &#951;=830&#8197;mV. Combined experimental and computational evidence, support an all ligand&#8208;based process with redox events taking place at the aryl&#8208;amide groups and at the hydroxido ligands.

         <title>Mechanochemical Reactivity of Bottlebrush and Dendronized Polymers: Solid vs. Solution States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18651-18659, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers with ultrasonication (solution state) and ball&#8208;mill grinding (solid state) was explored. This study provides important insight into the influence of polymer architecture on mechanochemical reactions and the difference in reactivity that is observed in solution and solid states, which has important implications in the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.







Abstract
We explored the mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers in solution (with ultrasonication, US) and solid states (with ball&#8208;mill grinding, BMG). Over 50 polymers were prepared with varying backbone length and arm architecture, composition, and size. With US, we found that bottlebrush and dendronized polymers exhibited consistent backbone scission behavior, which was related to their elongated conformations in solution. Considerably different behavior was observed with BMG, as arm architecture and composition had a significant impact on backbone scission rates. Arm scission was also observed for bottlebrush polymers in both solution and solid states, but only in the solid state for dendronized polymers. Motivated by these results, multi&#8208;mechanophore polymers with bottlebrush and dendronized polymer architectures were prepared and their reactivity was compared. Although dendronized polymers showed slower arm&#8208;scission, the selectivity for mechanophore activation was much higher. Overall, these results have important implications to the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Modified Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films for Polarity&#8208;Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>

Surface&#8208;modification of phthalocyanine&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) films by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains is developed for achieving high&#8208;performance polarity&#8208;selective chemiresistive sensing toward humidity and polar alcohols.







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as electroactive materials for chemiresistive sensors, but selective sensing with fast response/recovery is a challenge. Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Ni2[MPc(NH)8] 2D c&#8208;MOF films are presented as active layers for polarity&#8208;selective chemiresisitors toward water and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Surface&#8208;hydrophobic modification by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains on 2D c&#8208;MOF films decreases diffused analytes into the MOF backbone, resulting in a considerably accelerated recovery progress (from ca. 50 to ca. 10&#8197;s) during humidity sensing. Toward VOCs, the sensors deliver a polarity&#8208;selective response among alcohols but no signal for low&#8208;polarity aprotic hydrocarbons. The octadecyltrimethoxysilane&#8208;modified Ni2[MPc(NH)8] based sensor displays high&#8208;performance methanol sensing with fast response (36&#8197;s)/recovery (13&#8197;s) and a detection limit as low as 10&#8197;ppm, surpassing reported room&#8208;temperature chemiresistors.

Compartmentalised flow reactors allow biocatalytic cascades that would be impossible using standard methods, as described by Sebastian&#8197;C. Cosgrove, Sabine&#8197;L. Flitsch, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;18660. Carbonyl intermediates were continuously generated via biocatalytic oxidation, then converted into different amine products using immobilised aminating enzymes. The use of flow equipment allowed exquisite control of the paths and enabled a range of new biocatalytic cascades to be constructed, paving the way for fully automated continuous biocatalytic cascades.

String&#8208;like stacks of metal ions, like tennis balls in their box, are a sought&#8208;after architecture because of the properties that may result from short distances between multiple metal centers. Ivan Huc et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication on page&#8197;18461 how helical aromatic foldamers enable the production of such structures and can be loaded with copper(II) centers with barely any change in their conformation, producing objects reminiscent of a wire in an organic sheath.

         <title>Hematite Photoanodes for Water Oxidation: Electronic Transitions, Carrier Dynamics, and Surface Energetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18380-18396, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current understanding of hematite photoanodes is comprehensively discussed. In light of guidelines for photoanode design, we focus on charge carriers, their origin, early&#8208;stage dynamics, surface dynamics and their competitive interfacial transfer through the valence band edge, surface states, and cocatalysts.







Abstract
We review the current understanding of charge carriers in model hematite photoanodes at different stages. The origin of charge carriers is discussed based on the electronic structure and absorption features, highlighting the controversial assignment of the electronic transitions near the absorption edge. Next, the dynamic evolution of charge carriers is analyzed both on the ultrafast and on the surface reaction timescales, with special emphasis on the arguable spectroscopic assignment of electrons/holes and their kinetics. Further, the competitive charge transfer centers at the solid&#8211;liquid interface are reviewed, and the chemical nature of relevant surface states is updated. Finally, an overview on the function of widely employed surface cocatalysts is given to illustrate the complex influence of physiochemical modifications on the charge carrier dynamics. The understanding of charge carriers from their origin all the way to their interfacial transfer is vital for the future of photoanode design.

New chemistry from single cells: The challenge of studying uncultivated microbes is a significant impediment to efforts to mine the natural world for useful molecules. Single&#8208;cell analysis techniques have achieved significant success in the study of microbial ecology but are only beginning to gain traction in the search for microbial natural products. This review highlights successful implementations and promising techniques for future studies.







Abstract
The diverse microbes that produce natural products represent an important source of novel therapeutics, drug leads, and scientific tools. However, the vast majority have not been grown in axenic culture and are members of complex communities. While meta&#8208;&#8217;omic methods such as metagenomics, &#8208;transcriptomics, and &#8208;proteomics reveal collective molecular features of this &#8220;microbial dark matter&#8221;, the study of individual microbiome members can be challenging. To address these limits, a number of techniques with single&#8208;bacterial resolution have been developed in the last decade and a half. While several of these are embraced by microbial ecologists, there has been less use by researchers interested in mining microbes for natural products. In this review, we discuss the available and emerging techniques for targeted single&#8208;cell analysis with a particular focus on applications to the discovery and study of natural products.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Making Strong Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18397-18410, August 16, 2021. </description>

The advantages and drawbacks of strategies that generate strong graphene materials by eliminating the voids between the graphene platelets and the wrinkling of the graphene platelets are discussed in this Minireview. The fundamental mechanical properties and the wide&#8208;ranging electrical and magnetic properties of the resulting materials are also discussed.







Abstract
Graphene materials have been widely applied in various fields because of their remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, two obstacles arise during the assembly of graphene platelets into macroscale graphene materials and composites that impair the performance of the resultant graphene materials: 1)&#8197;the voids between the graphene platelets, and 2)&#8197;the wrinkling of the graphene platelets. In the past decade, several strategies have been developed to eliminate these obstacles. These strategies result in strong macroscale graphene materials, such as graphene fibers with tensile strengths of over 3.4&#8197;GPa and sheets with tensile strengths of over 1.5&#8197;GPa, which have many practical applications. This Minireview summarizes the effective strategies for assembling graphene materials and compares their advantages and drawbacks. The preparation processes as well as the resulting fundamental mechanical properties and wide spectrum of electrical and magnetic properties are also discussed. Finally, our outlook for the future of this field is presented.

Very stable helices of oligoamides take up CuII ions in their cavity through deprotonation with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of up to 16 CuII centers, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath.







Abstract
The very stable helices of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid oligoamides are shown to uptake CuII ions in their cavity through deprotonation of their amide functions with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of a defined number of CuII centers (up to sixteen in this study) at a 3&#8197;&#197; distance, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath. The helices pack in the solid state so that the arrays of CuII extend intermolecularly. Conductive&#8208;AFM and cyclic voltammetry suggest that electrons are transported throughout the metal&#8208;loaded helices in contrast with hole transport observed for analogous foldamers devoid of metal ions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Amidation of Light Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18467-18471, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenative amidation of light alkanes C1&#8211;C4 has been accomplished using copper catalysis. This strategy has allowed establishing the relative reactivity of the C&#8722;H bonds of gaseous alkanes, which correlates with bond dissociation energy values.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in light alkanes, particularly to form C&#8722;N bonds, remains a challenge. We report the dehydrogenative coupling of amides with C1&#8211;C4 hydrocarbons to form N&#8208;alkyl amide products with tBuOOtBu as oxidant, and a copper complex of a phenanthroline&#8208;type ligand as catalyst. The reactions occurred in good yields in benzene or supercritical carbon dioxide as solvents. This strategy allowed for the determination of the relative reactivity of these alkane C&#8722;H bonds toward this amination process and showed, in contrast to prior work with larger alkanes, that the reactivity correlated with bond dissociation energies.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Embedded Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Redox Chemistry of Cyclothianthrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18443-18447, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, [n]cyclothianthrenes, were successfully constructed and characterized. The reported synthetic strategy allows access to not only the smallest and most strained cyclothianthrene, but also unprecedented chiral belts including a M&#246;bius strip. Further studies reveal these belt&#8208;like molecules are redox&#8208;active and potential materials for host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclothianthrenes, a series of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts proposed a decade ago, were successfully constructed through a stepwise bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The belt [6]cyclothianthrene ([6]CT) is the smallest and most strained member of the family yet reported. Both [6]CT and [8]CT are the first examples of cyclothianthrene characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. An unprecedented chiral belt [7]CT and a M&#246;bius&#8208;shaped [9]CT were also achieved via modular synthesis. Crystallographic and computational studies show that belts [6]CT&#8208;[8]CT have prism&#8208;like conformations with well&#8208;defined tubular cavities which have potential for guest molecule inclusion. Cyclic voltammograms further revealed that these belts are redox&#8208;active. The success of constructing sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, that is, cyclothianthrenes, greatly enriches the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped molecular belts and tubes.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Organic Fluid Phosphorescence Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18557-18560, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and effective strategy for the preparation of pure organic fluid materials with effective room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission was proposed. The material was observed to have moderate phosphorescent emission even at 85&#8201;&#176;C, based on which a temperature detection strategy was developed.







Abstract
It is an accepted approach to construct room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials by suppressing the non&#8208;radiative decay process. However, there is limited success in developing fluid phosphorescence materials owing to the ultrafast non&#8208;radiation relaxation of vibration and collision of molecules in fluid matrixes. Here, a universal deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent strategy is proposed for developing pure organic phosphorescent fluid materials that are able to generate effective phosphorescent emissions at both room temperature (&#934;RTP,293&#8201;K&#8776;30&#8201;%) and even higher temperature (&#934;RTP,358&#8201;K&#8776;4.53&#8201;%). Based on these findings, a qualitative analytical method was developed for leak detection and a quantitative analytical technique was further validated to help visually identify the heat distribution of irregular surfaces. This advancement empowers the current organic phosphorescent system offering an alternative to determine moisture and heat from non&#8208;invasive photoluminescence emission colors.

         <title>Five Step Total Synthesis of Lythranidine</title>

Design and implementation of a symmetry&#8208;focused, two&#8208;directional strategy leads to an extraordinarily short synthesis of the macrocyclic metacyclophane natural product lythranidine and most of its diastereomers.







Abstract
A concise synthesis of the alkaloid lythranidine is reported. The strategy exploits the target's local C2 symmetry by adopting a two directional synthetic approach, first in an acyclic environment, then in a cyclic system and finally in a bridged macrocyclic domain. The latter phase of the synthesis, which installs all four stereocenters, involves a thermodynamically controlled, twofold intermolecular/transannular aza&#8208;Michael addition and a twofold hydride reduction. The synthesis is one third of the length of the most step&#8208;economic previous approach, providing access to gram quantities of the natural product. The broad&#8208;spectrum nature of the synthesis is demonstrated through the preparation of three diastereomeric analogues of the natural product.

We fabricated a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles, a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal ultrastrong coupling conditions and applied the photoanode to a water oxidation reaction. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% of maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency, obtained at 580&#8197;nm. These results derive from the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency owing to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement.







Abstract
We developed a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles (NPs), a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal strong coupling conditions with a large splitting energy of 520&#8197;meV, which can be categorized into the ultrastrong coupling regime. We fabricated a photoanode under ultrastrong coupling conditions to verify the relationship between the coupling strength and photoelectric conversion efficiency and successfully performed efficient photochemical reactions. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE), obtained at 580&#8197;nm, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was 4.1&#8201;%. These results were attributed to the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency due to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement and relatively negative potential distribution of the hot electrons. Furthermore, hybrid mode&#8208;induced water oxidation using AATA structures was performed, with a Faraday efficiency of more than 70&#8201;% for O2 evolution.

         <title>Cycloisomerization of Carbamoyl Chlorides in Hexafluoroisopropanol: Stereoselective Synthesis of Chlorinated Methylene Oxindoles and Quinolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18478-18483, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a reagent in the cycloisomerization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides is demonstrated. The chlorinated methylene oxindole products are obtained in excellent E&#8208;selectivities. This reactivity was also extended towards the synthesis of chlorinated methylene pyrrolidones and 2&#8208;quinolinones.







Abstract
Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was employed as an additive for the generation of 3&#8208;(chloromethylene)oxindoles via the chloroacylation of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides. This reaction avoids the use of a metal catalyst and accesses products in high yields and stereoselectivities. Additionally, this reaction is scalable and proved amenable to a series of product derivatizations, including the synthesis of nintedanib. The reactivity of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was harnessed towards the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones.

         <title>Dissecting the Flash Chemistry of Electrogenerated Reactive Intermediates by Microdroplet Fusion Mass Spectrometry</title>

Microreactor on the fly: A special microreactor that permits mass spectrometric probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was demonstrated based on collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets, which employed a theta&#8208;glass capillary integrated with carbon bipolar electrodes to produce short&#8208;lived intermediates in situ.







Abstract
A novel mass spectrometric method for probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was developed based on rapid collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets by using a theta&#8208;glass capillary. The two individual microchannels of the theta&#8208;glass capillary are asymmetrically or symmetrically fabricated with a carbon bipolar electrode to produce intermediates in situ. Microdroplets containing the newly formed intermediates collide with those of the invoked reactants at sub&#8208;10 microsecond level, making it a powerful tool for exploring their ultrafast initial transformations. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the identification of the key radical cation intermediate in the oxidative dimerization of 8&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and also the first disclosure of previously hidden nitrenium ion involved reaction pathway in the C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling between N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylaniline and phenothiazine.

         <title>Palladium/TY&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intermolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Aldehydes with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18542-18546, August 16, 2021. </description>

Asymmetric intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl disubstituted aldehydes with aryl bromides provides a rapid access to chiral aldehydes bearing an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in moderate to good yields with 50:50&#8211;97:3 er. Enantiomers were obtained efficiently with the same ligand by changing the functional groups of aryl bromides with aldehydes.







Abstract
Despite much progress has been made in the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation reactions of cyclic ketones, lactones and lactams, the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic carbonyl compounds lagged much behind due to the in situ generated Z/E&#8208;enolate intermediates leading to opposite enantiomers. Especially, the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic aldehydes is a long&#8208;standing challenge, because of the highest activity among carbonyl compounds leading to various competitive side reactions. Herein we reported an efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl disubstituted aldehydes with aryl bromides, which provides a rapid access to chiral aldehydes bearing an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in moderate to good yields with good er in most cases. In addition, a pair of enantiomers could be easily prepared with the use of the same ligand by exchanging the aryl groups of aldehyde and aryl bromide.

         <title>Transfer, Amplification, Storage, and Complete Self&#8208;Recovery of Supramolecular Chirality in an Achiral Polymer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18566-18571, August 16, 2021. </description>

The storage and complete self&#8208;recovery of supramolecular chirality in an absolute achiral azobenzene&#8208;containing polymer system is successfully achieved for the first time.







Abstract
Supramolecular chirality and its complete self&#8208;recovery ability are highly mystical in nature and biological systems, which remains a major challenge today. Herein, we demonstrate that partially cross&#8208;linked azobenzene (Azo) units can be employed as the potential chiral trigger to fully heal the destroyed helical superstructure in achiral nematic polymer system. Combining the self&#8208;assembly of Azo units and terminal hydroxyl groups in polymer side chains allows the vapor&#8208;induced chiral nematic phase and covalent fixation of the superstructure via acetal reaction. The induced helical structure of Azo units can be stored by inter&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking, even after removal of the chiral source. Most interestingly, the stored chiral information can trigger perfect chiral self&#8208;recovery (CSR) behavior after being destroyed by UV light, heat, and solvents. The results pave a new way for producing novel chiroptical materials with reversible chirality from achiral sources.

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Metathesis&#8208;Based Approach to the Synthesis of the Anti&#8208;Malarial Macrodiolide Samroiyotmycin&#8197;A</title>

Forging of the 20&#8208;membered macrocylic core of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A can be readily achieved by combining a Mo&#8208;catalysed one&#8208;pot alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis ring&#8208;closing metathesis of bisalkyne building blocks and Ru&#8208;catalysed hydrometallation chemistry. These key transformations have enabled the first total synthesis of this anti&#8208;malarial C2&#8208;symmetric macrodiolide.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A (1), a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered anti&#8208;malarial macrodiolide isolated from Streptomyces sp. The convergent synthetic strategy orchestrates bisalkyne fragment&#8208;assembly using an unprecedented Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type condensation on a substituted &#946;&#8208;lactone and an ambitious late&#8208;stage one&#8208;pot alkyne cross metathesis&#8211;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (ACM&#8211;RCAM) reaction. The demanding alkyne metathesis sequence is achieved using the latest generation of molybdenum alkylidynes endowed with a tripodal silanolate ligand framework. Subsequent conversion to the required E&#8208;alkenes uses contemporary hydrometallation chemistry catalysed by tetrameric cluster [{Cp*RuCl}4].

         <title>Heteroleptic Ligation by an endo&#8208;Functionalized Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18582-18586, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage compound is synthesized that is endo&#8208;functionalized with one carboxylic acid and two imidazole moieties. These groups can cooperate with each other to coordinate to Zn(II) and Fe(II) resulting in biomimetic quasi&#8208;heteroleptic transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cage complexes. Coordination of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate to the iron complex leads to an increase of its reactivity towards dioxygen.







Abstract
A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;heteroleptic complexes with properly endo&#8208;functionalized cages as ligands is presented. The cage ligand reported here is of a covalent organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine. Inspired by enzymatic active sites, the described system bears one carboxylate and two imidazole moieties as independent ligating units through which it is able to coordinate to transition metals. Analysis of the iron(II) complex in solution and the solid state validates the structure and shows that no undesired but commonly observed dimerization process takes place. The solid&#8208;state structure shows a five&#8208;coordinate metal center with the carboxylate bidentately bound to iron, which makes Fe@2 an unprecedentedly detailed structural model complex for this kind of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenases. As, as confirmed by the crystal structure, sufficient space for other organic ligands is available, the biologically relevant ligand &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate is implemented. We observe biomimetic reaction behavior towards dioxygen that opens studies investigating Fe@2 as a functional model complex.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer Synthesis by Merging Photoiniferter and Organocatalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18537-18541, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;b&#8208;polyether block copolymers are achieved in one step by combining photoiniferter polymerization of acrylamides with organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of epoxides. The two polymerization systems are compatible with one another, generating copolymers with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality and endowing selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP.







Abstract
Access to block copolymers from monomers that do not polymerize via a common mechanism requires initiation from a multifunctional species that allows orthogonal polymerization chemistries. We disclose a strategy to provide well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;b&#8208;polyether block copolymers by a one&#8208;pot combination of photoiniferter polymerization and organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using a hydroxy&#8208;functionalized trithiocarbonate photoiniferter as the dual initiator at ambient temperature. Our results reveal good compatibility between the two polymerization systems and highlight that they can be performed in arbitrary order or simultaneously with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality. We also demonstrate selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP. We harnessed the efficiency of combining these polymerization systems to provide tailor&#8208;made block copolymers from chemically distinct monomers.

         <title>Strained and Reactive Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Supported Metallasilanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18489-18493, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new stable donor/acceptor&#8208;supported MnI&#8208;metallasilanone was synthesized. This silanone complex is highly strained because of its incorporation in a small cyclic structure formed by the intramolecular silanone&#8208;MnI interaction. Thanks to the high ring strain, the interaction Si=O&#8594;Mn is labile, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity with various small molecules such as H2 or ethylene gas in mild conditions.







Abstract
A novel stable donor/acceptor&#8208;supported MnI&#8208;metallasilanone 3 was synthesized. The intramolecular silanone&#8208;MnI interaction induces a highly strained three&#8208;membered cyclic structure, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity of 3 as a donor/acceptor complex of silanone. Indeed, metallasilanone 3 readily reacts with various small molecules such as H2 or ethylene gas in mild conditions.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Osteopontin Fragment Orders During Interfacial Calcium Oxalate Mineralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18577-18581, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;specific vibrational spectroscopy was applied to study the structure and interaction of central urinary osteopontin peptide at the air&#8211;water interface and during calcium oxalate mineralization. The interfacial peptides show ordered and assembled &#946;&#8208;turn motifs with binding of Ca2+ ions and CaC2O4 minerals, in contrast to the disordered peptide structure in bulk solution.







Abstract
Calcium oxalate (CaC2O4) is the major component of kidney stone. The acidic osteopontin (OPN) protein in human urine can effectively inhibit the growth of CaC2O4 crystals, thereby acting as a potent stone preventer. Previous studies in bulk solution all attest to the importance of binding and recognition of OPN at the CaC2O4 mineral surface, yet molecular level insights into the active interface during CaC2O4 mineralization are still lacking. Here, we probe the structure of the central OPN fragment and its interaction with Ca2+ and CaC2O4 at the water&#8211;air interface using surface&#8208;specific non&#8208;linear vibrational spectroscopy. While OPN peptides remain largely disordered in solution, our results reveal that the bidentate binding of Ca2+ ions refold the interfacial peptides into well&#8208;ordered and assembled &#946;&#8208;turn motifs. One critical intermediate directs mineralization by releasing structural freedom of backbone and binding side chains. These insights into the mineral interface are crucial for understanding the pathological development of kidney stones and possibly relevant for calcium oxalate biomineralization in general.

         <title>Highly Active PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 Nanocomposites Supported on One Dimensional Halloysite Nanotubes for Photoassisted Thermal Catalytic Methane Combustion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18552-18556, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One dimensional halloysite nanotubes supported PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 nanocomposites have good visible light response, which showed excellent performance in photoassisted thermal catalytic CH4 combustion. Its light&#8208;off temperature could be largely reduced to as low as 180&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy inspires us much to design photocatalysts for a variety of thermal catalytic reactions involved by active oxygen species under milder conditions.







Abstract
In this work, we have successfully triggered the aqueous auto&#8208;redox reactions between reductive Ce(OH)3 and oxidative MnO4&#8722;/Pd2+ ions to form PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 (PMC) nanocomposites. PMC could spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into compact encapsulation on the surface of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) to form the final one dimensional HNTs supported PMCs (HPMC). It is identified that there exists strong synergistic effects among the components of PdO, Mn3O4, and CeO2, and hence HPMC could show excellent performance on photoassisted thermal catalytic CH4 combustion that its light&#8208;off temperature was sharply reduced to be 180&#8201;&#176;C under visible light irradiation. Based on detailed studies, it is found that the catalytic reaction process well follows the classic MVK mechanism, and adsorption/activation of O2 into active oxygen species (O*) should be the rate&#8208;determining step for CH4 conversion.

         <title>Neutral Unsymmetrical Coordinated Cyclophane Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18472-18477, August 16, 2021. </description>

We demonstrate how a cyclophane structure can be generated in square&#8208;planar complexes with two different chelating donors (N,O). An ancillary second imine function in the versatile &#954;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;salicylaldiminato catalyst type enables ring closure between two symmetrical 4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;diallyl substituted terphenyl motifs.







Abstract
Cyclophane structures can control steric pressure in the otherwise open spaces of square&#8208;planar d8&#8208;metal catalysts. This elegant concept was so far limited to symmetrical coordinated metals. We report how a cyclophane motif can be generated in ligands that chelate via two different donors. An ancillary second imine in the versatile &#954;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;salicylaldiminato catalyst type enables ring closure via olefin metathesis and selective double bond hydrogenation to yield a 30&#8208;membered ring efficiently. Experimental and theoretical analyses show the ancillary imine is directed away from the active site and inert for catalysis. In ethylene polymerization the cyclophane catalyst is more active and temperature stable vs. an open structure reference, notably also in polar solvents. Increased molecular weights and decreased degrees of branching can be traced to an increased energy of sterically demanding transition states by the encircling cyclophane while chain propagation remains highly efficient.

A diastereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction was developed as an effective pathway to the core tetracyclic skeleton of Cephalotaxus diterpenoids. The construction of the tropone moiety was enabled by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/elimination protocol. Using the strategy, the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid&#8197;F, (+)&#8208;fortalpinoid&#8197;A, and (+)&#8208;cephinoid&#8197;H was accomplished for the first time.







Abstract
3&#8208;Deoxyfortalpinoid&#8197;F, fortalpinoid&#8197;A, and cephinoid&#8197;H are members of the Cephalotaxus diterpenoids class of natural products, which feature diverse chemical structures and valuable biological activities. We report herein the development of a diastereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction as an effective pathway to access the core tetracyclic skeleton, which is found widely in Cephalotaxus diterpenoids. Furthermore, we enabled the construction of the tropone moiety through a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/elimination protocol. Based on the developed strategy, asymmetric synthesis of the title compounds has been achieved for the first time.

         <title>KIO4&#8208;mediated Selective Hydroxymethylation/Methylenation of Imidazo&#8208;Heteroarenes: A Greener Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18454-18460, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, sustainable and chemoselective procedure for the C(sp2)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation and methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes, using KIO4 has been developed. In the presence of ethylene glycol, hydroxymethylated products were obtained in excellent yields, while the use of glycerol in the reaction resulted in the methylenated products. The reaction allows access to the most advanced intermediate of the drug Zolpidem.







Abstract
Herein, we report a KIO4&#8208;mediated, sustainable and chemoselective approach for the one&#8208;pot C(sp2)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation or methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes with formaldehyde, generated in situ via the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol or glycerol (renewable reagents) through the Malaprade reaction. In the presence of ethylene glycol, a series of 3&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes was obtained in good to excellent yields. These compounds are important intermediates to access pharmaceutical drugs, e.g., Zolpidem. Furthermore, by using glycerol, bis(imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methane derivatives were selectively obtained in good to excellent yields.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient, sustainable and chemoselective procedure for the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation and methylenation of imidazo-heteroarenes, using KIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has been developed. In the presence of ethylene glycol, hydroxymethylated products were obtained in excellent yields, while the use of glycerol in the reaction resulted in the methylenated products. The reaction allows access to the most advanced intermediate of the drug Zolpidem.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a KIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated, sustainable and chemoselective approach for the one-pot C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation or methylenation of imidazo-heteroarenes with formaldehyde, generated in situ via the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol or glycerol (renewable reagents) through the Malaprade reaction. In the presence of ethylene glycol, a series of 3-hydroxymethyl-imidazo-heteroarenes was obtained in good to excellent yields. These compounds are important intermediates to access pharmaceutical drugs, e.g., Zolpidem. Furthermore, by using glycerol, bis(imidazo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridin-3-yl)methane derivatives were selectively obtained in good to excellent yields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A TiSe2&#8208;Graphite Dual Ion Battery: Fast Na&#8208;Ion Insertion and Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18430-18437, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiSe2&#8208;graphite Na&#8208;DIB with fast kinetics and excellent cycling stability is for the first time proposed by combining a TiSe2 Na&#8208;ion anode with an anion&#8208;storing graphite cathode. Compared with other Na&#8208;DIBs, the TiSe2&#8208;graphite Na&#8208;DIB significantly improves the Na&#8208;ion insertion kinetics with superior cycle stability. The Na&#8208;ion and PF6&#8722; storage mechanism is investigated.







Abstract
The sodium dual ion battery (Na&#8208;DIB) technology is proposed as highly promising alternative over lithium&#8208;ion batteries for the stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of anode materials seriously impedes their practical implementation. Herein, a Na&#8208;DIB based on TiSe2&#8208;graphite is reported. The high diffusion coefficient of Na&#8208;ions (3.21&#215;10&#8722;11&#8211;1.20&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and the very low Na&#8208;ion diffusion barrier (0.50&#8197;eV) lead to very fast electrode kinetics, alike in conventional surface capacitive storage systems. In&#8208;situ investigations reveal that the fast Na&#8208;ion diffusion involves four insertion stage compositions. A prototype cell shows a reversible capacity of 81.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent stability with 83.52&#8201;% capacity retention over 200&#8197;cycles and excellent rate performance, suggesting its potential for next&#8208;generation large scale high&#8208;performance stationary energy storage systems.

         <title>Alkene Isomerization Revitalizes the Coates&#8211;Claisen Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18509-18513, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic use of alkene isomerization has enabled the first systematic study of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first discovered by Coates nearly forty years ago and rarely applied since. We explore the mediation of this rearrangement by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids and demonstrate the synthetic utility of the products through a concise synthesis of the iridoid natural product isoneomatatabiol.







Abstract
The [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first investigated by Coates nearly four decades ago, is set apart from other variants of the Claisen rearrangement owing to the versatile monoprotected 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl motif featured in the products. Unfortunately, the synthetically elusive nature of the substrates has thus far precluded the widespread application of this attractive transformation. Herein, we show that the key allylic vinyl acetals can be efficiently generated through alkene isomerization of their readily available regioisomeric counterparts (derived from allylic alcohols and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes), thus enabling the first systematic study of the substrate scope of this rearrangement, as well as the discovery of exceptionally mild conditions for its mediation by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

         <title>A Primary Acyl Phosphine Stabilized by a Phosphonium Ylide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18547-18551, August 16, 2021. </description>

The reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 and subsequent reactions are used to access Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 and Ph3PCHC(O)PH2. The zwitterionic nature of these species illustrates this new strategy to stabilization of acylphosphines. Indeed the latter species is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphine, devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.







Abstract
Primary acyl&#8208;phosphines are scarce in the literature. Here we show that the reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 proceeds to give the species Ph3PCHC(O)PH(GePh3) 1. Deprotonation of 1 with Na[N(SiMe3)2] generates the salt [Na(THF)2][Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)] 2 which provides subsequent access to the bis&#8208;germanylated acylphosphine, Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 3. Alternatively, treatment of 1 with HCl in dioxane affords the primary acylphosphine Ph3PCHC(O)PH2 4. Compound 4 is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines and the first devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.

         <title>Construction of Vicinal Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters Through Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Oxidative 1,6&#8208;Conjugate Addition</title>

A diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition that allows facile access to vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with at least one center in acyclic systems is described. The practical asymmetric cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of 2,2&#8208;diarylacetonitriles and a range of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic as well as acyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls proceeds in excellent yields and good to excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The asymmetric construction of vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with at least one moiety in acyclic systems is a formidable challenge. We disclose a solution involving diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition. The practical asymmetric cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of 2,2&#8208;diarylacetonitriles and diverse &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls proceeds, for vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with one center in acyclic systems, in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. The generality of the approach is further demonstrated by the stereoselective creation of vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with both centers in acyclic systems using acyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters as coupling partners. Computational studies elucidate the origins of both diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

Tricyclic cycl[3.2.2]azines, containing a central&#8208;ring&#8208;junction nitrogen atom, have been accessed through aminocatalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition reactions. Pyrrolizine&#8208;based 8&#960;&#8208;components were prepared and used in catalytic [8+2] cycloaddition reactions with diverse activated enals. The developed procedure enabled the synthesis of the cycloadducts, which contain four adjacent stereocenters, with exceptional stereoselectivity (see scheme).







Abstract
An efficient and exceptionally stereoselective synthesis of chiral cycl[3.2.2]azines has been realized by means of the rational design and utilization of novel (E)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolizines in iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition reactions. The presented protocol allows for the incorporation of diverse enals, including cinnamaldehydes, enolizable aldehydes, and substrates of extended conjugation. The obtained products contain both an electron&#8208;rich alkenyl pyrrole moiety and an electron&#8208;deficient carbaldehyde substituent, and both moieties can undergo selective transformations with retention of the stereochemical information established in the [8+2] cycloaddition.

         <title>Atropo&#8208;Enantioselective Oxidation&#8208;Enabled Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylations with Aryl Boronic Esters</title>

A highly atropo&#8208;enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of tetralone derivatives paired with aryl boronic esters as nucleophilic components is presented. The transformation is catalyzed by chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) iridium(III) complexes and enabled by oxidatively enhanced reductive elimination from high&#8208;valent cyclometalated Ir&#8208;species.







Abstract
Atropo&#8208;enantioselective biaryl coupling through C&#8722;H bond functionalization is an emerging technology allowing direct construction of axially chiral molecules. This approach is largely limited to electrophilic coupling partners. We report a highly atropo&#8208;enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of tetralone derivatives paired with aryl boronic esters as nucleophilic components. The transformation is catalyzed by chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) iridium(III) complexes and enabled by oxidatively enhanced reductive elimination from high&#8208;valent cyclometalated Ir&#8208;species.

An activated alkyl electrophile and a silicon electrophile can be reductively cross&#8208;coupled under nickel catalysis with elemental zinc as the stoichiometric reductant. This cross&#8208;electrophile coupling enables for the first time the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond from alkyl electrophiles with an &#945;&#8208;cyano group and chlorosilanes (see Scheme; dtbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl).







Abstract
A nickel/zinc&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of alkyl electrophiles activated by an &#945;&#8208;cyano group and chlorosilanes is reported. Elemental zinc is the stoichiometric reductant in this reductive coupling process. By this, a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond can be formed starting from two electrophilic reactants whereas previous methods rely on the combination of carbon nucleophiles and silicon electrophiles or vice versa.

         <title>Double Ionic&#8211;Electronic Transfer Interface Layers for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18448-18453, August 16, 2021. </description>

The double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers between electrode and electrolyte were created by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene inside the solid&#8208;state lithium battery, resulting in low interface resistance and highly stable interface contact.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries is impeded by the physical limitations of the interface between the electrode and solid electrolyte; specifically, high resistance and poor stability, as well as poor compatibility with Li+ migration. We report double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers grown at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in polyethylene oxide (PEO) electrolyte. For all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4&#8741;PT&#8208;PEO&#8208;PT&#8741;Li cells, the formation of a conductive polythiophene (PT) layer at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface resulted in an at least sevenfold decrease in interface resistance, and realized a capacity retention of about 94&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles along with a lower polarization voltage under a rate of 2&#8197;C. The mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductive layers imparted superior interface stability and contact while keeping good compatibility with the Li anode.

         <title>Generation of Diazomethyl Radicals by Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Their Cycloaddition with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18484-18488, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the generation of diazomethyl radicals and their addition to alkenes is described. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the diazo carbon. This umpolung strategy overcomes the limitations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds with alkenes.







Abstract
A general catalytic methodology for the synthesis of pyrazolines from &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds and conjugated alkenes is reported. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds promoted by the tert&#8208;butylperoxy radical generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the carbon atom attached with the diazo group. The regiocontrolled addition of diazomethyl radicals to carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds followed by intramolecular ring closure on the terminal diazo nitrogen and tautomerization affords a diverse set of pyrazolines in good yields with excellent regioselectivity. This strategy overcomes the limitations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds with alkenes. Furthermore, the straightforward formation of the diazomethyl radicals provides umpolung reactivity, thus opening new opportunities for the versatile transformations of diazo compounds.

         <title>Epitaxial Nickel Ferrocyanide Stabilizes Jahn&#8211;Teller Distortions of Manganese Ferrocyanide for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18519-18526, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;based Prussian Blue analogue prone to destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions upon oxidation is coated with an epitaxial layer of Ni&#8208;based Prussian Blue. This outer layer exerts an anisotropic strain on the lattice of the inner layer, largely preventing structural degradation during Na+ extraction and re&#8208;insertion. As a sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode, the material combines the high capacity and high stability of its two components.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based Prussian Blue, Na2&#8722;&#948;Mn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is a good candidate for sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. Herein, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel&#8208;based Prussian Blue (Na2&#8722;&#948;Ni[Fe(CN)6]). The one&#8208;pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core&#8211;shell materials, which usually needs several steps. The material has an electrochemical capacity of 93&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, of which it retains 96&#8201;% after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles (vs. 37&#8201;% for MnPB). Its rate capability is also remarkable: at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (ca. 55&#8197;C) it can reversibly store 70&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ca. 10&#8722;8&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1. The epitaxial outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, preventing the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de&#8208;sodiation.

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of N2 to Borylamine at a Molybdenum Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic formation of N&#8722;B bonds from atmospheric N2, chloroboranes and electrons is achieved with (triphosphine)molybdenum complexes.







Abstract
Catalytic formation of borylamines from atmospheric N2 is achieved for the first time using a series of homogenous (triphosphine)Mo complexes. Stepwise functionalization of the (triphosphine)Mo&#8208;nitrido complex with chloroborane led to the synthesis of the imido complex. Electrochemical characterization of the (PPP)Mo&#8208;nitrido and (PPP)Mo&#8208;borylimido complexes showed that the latter is much more easily reduced.

         <title>Understanding the Roles of Electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ in Selectivity&#8208;Tuned 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism for cobalt&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation is revealed. A combined experimental and theoretical study shows that a Co3+ species is capable of oxidizing the formyl group to produce carboxylate but remains inert towards oxidation of the hydroxyl group. In contrast, a Co4+ species is required for the initial oxidation of the hydroxyl group in HMF.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is among the most promising candidates for electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the intrinsic active sites and detailed mechanism of this catalyst remains unclear. We combine experimental evidence and a theoretical study to show that electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ species act as chemical oxidants but with distinct roles in selective HMF oxidation. It is found that Co3+ is only capable of oxidizing formyl group to produce carboxylate while Co4+ is required for the initial oxidation of hydroxyl group with significantly faster kinetics. As a result, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co&#8208;catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveals in situ Behaviors of Multiple Components in Aerosol Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mass spectrometry imaging strategy to trace and quantify carbonaceous particles in&#8197;situ is reported by Jie Sun, Caiqiao Xiong, Zongxiu Nie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103874). The method provides not only spatial biodistribution of carbonaceous aerosol at sub&#8208;organ level, but also chemical information of multiple components from these particles based on their intrinsic fingerprints upon laser ablation. This work provides a new ambition to understand how ambient particles translocate and release its surface organic matter in&#8197;vivo.

&lt;p&gt;A novel mass spectrometry imaging strategy to trace and quantify carbonaceous particles in&#8197;situ is reported by Jie Sun, Caiqiao Xiong, Zongxiu Nie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202103874"&gt;10.1002/anie.202103874&lt;/a&gt;). The method provides not only spatial biodistribution of carbonaceous aerosol at sub-organ level, but also chemical information of multiple components from these particles based on their intrinsic fingerprints upon laser ablation. This work provides a new ambition to understand how ambient particles translocate and release its surface organic matter in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Benchmark Acetylene Binding Affinity and Separation through Induced Fit in a Flexible Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the new flexible physisorbent sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn and reveal that it exhibits an induced fit structural change that results in extraordinary affinity for C2H2 that in turn enables high selectivity for separation of C2H2 over C2H4 and CO2.







Abstract
Structural changes at the active site of an enzyme induced by binding to a substrate molecule can result in enhanced activity in biological systems. Herein, we report that the new hybrid ultramicroporous material sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn exhibits an induced fit binding mechanism when exposed to acetylene, C2H2. The resulting phase change affords exceptionally strong C2H2 binding that in turn enables highly selective C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separation demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments. sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn was observed to exhibit at least four phases: as&#8208;synthesised (&#945;); activated (&#946;); and C2H2 induced phases (&#946;&#8242; and &#947;). sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; exhibited strong affinity for C2H2 at ambient conditions as demonstrated by benchmark isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) of 67.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 validated through in situ pressure gradient differential scanning calorimetry (PG&#8208;DSC). Further, in situ characterisation and DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of the C2H2 induced fit transformation, binding positions and the nature of host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Fluoride Chemistry in Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization of tin&#8208;based perovskites is improved thanks to the fluoride in SnF2. The anion of this typical additive is responsible for a more homogeneous nucleation in solution&#8208;processed perovskite thin film formation. In addition, fluoride selectively complexes SnIV and prevents its incorporation in the perovskite structure, as reported by Jorge Pascual, Antonio Abate et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107599).

         <title>HPM&#8208;16, a Stable Interrupted Zeolite with a Multidimensional Mixed Medium&#8211;Large Pore System Containing Supercages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HPM&#8208;16 is a new interrupted zeolite with 3D intersecting 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8197;MR channels containing 30&#8197;&#197; long supercages. The structure, with a very long b&#8208;axis (&gt;50&#8197;&#197;), was solved by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D&#8197;electron diffraction. Degermanated HPM&#8208;16 is stable up to 800&#8201;&#176;C. Several derived structures were studied, including one recently reported.







Abstract
HPM&#8208;16 is a highly porous germanosilicate zeolite with an interrupted framework that contains a three&#8208;dimensional system of 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8208;membered ring (MR) pores. The 10(12)&#8197;MR pore in the b&#8197;direction is a 10&#8197;MR pore with long 12&#8197;MR stretches forming 30&#8197;&#197; long tubular supercages. Along one direction the 10&#8197;MR pores are fused, meaning that the separation between adjacent pores consists of a single tetrahedron that is, additionally, connected to only three additional tetrahedra (a Q3). These fused pores are thus decorated by T&#8208;OH groups along the whole diffusion path, creating a hydrophilic region embedded in an otherwise essentially hydrophobic environment. The structure is built from highly porous 12&#215;12&#215;12&#8197;MR uninterrupted layers that are connected to each other through Q3 producing a second system of 10&#215;10&#215;10&#8197;MR pores. This zeolite can be extensively degermanated yielding a material with high thermal stability, despite its interrupted nature.

         <title>Ethane&#8208;Based Catalytic Process for Vinyl Chloride Manufacture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective and stable chlorination of ethane into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, a key intermediate for the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is demonstrated over rare earth oxychloride catalysts, which will allow record productivities of vinyl chloride upon thermal cracking. This process paves the way for manufacturing PVC from natural gas instead of the currently applied ethylene (oil) or acetylene (coal), bringing significant cost and environmental benefits.







Abstract
The use of ethane as a platform molecule for the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a longstanding challenge, which would allow to reduce the raw material costs and CO2 emissions to produce this plastic. Herein, we discover that rare earth oxychlorides catalyze in a selective (up to 90&#8201;%) and stable (&gt;50&#8197;h on stream) manner the reaction of ethane and molecular chlorine into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, which, upon established cracking, will translate into an order of magnitude higher vinyl chloride productivity compared to ethane oxychlorination technologies. In addition, representative europium oxychloride was supported on suitable carriers and was demonstrated to be selective (up to 90&#8201;%) and stable (&gt;40&#8197;h on stream) in extrudate form. These findings bring the ethane&#8208;based production of PVC one step closer to implementation.

         <title>Surface Density Dependent Catalytic Activity of Single Palladium Atoms Supported on Ceria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just like a well&#8208;played pool game, single atom catalysts lead to novel and exciting catalytic routes. As in the game, the substrate, density of single atoms and their position influences the path and successful outcome.

Binding left&#8208;handed fold or right&#8208;handed fold with flip: A linear hydrocarbon chain containing a diene and a dienophile is folded and transformed into a decalin scaffold via intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition. The substrates are folded oppositely but bind in the same orientation to the pockets of a pair of Diels&#8208;Alderases to yield decalin skeletons with enantiomeric conformations, as reported by Naoki Kato, Shunji Takahashi, Shingo Nagano in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106186).

         <title>Exploring Ultrafast Photoswitching Pathways in RbMnFe Prussian Blue Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond optical spectroscopy and DFT calculations are used by Hiroko Tokoro, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi, Eric Collet et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106959) to investigate&#160;photomagnetism&#160;in the RbMnFe material. Two photoswitching pathways with different dynamics are found. The initial electronic excitation may launch first the reverse Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion or the intervalence Fe&#8211;Mn charge transfer.

         <title>Grotthuss Proton Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new energy storage materials with both high power and energy densities has attracted great interest for electrochemical supercapacitor application. Herein, we synthesize two highly crystalline, robust, hydrophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intrinsic proton conduction by the Grotthuss mechanism. The enriched redox&#8208;active azo groups in COFs can undergo a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making them ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in&#8208;situ hybridized with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three&#8208;electrode specific capacitance of 440 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g, among the highest COF&#8208;based supercapacitors, and can retain 90% capacitances even after 10000 charge/discharge cycles. This work realized the first example using Grotthuss proton&#8208;conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two&#8208;electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71 Wh/kg with a maximum power density of 42 kW/kg, surpassing all reported COF&#8208;based systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromoselective Synthesis of Sulfonyl Chlorides and Sulfonamides with Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photons are traceless reagents in the photocatalytic system, able to control the reaction pathway. Herein, the carbon nitride photocatalyst is used to obtain three products from the same reaction mixture only varying the excitation light. The developed method is optimized for the synthesis of sulfonyl chlorides and amides. Finally, through different physico&#8208;chemical methods, the rationale behind the chromoselective synthesis is explained.







Abstract
Among external stimuli used to promote a chemical reaction, photocatalysis possesses a unique one&#8212;light. Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S&#8208;arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi&#8208;electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis as Efficient Tool for the Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydroxamic Acids for Acyl Nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxamic acids were electrochemically oxidised to initiate acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with 1,3&#8208;dienes. By using alternating current, their often encountered electrochemical induced decomposition could be suppressed to generate the desired cycloaddition products in up to 96&#8201;% yield. The optimisation of this reaction was performed using the Design of Experiments approach.







Abstract
The acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with electrochemically oxidised hydroxamic acids is described. By using alternating current electrolysis, their typical electro&#8208;induced decomposition could be suppressed in favour of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine cycloaddition products. The reaction was optimised using Design of Experiments (DoE) and a sensitivity test was conducted. A mixture of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol served as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane, thus giving products of high purity after evaporation of the volatiles without further purification. The optimised reaction conditions were applied to various 1,3&#8208;dienes and hydroxamic acids, giving up to 96&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Correlating Charge Transport Properties of Conjugated Polymers in Solution Aggregates and Thin&#8208;Film Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different aggregation structures of three BDOPV&#8208;based polymers in solution were obtained via subtle adjustment of the molecular structures. By employing contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we directly reveal that the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains highly consistent.







Abstract
The role of solution aggregates on the charge transport process of conjugated polymers in electronic devices has gained increasing attention; however, the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains elusive. Herein, three polymers, FBDOPV&#8208;2T, FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T, and FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T, are designed and synthesized with distinct aggregation behavior in solution. By combining contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor measurements, we track the charge carrier mobility of the aggregates of these polymers from the solution to the thin&#8208;film state. Remarkably, the mobility of these three polymers is found to follow nearly the same trend (FBDOPV&#8208;2T&gt;FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T&#8811;FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T) in both solutions and thin&#8208;film states. The quantitative mobility correlation indicates that the charge transport properties of solution aggregates play a critical role in determining the thin&#8208;film charge transport properties and final device performance. Our results highlight the importance of investigating and controlling solution aggregation structures towards efficient organic electronic devices.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials Afford Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which showing excellent charge collection properties and multisite defect&#8208;healing effects. All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. All&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.

         <title>Bridge Functionalisation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the known chemistry for the preparation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives reported up to mid&#8208;2021. Bridge substitution on BCP derivatives often provides patent&#8208;free, novel vectors for substituent disposition in drug discovery and materials science; this capacity may prove to be transformational in the coming years.







Abstract
&#8220;Escaping from flatland&#8221;, by increasing the saturation level and three&#8208;dimensionality of drug&#8208;like compounds, can enhance their potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and tert&#8208;butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well&#8208;documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This Minireview aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.

         <title>Cooperative Effects in Switchable Catalysis: Enhancing Double&#8208;Click Reaction Yield of Symmetrical Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like an eagle spreading its wings wide, the closed structure opens its hidden catalytic sites upon addition of an iron trigger thus furnishing a cavity for a double&#8208;click conversion toward rotaxanes. Surprisingly, a close distance match is not needed for double activation.







Abstract
Reversible switching between the closed cyclic dimeric assembly [Cu2(1)2]2+ (OFF state) and the extended dimeric homoleptic complex [FeCu2(1)2]4+ (ON State) by addition/removal of Fe2+ triggered catalysis of a double&#8208;click reaction and high yield preparation of [2]rotaxanes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide valuable general insight for double&#8208;click strategies by revealing cooperative effects in the second cycloaddition step due to a distance&#8208;tolerant preorganization of the first&#8208;click product by the two copper(I)&#8208;loaded phenanthroline subunits of [FeCu2(1)2]4+.

         <title>Modulating the Efficacy of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors through Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination can have important beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, but these effects can sometimes be difficult to predict. Using the vast amount of data obtained on selective, fluorinated inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, this Minireview attempts to give general guidelines on how to wisely insert fluorine atoms within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
The insertion of fluorine atoms and/or fluoroalkyl groups can lead to many beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, such as enhanced metabolic stability, bioavailability, lipophilicity, and membrane permeability, as well as a strengthening of protein&#8211;ligand binding interactions. However, this &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of fluorine atom(s) insertion can often be meaningless. Taking advantage of the wide range of data coming from the quest for carbonic anhydrase (CA) fluorinated inhibitors, this Minireview attempts to give &#8220;general guidelines&#8221; on how to wisely insert fluorine atom(s) within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions, depending on the target location of the fluorine substitution in the ligand. Multiple approaches such as ITC, kinetic and inhibition studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy are useful in dissecting single binding contributions to the overall observed effect. The exploitation of innovative directions made in the field of protein and ligand&#8208;based fluorine NMR screening is also discussed to avoid misconduct and finely tune the exploitation of selective fluorine atom insertion in the future.

         <title>Non&#8208;invasive Regulation of Cellular Morphology Using a Photoswitchable Mechanical DNA Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created a photoswitchable DNA polymer containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides with photoirradiation. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells. This study presents a general strategy to explore nanoscale interactions between stem cells and stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanostructures.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) in which the cells reside provides a dynamic and reversible environment. Spatiotemporal cues are essential when cells are undergoing morphogenesis, repair and differentiation. Emulation of such an intricate system with reversible presentation of nanoscale cues can help us better understand cellular processes and can allow the precise manipulation of cell function in&#8197;vitro. Herein, we formulated a photoswitchable DNA mechanical nanostructure containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides using a photoswitchable DNA polymer with photoirradiation. We found that the DNA polymer reversibly forms two different structures, a relaxed linear and shrunken compact form, observed by AFM. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells between a round shape and spindle shape, thus providing a tool to decipher the language of the ECM better.

         <title>Activation of Aryl Carboxylic Acids by Diboron Reagents towards Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been established. B2cat2 serves as a borylating agent, but also activates the carboxylic acid substrate towards decarbonylative coupling, playing a dual role in this reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals that the reaction proceeds through a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni&#8208;catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni0 catalysts. The key to achieve this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of B2cat2 as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8722;O bond to Ni0 catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product. This mode of boron&#8208;promoted carboxylic acid activation is also applicable to other types of reactions.

         <title>Nano&#8208;analysis reveals high fraction of serotonin release during exocytosis from a gut epithelium model cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5&#8208;HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut&#8208;derived 5&#8208;HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5&#8208;HT release in BON cells is 80% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34%). The fractional release increased from 80% in control BON cells to 87% with 5&#8208;HT preincubation and nearly 100% with the combination of 5&#8208;HT and the 5HT4 autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5&#8208;HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5-HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut-derived 5-HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5-HT release in BON cells is 80% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34%). The fractional release increased from 80% in control BON cells to 87% with 5-HT preincubation and nearly 100% with the combination of 5-HT and the 5HT4 autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5-HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Amidation&#160;of Esters via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct mechanochemical amidation of esters &#8211; enabled by ball&#8208;milling &#8211; is herein described. The operationally simple procedure requires inputs of ester, amine, and sub&#8208;stoichiometric KOtBu and is applicable to a preparation of a large and diverse library of 78 amide structures with modest to excellent efficiency. Heteroaromatic and heterocyclic components are specifically shown to be amenable to this mechanochemical protocol. This direct synthesis platform has been applied to the synthesis of API&#8217;s, agrochemicals, and its ability to deliver gram&#8208;scale synthesis of active pharmaceuticals and building blocks is demonstrated, all in the absence of a reaction solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of bulk&#8208;phase nitride perovskite LaReN3 and topotactic reduction to LaNiO2&#8208;type LaReN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide and oxide perovskites are numerous and many display outstanding properties, ABN  3  perovskite nitrides are extremely rare due synthetic challenges arising from the low chemical potential of nitrogen and a tendency to form low&#8208;coordination nitridometallate anions. Here we report the preparation of a perovskite nitride LaReN  3  through azide&#8208;mediated oxidation at high pressure. High&#8208;resolution synchrotron diffraction shows that LaReN  3  has a low symmetry, triclinic, perovskite superstructure resulting from orbital ordering with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling distortions. Topotactic reduction of LaReN  3  above 500 &#176;C leads to layered tetragonal LaReN  2  via a probable LaReN  2.5  intermediate, the first reported examples of nitride defect&#8208;perovskites. Magnetisation and conductivity measurements indicate that LaReN  3  and LaReN  2  are both metallic solids. The two chemical approaches presented here are expected to lead to new classes of ABN  3  and defect ABN  3&#8722;x  nitride perovskite materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational design of sustainable liquid microcapsules for spontaneous fragrance encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;Food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries rely on microencapsulation to grant the stability of products as well as protection and controlled release of active compounds. Concerning the fragrance technological sector, the high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. In this work, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to produce value&#8208;added chemicals has been intensively pursued. We report a series of CuxOyCz nanostruc&#173;tured electrocatalysts derived from a Cu&#8208;based MOF as porous self&#8208;sacrificial template. Blending catalysts with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) suppressed the compete&#173;tive hydrogen evolution reaction. 25 to 50 wt% teflonized GDEs exhi&#173;bited a Faradaic efficiency of ~54% for C2+ products at &#8208;80 mA/cm2.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have triggered appealing interests in the field of optoelectronics and photocatalysis due to their low toxicity, tunable optical and charge carrier properties. For the application point of view, it is desired to develop stable lead&#8208;free halide perovskites with multifunction. Herein, we successfully developed a series of Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with high stability, which show switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions by varying the amount of Pt  4+  substitution. The Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  solid solution with dominant proportion of Pt  4+  shows broadband photoluminescence with lifetime in microsecond&#8208;timescale. The Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  solid solution with small amount of Pt  4+  substitution exhibits photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. Optical spectroscopy study reveals the switch between photoluminescence and photocatalysis function is controlled by sub&#8208;bandgap states. Our finding provides a new way to develop lead&#8208;free halide perovskites with multifunction and high stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Incorporated Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintaining for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of heteroatom is regarded as one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve the catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS&#8208;TMC), the introduction of heteroatom, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that a light element doping strategy, nitrogen incorporation, can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS&#8208;TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. As a comparison, we also confirm that the introduction of phosphorus (with a relatively large atomic radius) can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER. Our work put forward a new insight into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with highly symmetric crystal structure based on the doping strategy.</dc:description>

Here we utilize biosynthetic instructions contained within metagenome&#8208;derived congener biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to guide the synthesis of improved antibiotic analogs. Albicidin and cystobactamid are the first members of a new class of broad spectrum &amp;rho;&#8208;amino benzoic acid (PABA)&#8208;based antibiotics. Our search for PABA specific adenylation domain sequences in soil metagenomes revealed that BGCs in this family are common in nature. Twelve BGCs that are bioinformatically predicted to encode 6 new congeners were recovered from soil metagenomic libraries. Synthesis of these 6 predicted structures led to our identification of potent antibiotics with changes in spectrum of activity and most interestingly, the ability to circumvent resistance conferred by endopeptidase cleavage enzymes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>PNA&#8208;Guided Peptide Engineering of Aptamer Sensor for Protease&#8208;Unlocked Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protease&#8208;triggered control of functional DNA has remained unachieved, leaving a significant gap in activatable DNA biotechnology. Here we disclose the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer technology that can perform molecular sensing and imaging function in a tumor&#8208;specific manner. The system is constructed by locking structure&#8208;switching activity of aptamer using a rationally designed PNA&#8208;peptide&#8208;PNA triblock copolymer. Highly selective cleavage of the peptide substrate is achieved by protease&#8208;mediated enzymatic reaction that result in reduced binding affinity of PNA to the aptamer module, with the subsequently recovering its biosensing function. We demonstrated that the DNA/peptide/PNA hybrid system not only allows for tumor cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging  in vitro  , but it also produce a fluorescent signal  in vivo  with improved tumor specificity. This work illustrates the potential of bridging the gap between functional DNA field and peptide area for precise biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(I) Complexes Bearing an Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatriene Chain: Catalysts for Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylene and Potential Helical Chirality of 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique and bench&#8208;stable rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain have been synthesized by the reactions of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;rhodium(I) chloride dimer ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2) with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of a 50% aqueous solution of KOH. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated complexes indicated a square&#8208;planar structure stabilized by a strong interaction with one of the aryl groups on the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain, which has a helical structure. The helical chirality of the isolated rhodium complexes was confirmed to be sufficiently stable to be resolved by chiral HPLC at room temperature into enantiomers, which showed mirror&#8208;imaged CD spectra. It was confirmed that the isolated rhodium complex worked as an initiator for living polymerization of phenylacetylene to give  cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene) with a well&#8208;controlled molecular weight.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions of Pd&#8208;TiO2 via In Situ TEM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely used in&#160;supported metal catalysts and extensive studies have been performed to understand the SMSI. Although considerable progress has been achieved, the surface structure of the support, as an important influencing factor, is usually ignored. Here, we report a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI of Pd&#8208;TiO  2  in oxygen by using in situ atmospheric pressure TEM. It is revealed that the Pd NPs supported on TiO  2  (101) and (100) surfaces showed encapsulation. In contrast, no such cover layer was observed in Pd&#8208;TiO  2  (001) catalyst under the same conditions. This facet&#8208;dependent SMSI, which originates from the different surface structure of the support, was demonstrated in a probe reaction of methane combustion catalyzed by Pd&#8208;TiO  2  . Our discovery of the oxidative facet&#8208;dependent SMSI gives direct evidence of the important role of the support surface structure in SMSI and provides a new way to tune the interaction between metal NPs and the support as well as catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysis with Supramolecular Carbon&#8208;Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a new catalysis platform, supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis, which exploits the highly directional weak interactions between carbon centres of catalysts and electron donors to drive chemical reactions. To demonstrate this catalysis approach, we discovered a class of cyclopropane derivatives incorporated with carbonyl, ester and cyano groups as catalysts which showed general catalysis capability in different types of benchmark reactions. Among these typical examples, a challenging tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization can be achieved by supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis. The co&#8208;crystal structures of catalyst and electron donors, comparison experiments, and titrations support a catalysis mode of carbon&#8208;bonding activation of Lewis basic reactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorized CoNi2S4 Yolk&#8208;Shell Spheres for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Production via Water and Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts with excellent activity, robust stability, and multiple functions is crucial for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Herein, porous phosphorized CoNi  2  S  4  yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  YSSs) are rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni  3+  /Ni  2+  couple, enhanced electric conductivity, and hollow structure, the P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of &#8208;0.135 V, 1.512 V, and 1.306 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544 V in water splitting and 1.402 V in urea electrolysis to attain 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  with excellent durability for 100 h, outperforming most of the reported nickel&#8208;based sulfides and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work therefore not only promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production but also provides a feasible approach for urea&#8208;rich wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Design and Crystal Structure of a Highly Efficient Benzoylecgonine Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine, and is responsible for the long&#8208;term cocaine&#8208;induced toxicity due to its long residence time in humans. BZE is also the main contaminant following cocaine consumption, representing a risk to our environment and non&#8208;target organisms. Here, we identified the bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) as a BZE&#8208;metabolizing enzyme (BZEase), which can degrade BZE into biological inactive metabolites (ecgonine and benzoic acid). CocE was redesigned by a reactant&#8208;state&#8208;based enzyme design theory. An encouraging mutant denoted as BZEase2, presented a &gt;400&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency against BZE compared with wild&#8208;type (WT) CocE.  In vivo  , a single dose of BZEase2 (1 mg/kg, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme have the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE&#160; elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was determined, providing additional insights in support of our simulation results.</dc:description>

In vivo  , a single dose of BZEase2 (1 mg/kg, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme have the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE&#160; elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was determined, providing additional insights in support of our simulation results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic denitrification is a promising technology for removing NOx species&#160; (NO3  &#8208;  , NO2  &#8208;  and NO). For NOx electroreduction (NOxRR), there is a desire for &#160;understanding the catalytic parameters that control the product distribution. Here, we elucidate selectivity and activity of catalyst for NOxRR. At low potential we classify metals by the binding of &#8194;NO versus &#8194;H. Analogous to classifying CO2 reduction by CO vs&#8194;H, Cu is able to bind&#8194;NO while not binding &#8194;H giving rise to a selective NH3 formation. Besides being selective, Cu is active for the reaction found by an activity&#8208;volcano. For metals that does not bind NO the reaction stops at NO, similar to CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. At potential above 0.3 V vs RHE, we speculate a low barrier for N coupling with NO causing N2O formation. The work provide a clear strategy for selectivity and aims to inspire future research on NOxRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Observability of paramagnetic NMR signals at over 10&#8201;000 ppm chemical shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an experimental observation of  31  P NMR resonances shifted by over 10&#8201;000 ppm (meaning  percent  range, and a new record for solutions), and similar  1  H chemical shifts, in an intermediate&#8208;spin square planar ferrous complex [  t  Bu  (PNP)Fe&#8211;H], where PNP is a carbazole based pincer ligand. Using a combination of electronic structure theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance, the influence of magnetic anisotropy and zero&#8208;field splitting on the paramagnetic shift and relaxation enhancement is investigated. Detailed spin dynamics simulations indicate that, even with relatively slow electron spin relaxation (  T  1  ~ 10  &#8208;11  s), it remains possible to observe NMR signals of directly metal&#8208;bonded atoms because pronounced rhombicity in the electron zero&#8208;field splitting reduces nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging of Cancer Cells and Dictated Cytotoxicity Using Aptamer&#8208;Guided Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)&#8208;Generated G&#8208;Quadruplex Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology provides powerful tools for developing cancer theranostics. Here we introduce the autonomous surface&#8208;nucleolin&#8208;guided HCR that leads to the polymerization of G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, in which the Zn(II)&#8208;protoporphyrin IX is intercalated. We demonstrate that MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 (Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells, TNBC) with overexpressed surface nucleolin were able to induce HCR leading to the formation of the Zn(II)PPIX&#8208;loaded G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, while the M10 epithelial breast cells served as control. The Zn(II)PPIX&#8208;loaded nanowires allow the selective imaging of TNBC, and their permeation into the TNBC leads to selective cytotoxicity and guided photodynamic therapy toward the cancer cells due to structural perturbation of the membranes. The aptamer&#8208;guided HCR&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains may serve as a versatile tool to target TNBC featuring poor prognosis and high pathological risk of recurrence, thus offering a promising theranostic platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Darzens&#8208;type Epoxidation of Diazoesters: Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly enantioselective Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters with glyoxal derivatives was accomplished using a chiral boron&#8208;Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitated asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;epoxy esters. In the presence of a chiral oxazaborolidinium ion catalyst, the reaction proceeded in high yield (up to 99%) with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr, respectively). The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by conversion of the products to various compounds such as epoxy  &#947;  &#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary  &#946;  &#8208;hydroxy ketone and epoxy diester.</dc:description>

         <title>Template Guiding for Regioselective Fabrication of Uniformly Sub&#8208;nanometric Pt Clusters in beta&#8208;Zeolites with High Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention due to their unique properties as homogeneous&#8208;like catalyst. However, it is a challenge to obtain the uniformly distributed metal cluster under harsh synthesis procedure and reaction condition. Herein, we report a middle&#8208;up protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, in which the precursors of metal ions are anchored in the internal of zeolite by template guidance through electrostatic interaction. The Pt metal clusters with the narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22 nm are obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with broad Si/Al molar ratio from 15 to 200. The strong interaction of Pt and zeolite in Pt@beta is effective to promote the spillover of active hydrogen, giving an excellent activity and stability for hydrodeoxygenation reaction. The proposed strategy provides a general strategy for the regioselective encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolite with high thermal stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Can One Measure Resonance Raman Optical Activity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) is commonly measured as the difference in intensity of Raman scattered right and left circularly polarized light,  I  R  &#8211; I  L  ,  when a randomly polarized light is in resonance with a chiral molecule. Strong and sometimes mono&#8208;signate experimental RROA spectra of several chiral solutes were reported previously, although their signs and relative intensities could not be reproduced theoretically. By examining multiple light&#8208;matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  eCP&#8208;Raman  , a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite&#8208;lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by  eCP&#8208;Raman  , without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of  eCP&#8208;Raman  spectroscopy and for extracting  true  RROA experimentally.</dc:description>
