         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Activity of Cu4 Clusters Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a tetranuclear copper cluster as a model, we modulated coordination microenvironments to boost electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance, uncovering atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity correlations and offering precise ligand&#8208;engineering strategies for advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Surface ligands play a crucial role in modifying catalytic environments and enhancing performance through various mechanisms. However, the multivariate synergistic mechanisms, dynamic evolution patterns, and universal design principles of ligand effects remain to be thoroughly investigated. Metal clusters, with their atomically precise structures, serve as ideal models for studying ligand regulation mechanisms. Herein, we synthesized two copper clusters of N,S&#8208;bidentate ligand&#8208;protected Cu4(PTI)4 and Cu4(BTT)4 featuring identical metallic core structures but distinct ligand architectures and evaluated their catalytic performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Notably, the Cu4(PTI)4 cluster with stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands achieved near&#8208;100% Faradaic efficiency at optimal potentials, significantly surpassing the Cu4(BTT)4. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we unveiled that enhancing the electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of ligands induces alterations in the local microenvironment and electronic structure of metal active sites, thereby exerting positive impacts on electrocatalytic NO3RR performance.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Octasulfur Crystals as Light&#8208;Controlled Molecular Muscles</title>

Bending and stretching effect provoked by the repeated application of 385&#8208;nm radiation (purple) and 475&#8208;nm radiation (blue) on sulfur microcrystals.








Abstract
Here, we describe the synthesis and photo&#8208;responsive properties of 2D cyclo&#8208;octasulfur microcrystals (&#945;&#8208;S8 MCs), produced using a quick, simple, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. Controlled 385&#8208;nm irradiation of these crystals induces an immediate, reversible, and sustained bending effect. The time required for the crystals to return to their initial shape is significantly reduced when exposed to 475&#8208;nm light, completing the entire excitation&#8208;relaxation cycle in less than 2 s. Moreover, this process can be repeated up to 50 times as long as the crystals remain in water. The dependence of recovery time on light wavelength is rationalized qualitatively via highly correlated quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the absorption spectra of S8 chains. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of ring&#8208;to&#8208;chain and chain&#8208;to&#8208;ring transformations: the breaking of &#945;&#8208;S8 rings by 385&#8208;nm radiation induces bending in the &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs, while the excitation of the chains with 475&#8208;nm light facilitates an accelerated recovery process, allowing the S8 molecules to swiftly regain their ring shape. Thus, our study demonstrates that &#945;&#8208;S8 MCs represent intelligent actuators as light&#8208;controlled molecular muscles with the simplest inorganic composition reported to date.

         <title>Cu2O Nano&#8208;Homojunction for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the highly selective, active, and long&#8208;term durable electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethylene by a nano&#8208;homojunction structure of Cu2O, which can greatly improve CO2 adsorption, enrich the key intermediates by co&#8208;adsorbing *CObridge and *COatop and facilitate C&#9472;C coupling step.








Abstract
The efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon products is of great importance and remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective, active, and long&#8208;term durable electrocatalytic production of ethylene from CO2 by constructing a Cu2O nano&#8208;homojunction, which is composed of Cu2O nanocubes in size of &#8776;100&#160;nm and the surface&#8208;adhered Cu2O nanodots in size of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as electrocatalyst. The maximum Faradaic efficiency of ethylene can reach 73.7% at&#160;&#8722;1.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in H&#8208;type cell, with partial current density to ethylene of 38.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it can work stably for more than 200&#160;h at 0.31 A cm&#8722;2 in membrane electrode assembly. The mechanism for the high selectivity, activity and stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion was investigated by in situ experiments and theoretical calculations. The results reveal that such a catalyst is efficient in adsorbing CO2, stabilizing the key intermediate *CO, and facilitating both the *CO protonation to form *CHO and the subsequent *CO&#8208;*CHO coupling for ethylene formation.

         <title>An Atomically Dispersed Photocatalyst for Undirected para&#8208;Selective C&#9472;H Bond Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an atomically dispersed recyclable heterogeneous photocatalytic method for para&#8208;selective trifluoromethylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes without directing groups. Unlike previous substrate&#8208;dependent approaches, this recyclable, atomically dispersed photocatalyst enables scalable synthesis of bioactive trifluoromethylated compounds with high regioselectivity. The findings advance understanding of C&#9472;H functionalization, photocatalysis, and trifluoromethylation, offering broad academic as well as industrial potential.








Abstract
Regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization is pivotal in modern scientific exploration, offering solutions for achieving novel synthetic methodologies and pharmaceutical development. In this aspect, achieving exceptional regioselective functionalization, like para&#8208;selective products in electron&#8208;poor aromatics, diverges from traditional methods. Leveraging the advantages of atomically dispersed photocatalysts, we designed a robust photocatalyst for an unconventional regioselective aromatic C&#9472;H bond functionalization. This innovation enabled para&#8208;selective trifluoromethylations of electron&#8208;deficient metadirecting aromatics (&#9472;NO2, &#9472;CF3, &#9472;CN, etc.), which is entirely orthogonal to the traditional approaches. Mechanistic experiments and DFT analysis confirmed the interaction between Cu&#8208;atom and the aromatic substrate, alongside the photocatalyst's molecular arrangement, driving selective exposure of the para&#8208;selective functionalization. This strategic approach elucidated pathways for precise molecular transformations, advancing the frontier of regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization by using atomically dispersed photocatalysts in organic synthesis.

The evolution of chiroptical activity from chiral molecular monomers to dimers to supramolecular helices is tracked for exploring high&#8208;performance organic circularly polarized lasers. By virtue of the efficient coupling of multilevel chiroptical activity with high optical gain, the chiral organic supramolecular microcrystals exhibit circularly polarized laser outputs with dissymmetry factors up to &#8764;1.3 and quantum yields close to 100%.








Abstract
Chiral organic materials are rapidly emerging as a promising platform for circularly polarized lasing. However, the lag in mechanistic research has severely hindered the development of organic circularly polarized lasers. Here, we attempt to probe multilevel chiroptical activity in organic supramolecular microcrystals for exploring high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. The evolution of chiroptical activity is tracked spanning from chiral molecular monomers to dimers to supramolecular helices. The crucial roles of excimers and supramolecular helices in achieving high optical gain and large chiroptical activity are revealed. Accordingly, circularly polarized lasing with low thresholds and large dissymmetry factors is realized in the organic supramolecular microcrystals. Our work marks the beginning of mechanistic research on chirality induced circularly polarized lasing, which will initiate the rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Confining Asymmetrically Coordinated Cobalt Single&#8208;Atoms/Clusters on Holey MXene for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dual&#8208;coordination microenvironment strategy, CoN1O2 single atoms and Co nanoclusters (NCs) were confined within highly graphitized carbon layers supported on holey MXene nanosheets. The Co NCs optimized the electronic structure of Co active centers, synergistically enhancing peroxymonosulfate adsorption and electron transfer efficiency. A nonradical electron transfer mechanism was proposed to drive the polymerization of bisphenol A.








Abstract
Developing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with asymmetric coordination configurations is essential for enhancing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, precisely regulating the electronic structure and coordination environment of metal centers to further improve activation kinetics remains a key challenge. Herein, we designed asymmetric CoN1O2 single atoms (SAs) sites and Co nanoclusters (NCs) that were spatially confined in highly graphitized carbon layers and supported on holey MXene nanosheet (CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX) via a dual&#8208;coordination microenvironment strategy. The CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance on bisphenol A (BPA) removal, achieving a corrected rate constant (kvalue) of 2750 min&#8722;1 M&#8722;1 and a total organic carbon removal efficiency of 78.2%. Mechanistic studies revealed that BPA removal was dominated by a nonradical electron transfer process (ETP, &#8764;100%), which facilitated rapid polymerization of BPA. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that Co NCs synergistically enhanced the ability of asymmetric CoN1O2 SAs sites to adsorb and activate PMS, significantly accelerating interfacial charge transfer. Furthermore, a catalytic membrane fabricated by crosslinking of CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX and graphene achieved 100% BPA removal in single&#8208;pass mode with a hydraulic retention time of just 40&#160;ms over 24&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides new insights into designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for pollutant removal via ETP&#8208;driven polymerization pathways.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Copper Cluster Nanoreactor for Efficient Catalysis in Chemical Fixation of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise I@Cu8 cluster with high thermal/chemical stability represents the first example of a cluster&#8208;based nanoreactor that demonstrates excellent catalytic activity in chemical fixation of both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols with CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations due to the unique substrate enrichment of well&#8208;defined nanocavities.








Abstract
Chemical fixation of CO2 with propargylic amines/alcohols into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals represents promising and practical routes for CO2 resource utilization, but it remains a great challenge to achieve low&#8208;concentration CO2 conversion in both reactions through one single catalytic system. Herein, a robust copper cluster [(C6H15NH)(Cu8L8I)] (I@Cu8) with nanosized cavities has been constructed. Importantly, the I@Cu8 cluster as a nanoreactor can efficiently catalyze the chemical conversion of both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols with CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, due to the unique substrate enrichment effect of its well&#8208;defined nanocavities. Catalytic mechanism investigation and DFT calculations illustrate that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the simultaneous activation of alkynyl (&#9472;C&#8801;CH) bonds and amino/hydroxyl (&#9472;NHR/&#9472;OH) groups in the I@Cu8 catalytic system, in which the I@Cu8&#8208;substrate intermediates have been confirmed through ESI&#8208;MS analysis. Impressively, this is the first example of a cluster&#8208;based nanoreactor catalyst for low&#8208;concentration CO2 cyclization reactions with both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols. This work provides a foundation for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 conversion into valuable chemicals.

         <title>First Chiral Catalan Solid Based on Molybdenum Halide with Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Deep&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra was successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. This unique Catalan solid structure exhibits efficient deep&#8208;red circularly polarized emission, enhanced stability, and improved photoluminescence quantum yield. The proposed system provides a novel platform for advancing the research on chiral metal halides and paves the way for their application toward chiral optoelectronics. 








Abstract
The design of novel chiral metal halides with exceptional chiroptical properties has attracted significant research attention due to their potential applications in chiral optoelectronics and spintronics. However, developing the deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters is still challenging. In this work, we presented the first chiral molybdenum halide clusters by incorporating chiral methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA) for the design of (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra, which adopt the unique Catalan solid structure. These chiral tetrakis hexahedra exhibit 24 unique 3c&#8208;2e Mo&#9472;Mo&#9472;Cl bonds, which are scarcely reported. Notably, these (R&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 and (S&#8208;MBA)2Mo6Cl14 tetrakis hexahedra demonstrated pronounced circularly polarized luminescence in the deep&#8208;red region, accompanied by an extended emission lifetime of 114.14 &#181;s at room temperature. Additionally, these chiral molybdenum halide tetrakis hexahedra are optically stable for 3 months. The four&#8208;state spin sublevel model was employed to investigate the emission mechanism and found that the temperature&#8208;dependent exciton dynamics lead to the dual&#8208;band emission of the designed chiral tetrakis hexahedra. Our study expands the family of lead&#8208;free chiral metal halides and develops a novel strategy to design a high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;red CPL emitter.

         <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;Modification of Pyridine&#8208;Imine COFs for Enhanced Hydrolytic Stability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;condensation reaction of bifunctional monomers containing both amino and acetal groups yielded COF&#8208;LIFM7. Via subsequent amidation and N&#8208;oxidation modifications, the pore polarity and hydrophilicity of the post&#8208;modified COFs were progressively enhanced, consequently leading to a significant increase in proton conductivity. 








Abstract
Emerging as a type of promising material for proton conduction, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) assembled from dynamic imine bonds face a challenge of surmounting hydrolytic instability to achieve long&#8208;term performance in humid environments. In this work, we report a post&#8208;synthetic strategy to simultaneously enhance the hydrolytic stability and hydrophilicity of a pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;LIFM7, without compromising its crystallinity and porosity. A bifunctional monomer containing amino and acetal groups was employed to construct the primary framework, which was subsequently modified via amide formation and pyridine N&#8208;oxidation to yield COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide and COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide&#8208;N+O&#8722;.

     alt="Stepwise Post-Modification of Pyridine-Imine COFs for Enhanced Hydrolytic Stability and Proton Conductivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-condensation reaction of bifunctional monomers containing both amino and acetal groups yielded COF-LIFM7. Via subsequent amidation and N-oxidation modifications, the pore polarity and hydrophilicity of the post-modified COFs were progressively enhanced, consequently leading to a significant increase in proton conductivity. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging as a type of promising material for proton conduction, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) assembled from dynamic imine bonds face a challenge of surmounting hydrolytic instability to achieve long-term performance in humid environments. In this work, we report a post-synthetic strategy to simultaneously enhance the hydrolytic stability and hydrophilicity of a pyridine-imine-based COF, COF-LIFM7, without compromising its crystallinity and porosity. A bifunctional monomer containing amino and acetal groups was employed to construct the primary framework, which was subsequently modified via amide formation and pyridine N-oxidation to yield COF-LIFM7-Amide and COF-LIFM7-Amide-N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. These stepwise modifications increased the polarity and hydrogen-binding sites within COF pores to improve water affinity, leading to a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the proton conductivity for COF-LIFM7-Amide-N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, reaching 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 95% relative humidity and 70&#160;&#176;C. This study highlights a generalizable post-synthetic approach for tuning the pore chemistry of COFs to achieve high performance in proton-conducting applications under humid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Yet Strongly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Anions Enabling Cooperative Catalysis with Cationic Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable tetraarylborate anion, BBcat, possessing strong Lewis acidity was synthesized. BBcat serves as a weakly coordinating counteranion for the cationic transition&#8208;metal complex, and its Ir complex exhibited up to 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than the common counteranion BArF in the hydrogen isotope exchange of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted arenes by cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition&#8208;metal complex and the Lewis&#8208;acidic counteranion.








Abstract
Ionic transition&#8208;metal complexes play a crucial role as catalysts in organic transformations. Their counteranions often stand aside from the catalytic cycle or occasionally participate in the catalytic cycle as a Br&#248;nsted base due to their nucleophilic character. Herein, we developed a stable yet Lewis&#8208;acidic anion, BBcat, based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and featuring Lewis&#8208;acidic catechol borane moieties and applied it to transition&#8208;metal catalysis to recognize Lewis&#8208;basic substrates. Upon admixture with Bu4N&#8211;BBcat, 31P NMR chemical shift of O&#9552;PEt3 significantly lower&#8208;shifted, implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. Ir/PHOX&#8208;BBcat exhibited an 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX&#8208;BArF consisting of the non&#8208;coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis&#8208;basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis&#8208;basic sites, located at remote positions to the C&#9472;H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis&#8208;basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition&#8208;metal center and the counteranion.

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Accompanying ATP Synthesis in Polydopamine Microreactors Covered by Lipid Bilayers with ATPase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of CO2 accompanying ATP synthesis is achieved by a biomimetic assembled microreactor based on formate dehydrogenase (FDH), Calvin cycle, and ATPase. FDH fixes CO2 into formate by sacrificing NADH, and the Calvin cycle helps the regeneration of NADH. The protons generated by the enzyme cascade reaction drive the ATPase on the biomimetic membrane to synthesize ATP. 








Abstract
Global energy and environmental crises have stimulated increased efforts toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals or energy substance. Inspired by natural chloroplasts and mitochondria, we build an innovative polydopamine&#8208;armored multiple enzyme microreactor for co&#8208;immobilizing glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric phosphokinase (PGK), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and ATPase&#8208;incorporating proteoliposome, providing spatially confined microenvironments akin to natural systems. Within this microreactor, GAPDH and PGK catalyze the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate to 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric acid, reducing &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH and generating a proton influx that drives ATP synthesis. The microreactor possesses strong affinity for CO2, combined with FDH, facilitates the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, oxidizing NADH back to NAD+ and enabling the recycling of the NAD+/NADH redox couple. This process further boosts ATP production by contributing additional protons. Such microreactor adeptly orchestrates the chloroplast's enzymes to fix CO2 and the mitochondrion's enzymes to synthesize ATP into a unified artificial biomimetic system, effectively replicating the glycolysis process to simultaneously achieve CO2 fixation, NADH regeneration, and ATP synthesis. This strategy not only holds great potential to inspire significant design innovations for more efficient ATP synthesis from low&#8208;value substances but also greatly expands the application scenarios for biomolecular motors.

         <title>Hinge&#8208;Like Mechanochromic Mechanophores Based on [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hinge&#8208;like supramolecular mechanophores utilizing [2.2]paracyclophane have been developed. In the force&#8208;free state, the rigid [2.2]paracyclophane forces two luminophores into proximity, leading to excimer&#8208;dominant photoluminescence. Stretching the polyurethane films into which the mechanophores are covalently incorporated results in the structures of the mechanophores changing to more open forms, which leads to monomer&#8208;dominant emission being observed.








Abstract
A hinge&#8208;like supramolecular mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and two excimer&#8208;forming 1,6&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophores is presented. Each luminophore shares one phenyl group with the [2.2]paracyclophane, resulting in a rigid and strained structure that forces the two luminophores into close proximity. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of the mechanophore in THF solution and in solid films of a polyurethane containing the new motif is dominated by excimer emission. Stretching the polymer films causes an easily discernible change from bright yellow excimer to blue&#8211;green monomer&#8208;dominated emission. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress&#8211;strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge&#8208;like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.

         <title>Electrocatalytic C&#9472;S Cross&#8208;Coupling via Engineered Frustrated Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs for High&#8208;Efficiency Methanesulfonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that MOFs catalysts with Lewis acid&#8208;base sites generated by introducing specific ligand groups can produce methanesulfonate through nucleophilic attack, and performance is superior to previously reported copper&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of the Lewis acid and base sites for electrocatalytic C&#9472;S coupling reaction and provides an avenue to produce by abundant resources and renewable electricity.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of sulfonyl compounds under mild conditions remains a significant challenge due to the reliance on harsh reagents, high energy consumption, and low selectivity in conventional methods. Herein, we report a novel strategy for efficient C&#9472;S bond formation through in situ modulation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs within a copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CuBDC&#8208;XN). By precisely engineering electron&#8208;deficient Cu Lewis acid sites and electron&#8208;rich XN&#8208;functionalized Lewis base sites, this bifunctional catalyst enables the synergistic co&#8208;reduction of SO32&#8722; and CO2 into methanesulfonate (MS) at ambient conditions with a Faradaic efficiency of 13.77% (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus RHE). Mechanistic studies reveal that the frustrated Lewis pairs selectively stabilize key intermediates (*CHO and SO32&#8722;) via electrostatic interactions, facilitating nucleophilic attack and C&#9472;S coupling with a reduced energy barrier (0.48&#160;eV). In situ spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations further elucidate the dynamic adsorption&#8208;configuration regulation and intermediate evolution pathway. This work not only establishes a molecular&#8208;level understanding of cooperative Lewis acid&#8208;base catalysis but also provides a universal design principle for the sustainable electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added organosulfur compounds.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into methanesulfonate (MS) at ambient conditions with a Faradaic efficiency of 13.77% (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus RHE). Mechanistic studies reveal that the frustrated Lewis pairs selectively stabilize key intermediates (*CHO and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) via electrostatic interactions, facilitating nucleophilic attack and C&#9472;S coupling with a reduced energy barrier (0.48&#160;eV). In situ spectroscopic analyses and DFT calculations further elucidate the dynamic adsorption-configuration regulation and intermediate evolution pathway. This work not only establishes a molecular-level understanding of cooperative Lewis acid-base catalysis but also provides a universal design principle for the sustainable electrosynthesis of value-added organosulfur compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Outside&#8208;in&#8221; Design of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Linking Specific Peripheral Geometry to Defined CO2 Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; strategy for the design of NC&#8208;supported Fe and Ni SACs for CO2RR. Combined DFT calculations and experimental studies show that incorporating specific six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings into the outer shell retrofit the electronic property of coordination N atoms in the inner shell, thereby precisely controlling the catalytic performance of the metal center.








Abstract
The regulation of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) through microenvironment engineering, particularly via peripheral species, has recently garnered significant attention in the fields of materials science and heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, establishing unambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships for SAC, especially concerning peripheral effects, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy for the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Fe SACs for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal that installing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring in the outer shell modulates the electronic properties of the inner&#8208;shell coordination N species, altering their electron transfer capabilities while fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;p coupling between the Fe center and adjacent N atoms. Notably, five&#8208;membered rings induce stronger d&#8208;p coupling compared to their six&#8208;membered counterparts, leading to a higher Fe valence state. This electronic modulation optimizes the adsorption strength of key CO2RR intermediates (COOH* and CO*), enhancing catalytic performance for CO production.&#160;Extensive experimental studies corroborate these theoretical findings. The proposed &#8220;outside&#8208;in&#8221; design strategy can be extended to Ni SACs, offering new insights into the exploration of highly efficient single&#8208;atom centers through peripheral geometric effects.

         <title>Oxidative Electrocyclization Assembles 2,2&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran in Fungal Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A berberine bridge&#8208;like oxidoreductase mediates oxidative electrocyclization to form the 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran (DMP) ring in fungal indole alkaloids. Heterologous gene expression, in vitro enzyme activity reconstitution, and mechanistic studies unveil nature's strategy for pyran formation via enzymatic electrocyclization, expanding biocatalytic pericyclic chemistry.








Abstract
Pericyclic reactions, such as cycloaddition and electrocyclization, are among the most useful approaches for constructing complex natural products with diverse biological activities. While enzymatic pericyclic reactions have been increasingly reported in recent years, there are only a few examples of enzyme&#8208;mediated electrocyclization reactions. The 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran (DMP) ring plays a significant role in constituting many bioactive fungal and plant natural products. In this study, we characterize the vsc biosynthetic gene cluster of the DMP&#8208;containing natural product versicamide A (1) in Aspergillus versicolor DL0022. The biosynthetic route for DMP formation and the biochemical functions of the involved enzymes are fully elucidated. Specifically, we reveal that the berberine bridge&#8208;like oxidoreductase VscB mediates a crucial oxidative process, followed by an electrocyclization to form a C&#9472;O bridge bond, thereby affording the key DMP ring. Structural simulation, molecular modeling, mutational analysis, and quantum chemical calculations elucidate the oxidative electrocyclization mechanism. The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor of VscB/NotD' facilitates hydride abstraction at the C25 position of the substrate, while the key amino acid residue E529 acts as a general base to deprotonate the C6 hydroxyl group.

         <title>Effect of Ambient Organic Acids on the Water Structure at TiO2${\rm TiO}_{2}$ Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambient organic acids such as formic acid tend to localize in the interfacial water layers close to TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ surfaces, facilitated by the interaction and exchange of the acid proton with a surface oxygen. These localized acids make the anatase surface hydrophobic, which is offset by the larger fraction of dissociated water on rutile. Thus, the wettability of TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ is largely controlled by acid&#8208;base chemistry rather than chemisorption.








Abstract
A molecular&#8208;level understanding of the effects of ambient organic compounds on the wettability of titanium dioxide (TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$) surfaces is relevant to many of its energy&#8208;related and environmental applications. Herein, we focus on two common atmospheric carboxylic acids, formic and acetic acid, and characterize their adsorption/ desorption at the aqueous interfaces of anatase and rutile TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ using molecular dynamics with an ab initio deep neural network potential. Our simulations show that these acids prefer to be localized in the interfacial water layers close to the TiO2${\rm TiO}_{2}$ surface where they are stabilized by the interaction/exchange of their acid proton with a surface oxygen, rather than chemisorb at the surface Ti sites by displacing the adsorbed water. Notably, these acids make the surface of anatase hydrophobic, whereas the larger fraction of adsorbed water dissociation can offset their effect on rutile. These results provide a picture where carboxylic acids control the wettability of TiO2${\rm TiO}_2$ largely through acid&#8208;base chemistry at the interface rather than chemisorption on the oxide surface, a finding that can help improve the design of self&#8208;cleaning surfaces and photocatalytic devices.

         <title>Is a Malleable Active Site Loop the Key to High Substrate Promiscuity? Hybrid, Biocatalytic Route to Structurally Diverse Taxoid Side Chains with Remarkable Dual Stereocontrol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective, dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) entry into myriad Taxotere&#8208;like side chains with Clostridium acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase (CaADH) enzyme is reported. Follow&#8208;on cross couplings expand the structural diversity of the library (36 total examples). The first X&#8208;ray structure of CaADH (1.39&#160;&#197;) reveals both a cofactor anti&#8594;syn &#8220;on/off switch&#8221; and a remarkably flexible loop that is modeled by molecular dynamics simulation.








Abstract
These studies reveal the first structure of Clostridium acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase (CaADH), a protein exhibiting remarkable substrate promiscuity and stereochemical fidelity. The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxotere family of tubulin&#8208;binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters, showing high D&#8208;syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant milataxel (Ar&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;furyl) and simotaxel (Ar&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross&#8208;coupling chemistries performed on the p&#8208;bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti&#8208;conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an (S)&#8208;configured C&#9472;Cl bond, in addition to the D&#8208;facial selectivity, demonstrated across 20 diverse substrates by this remarkable short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase enzyme.

         <dc:description>
We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene (Ge4CHD) derivative. Moreover, the reactivity revealed that the Ge4CHD derivative dissociated into the methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative in solution.








Abstract
We report the properties and reactivity of an unprecedented methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. In the solid state, it undergoes dimerization to afford a 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetragermacyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene derivative (Ge4CHD). Moreover, theoretical calculations on Ge4CHD reveal &#963;*&#8211;&#960; interactions between the two &#960; orbitals (Ge&#9552;Ge) and the CH &#963;* orbital. This interaction is confirmed by a significant red shift in the solid&#8208;state UV&#8211;vis spectrum. In contrast to the behavior in the solid state, the Ge4CHD derivative dissociates in solution into a methylene&#8208;bridged 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative. The resultant 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with S8 to form a novel cage compound containing three S and two Ge atoms. On the other hand, in the reaction with triphenylphosphine sulfide, the in situ generated 2&#8208;thia&#8208;1,3&#8208;digermabicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivative activated the benzene solvent, leading to the formation of a [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition product. Additionally, the 1,3&#8208;bis(germylene) derivative reacted with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to form a three&#8208;membered ring. Its structural parameters and the results of theoretical calculations indicated the zwitterionic character.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Defect Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tandem CO2 Electroreduction and Carbonylation Reactions from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem CO2 reduction with carbonylation reactions represents a promising approach to convert greenhouse gases into valuable chemicals. Herein, we propose a universal &#8216;N/O mixed pre&#8208;coordination pyrolysis&#8217; strategy to construct vacancy&#8208;defect single atom catalysts (Ni1&#8208;, Mn1&#8208;, Fe1&#8208;, Co1&#8208;, and Cu1&#8208;NC) with M&#8208;N3 coordination microenvironment. This vacancy&#8208;defect endows Ni1&#8208;NC with excellent performance for CO2 electroreduction, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% across a wide range of current densities up to 300 mA cm&#8722;2. The generated CO was directly fed to carbonylation reactions, producing organic chemicals with yields of up to 91.7% and leading to produce 1.13 g of benzophenone in a single run. For the first time, the membrane separation CO2 system was integrated with tandem catalytic system, enabling direct utilization of flue gas for benzophenone synthesis with a 76.6% yield. This work offers a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly method for CO2 separation and utilization by feeding industrial waste gas to carbonylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote and Spatiotemporal Modulation of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Croconaine Dyes via NIR Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymerization holds great promise for the fabrication of well&#8208;defined nanostructures. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control over the dynamic assembly of supramolecular polymers using external stimuli remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation strategy that exploits the intrinsic photothermal properties of croconaine&#8208;based molecular building blocks to modulate the aggregation&#8211;dissociation equilibrium of seeds, thereby enabling the formation of supramolecular polymers and copolymers. Light irradiation provides enhanced tunability through adjustments in laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength. Notably, the spatial precision afforded by laser irradiation allows for localized seed dissociation, offering a new approach for spatially controlled supramolecular polymerization. This method also enables efficient light&#8208;mediated gel formation, spatially selective sol&#8211;gel transitions, and healing in supramolecular organogels. These findings demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive strategy for regulating supramolecular polymerization and open new avenues for constructing nanomaterials with programmable structures and functions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of low&#8208;cost, readily available, and broadly applicable reagents for the methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of aryl chlorides is crucial.

Under nickel catalysis and without any additional redox reagent, these reagents efficiently methylate a wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides, chlorine&#8208;containing complex molecules and phenolic derivatives, showing efficient functional&#8208;group tolerance and scalability; they therefore hold great promise for drug discovery and complex molecule synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction begins with nickel&#8208;catalyzed generation of a methyl radical, followed by radical cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Amorphous Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Films for Direct X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) are emerging materials with significant potential for optoelectronic applications, including direct X&#8208;ray detectors. While 0D OMHH single crystals exhibit excellent X&#8208;ray detection properties, their scalability remains a significant challenge due to the time&#8208;intensive growth process and difficulty in producing large single crystals exceeding a few centimeters. This limitation hinders their practicality for large&#8208;area detector applications. Here, we report for the first time the development of amorphous 0D OMHH films via solution processing for efficient direct X&#8208;ray detection. By reacting a non&#8208;crystalline organic halide, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phosphonium bromide (TPPCarzBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have successfully produced amorphous 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films with controlled thickness via facile solution processing. The organic cations (TPPCarz+) feature a lower bandgap than the ZnBr42&#8208; anions, enabling efficient molecular sensitization, where ZnBr42&#8208; anions serve as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz+ cations as charge transporters. Direct X&#8208;ray detectors based on 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving a stable X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 2,165 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at 20 V.mm&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 6.01 nGyair s&#8722;1. The amorphous nature of these films enhances their processability, allowing for fabrication in various sizes and shapes, and making them highly adaptable for scalable detector applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zero-dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) are emerging materials with significant potential for optoelectronic applications, including direct X-ray detectors. While 0D OMHH single crystals exhibit excellent X-ray detection properties, their scalability remains a significant challenge due to the time-intensive growth process and difficulty in producing large single crystals exceeding a few centimeters. This limitation hinders their practicality for large-area detector applications. Here, we report for the first time the development of amorphous 0D OMHH films via solution processing for efficient direct X-ray detection. By reacting a non-crystalline organic halide, triphenyl(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phosphonium bromide (TPPCarzBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have successfully produced amorphous 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films with controlled thickness via facile solution processing. The organic cations (TPPCarz+) feature a lower bandgap than the ZnBr42- anions, enabling efficient molecular sensitization, where ZnBr42- anions serve as X-ray absorbers and TPPCarz+ cations as charge transporters. Direct X-ray detectors based on 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving a stable X-ray detection sensitivity of 2,165 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at 20 V.mm&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 6.01 nGyair s&#8722;1.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enabled Stable Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes via &#960;&#8208;Type Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effectively stabilizing oxygen redox is the most challenging task for practical applications of high energy density Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. However, how to accurately tune the oxygen energy level to achieve reversible redox remains puzzling so far. In this work, we achieve stable oxygen redox in layered Li&#8208;rich materials over the whole voltage range without irreversible O2 release by adjusting the interlayer metal cation environment adjacent to the ligand. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis of metal&#8208;ligand orbital combinations, we confirm the obvious charge transfer from O to Ni due to the &#960;&#8208;type interaction between Ni 3d spin&#8208;down t2g orbitals and O 2p orbitals. Furthermore, Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Ni coordination environment after Li extraction under the &#960;&#8208;type interaction, which enhances the intrinsic competition between anion and cation oxidation, keeping O 2p state below the metal band to avoid over&#8208;oxidation. As a result, the modified material shows improved electrochemical performance and stable structural/interface evolution. This work provides new insights into the relationship between the adjacent metal environment and the ligand O redox reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Active Hydrogen Absorption and Stabilized Cu(I) Species over Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ce Bridges Boosting Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of water activation center to promote active hydrogen (*H) generation and stabilize Cu(I) species are significant for the formation of multicarbon (C2+) products over Cu&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, CeO2 nanograins and CuO nanothorns were selectively deposited on the edges of Cu2O cubes through the seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8208;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic&#160;efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8208;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8208;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4. This work provides new insights into modulating *H absorption and stabilizing Cu(I) species for boosting CO2 to C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus configurations, characterized by their inherent asymmetry, enable directional mass transfer in membrane materials that drives novel and energy&#8208;efficient chemical processes. This Janus superiority spans applications from nanoscale molecular and ionic transport to macro&#8208;scale separation systems with asymmetric spatial architectures. This review provides an analysis of the material foundations including design principles, structure regulation, and scalability challenges underlying Janus membranes. We explore the physics that govern their unique behavior and examine their diverse applications across chemical engineering, including phase transfer, and molecular or ionic transport. Through a multiscale perspective, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Janus superiority in advancing chemical engineering technologies. Finally, we discuss the hurdles in translating theoretical advances into practical applications and propose promising avenues for future research to harness the full potential of Janus membranes and systems in addressing global challenges related to energy, sustainability, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Molecular Weight Multistate Photoswitches Based on Simple Norbornadiene&#8208;Triazine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized and characterized a series of simple norbornadiene(NBD)&#8208;triazine architectures including multistate photoswitches with unprecedentedly high information storage densities. The simple mono&#8208;NBDs served as suitable model systems to investigate the underlying absorption and switching characteristics. To stepwise increase the complexity, a bis&#8208;NBD derivative with symmetric substituted pattern was investigated next. By combination of different NBD substituents with varying electron demands two asymmetric compounds, one bis&#8208;NBD and one tris&#8208;NBD were prepared and investigated. It turned out that in the case of the tris&#8208;NBD selective switching of the individual NBD chromophores is hampered by too closely related optical properties of all three NBD units. On the other hand, the asymmetric photoswitch system containing two NBD&#8208;substituents fulfilled the requirements of a selectively addressable multistate system with an extremely high information storage density. Here, all possible NBD/quadricyclane (QC) combinations including protonated forms thereof and their reversible interconversion could be realized. Our experimental findings were corroborated by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Multiple Hydrogen Bonds of Nucleobases Enable Precise Tunability of DNA&#8208;Polymer Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures manifest enhanced stability and chemical diversity for various applications such as sensing, imaging, immune modulation. However, the functionality of the hydrophobic polymer in the core is often disregarded, leading to limited property tunability of DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures. Herein, we have successfully fabricated tunable DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures by harnessing orthogonal multiple hydrogen bonds (MHBs) within both the core and shell domains. Distinct DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures, consisting of hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNAs have been rationally designed and successfully constructed. The DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures undergo the controlled morphological transformation triggered by hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and surface functionalization by hydrophilic DNA chains. Owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity, the robust MHB interactions for complementary DNAs and nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers are highly selective and orthogonal. Most significantly, the reported core&#8208;driven morphological transformation and surface functionalization of shell layer are general to expand the structural and properties tunability of DNA nanostructures with different DNA sequences. This work provides an efficient and novel route to precisely modulating DNA&#8208;polymer core&#8208;shell nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic core through orthogonal MHBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Activatable PROTAC Prodrug for Tumor Biomarker&#8208;Driven Near&#8208;Infrared Opto&#8208;Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor&#8208;homing cyclopeptide through a tandem&#8208;locking linker, which comprises a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) cleavable moiety, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor&#8208;selective degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem&#8208;activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off&#8208;tumor toxicity of PROTAC.</dc:description>

The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor-selective degradation of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem-activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off-tumor toxicity of PROTAC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Blood Retention and Kidney Clearance of Renal&#8208;Clearable Gold Nanoparticles Strongly Correlate with Renal Injury Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury model, proximal tubular injury&#8212;rather than glomerular leakage&#8212;predominantly determines the renal clearance of gold nanoclusters. The blood retention of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; strongly correlates with proximal tubular injury biomarker KIM&#8208;1, highlighting its potential as a sensitive exogenous blood marker for proximal tubular injury.








Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are typically filtered through the glomeruli and transported along the renal tubules before entering the bladder. However, the effects of glomerular leakage and tubular injury, two common features of kidney diseases, on nanoparticle transport remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the blood retention, kidney accumulation, and renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; in a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model. By correlating its transport with proteinuria and urinary kidney injury molecule&#8208;1 (KIM&#8208;1), endogenous biomarkers of glomerular leakage and proximal tubular injury, respectively, we found that glomerular leakage, as indicated by a &gt;50&#8208;fold increase in proteinuria, did not enhance its blood clearance. Instead, tubular injury significantly reduced glomerular filtration, resulting in elevated blood retention, increased kidney accumulation, and reduced renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328;. Moreover, Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; blood retention exhibited a very strong positive correlation with urinary KIM&#8208;1 (Pearson's coefficient r&#160;=&#160;0.90), much stronger than KIM&#8208;1 correlations with conventional glomerular filtration blood markers such as serum creatinine. This suggests that Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; could serve as a sensitive exogenous blood marker of tubular injury, expanding the diagnostic potential of renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles in kidney diseases.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation in Porous Organic Cage Salt&#8211;Metal Cluster Hybrids for Efficient Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalytic system based on a pH&#8208;responsive porous organic cage salt hybrid has been engineered, where Pd clusters are confined within the cage cavities and radical sites are located on the cage skeletons. Spatiotemporal regulation, combining pH&#8208;stimuli with spatially isolated active sites in proximity, maximizes cooperative performance and enables efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.








Abstract
Developing artificial biomimetic catalysts with precise spatiotemporal control remains challenging. Here, we present a pH&#8208;responsive organic cage salt containing quaternary ammonium moieties ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8208;12X, X&#9552;Cl or Br counteranions) as a platform for constructing such catalysts. Thermally induced electron transfer from counteranions to ammonium moieties generates radicals throughout cage skeletons ([QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X), which, combined with nanocavity confinement, facilitates metal precursor reduction and Pd cluster encapsulation, yielding the hybrid catalyst, Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X. The pH&#8208;responsive cages enable switching between two catalytic states: Pd@[QA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;12X, where radicals serve as active sites while Pd accessibility is hindered by numerous counteranions, and Pd@A&#8208;Cage, where neutralization of ammonium cages to non&#8208;radical amine cages (A&#8208;Cage) restores Pd accessibility by removing counteranions and modulating Pd surface charge. This dynamic switching allows real&#8208;time modulation of site&#8208;specific activity in single&#8208;step reactions. Sequential activation of dual active sites by acid&#8208;base stimuli enables tandem catalysis. Moreover, fine&#8208;tuning the protonation degrees of quaternary ammonium groups with base stimuli unveils an optimized catalyst, Pd@[PQA&#8208;Cage]&#8226;&#8208;6X (where PQA&#8208;Cage refers to partially quaternized ammonium cages). Such a spatiotemporal control maximizes cooperative performance by balancing spatially isolated radicals and Pd sites for efficient orthogonal tandem catalysis of incompatible oxidation and reduction reactions in one pot.

         <title>Controlled Electrocatalytic Glycerol Upgrading to Glyceraldehyde in Near Neutral Media by Cobalt Oxide Lattice Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism is proposed by introducing Ru single atom into the Co tetrahedral (CoTd) site, which switches the rate determining step (RDS)&#160;from reconstruction to adsorbed electrophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (AOM&#8208;HAT) process and resultantly enhancing both glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) activity and glyceraldehyde (GAD) selectivity in neutral media.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol driven by renewable electricity offers a greatly attractive green way to produce value&#8208;added chemicals at much reduced global carbon footprint. However, achieving both the enhanced activity and selectivity for the most&#8208;valuable C3 product&#8208;glyceraldehyde (GAD) of glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) in neutral media, though of great importance, is extremely challenging. In this work, we propose a Co3O4 lattice activation mechanism by introducing single atom Ru (0.36&#160;wt%) into the tetrahedral sites (CoTd) of Co3O4 lattice to significantly elevate the GOR activity and the GAD selectivity. The as&#8208;constructed Ru&#8208;Co3O4/NF only needs 1.16&#160;V to achieve the current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 during GOR and maintains &#8764;60% GAD selectivity (&#8764;90% for C3 products) over a broad potential window, which are the highest reported in near neutral media. This excellent performance has been demonstrated to originate from the introduction of Ru atoms, which activates the lattice active sites of Co3O4 by promoting the rapid reconstruction of the catalyst to generate sufficient Co3+&#8208;(OH)ads electrophilic oxygen species, resulting in not only the accelerated GOR kinetics, also largely enhanced selectivity of GAD by the adsorption configuration regulation of glycerol primary alcohols (C&#945;&#8208;OH) favoring the primary alcohol oxidation pathway.

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;based Multiblock Copolymers from Cascade ROMP&#8208;RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ROMP&#8208;RAFT cascade polymerization strategy was designed to synthesize polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers, which were employed as compatibilizers to upcycle mixed plastics.








Abstract
Plastic disposal has become a serious environmental and social problem. Mechanical recycling of waste plastics is the most widely adopted strategy to address this issue, but if used to recycle mixed plastics, it usually requires the addition of amphiphilic block copolymers. Polyolefins account for almost half of all synthetic plastics, making them ubiquitous in the plastic waste stream. Within this perspective, polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers are highly desirable, but they are difficult to access using traditional strategies. In this contribution, a cascade ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization strategy was developed to prepare various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with tunable polar segments and microstructures. Using this strategy, tunable amounts of the trithiocarbonate RAFT agents were installed in the polyolefin main chain via ROMP. Subsequent chain extension of various polar vinyl monomers via controlled RAFT polymerization formed various polyolefin&#8208;based multiblock copolymers with high molecular weight and good physical properties. These multiblock copolymers were used to compatibilize and upcycle mixtures of high&#8208;density polyethylene/polymethyl methacrylate (HDPE/PMMA) and high&#8208;density polyethylene/polyethylene terephthalate (HDPE/PET).

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Lithium Storage of SrGe2O4S Anode Enabled by In Situ Formed Oxysulfide Matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SrGe2O4S anode demonstrates ultralong cycling stability. In situ formed Li2O/SrS oxysulfide matrix in SrGe2O4S effectively prevents agglomeration of Ge nanodots during cycling, facilitated by pinning effect of Sr2+ and the enhanced polarity of S2&#8722;.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) demand next&#8208;generation alloying&#8208;type anodes with high capacity and low voltage. While silicon&#8208;based anodes are in industrial use, commercial alloying&#8208;type anodes still suffer from excessive volume expansion and inadequate cycle life. Even incorporating silicon&#8208;carbon composites within graphite (typically &lt;20% in commercial products) fails to resolve these limitations. Herein, we report a novel SrGe2O4S anode for ultralong&#8208;cycling lithium storage. An oxysulfide matrix (Li&#8322;O/SrS) was in situ formed around Ge nanodomains. Enabled by the strong covalency of soft S2&#8315; anions and the pinning effect of large Sr2&#8314; ions, this synergistic matrix has demonstrated capabilities to enhance interfacial compatibility with Ge, facilitate efficient Li&#8314; transport, suppress agglomeration of Ge nanoparticles and buffer volume expansion, as evidenced by in/ex situ characterizations, density functional theory calculations, and finite element analysis simulations. The anode harvests a low charging medium voltage of 0.42&#160;V and reversible capacity of 587&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles (8300&#160;h) with 93.2% capacity retention. The LiCoO2||SrGe2O4S full cell delivers a high capacity of 142&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and energy density of 482&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on constructing functional matrix to relieve volume expansion and particle agglomeration of high&#8208;capacity ultralong&#8208;cycling alloying&#8208;type anodes.

         <title>Tunable Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Supramolecular Polymers Toward Application in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitherto thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and supramolecular polymerization have been seemingly incompatible phenomena. Herein, we demonstrate multiple resonance (MR) TADF from supramolecular polymers, which can be tuned, by using a supramolecular modulator approach. Further, a supramolecular solubilization strategy allows for the transfer of these properties to aqueous media, highlighting the potential for future application.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) offers great potential for application in light emitting devices and bioimaging. Supramolecular polymers can offer intriguing properties for the same applications, such as stimuli responsiveness and self&#8208;healing owing to their dynamic intermolecular interactions. However, merging the two has remained a formidable challenge, due to the nonplanar geometry of common TADF chromophores. Herein, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a less distorted multiple resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) chromophore connected to a polymerization inducing building block. The obtained supramolecular synthon is capable of assembling in aliphatic solvents due to combined interchromophore interactions and hydrogen bonding. Within the supramolecular ensemble the long&#8208;lived photoluminescence properties of the chromophore are maintained. Further modification of the photoluminescence properties could be achieved by using different supramolecular modulators in a social self&#8208;sorting approach, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of the photoluminescence lifetime and bandwidth. Notably, the extent of intermolecular interactions can switch these assemblies from kinetically to thermodynamically controlled regimes. Finally, we employ this co&#8208;assembly strategy to move from organic to aqueous media highlighting the potential toward biological applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Responsive Up&#8208;Regulation of Bifunctional Disulfides for Suppressing Protein Misfolding and Promoting Oxidative Folding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;responsive folding promotor was developed by conjugating metal&#8208;binding ligands and a redox&#8208;active disulfide. The oxidative strength of the bifunctional disulfide was enhanced by metal coordination, inhibiting protein misfolding and up&#8208;regulating the oxidative folding capacity under metal stress. The disulfide compound also promoted oxidative folding of a pharmaceutical peptide and was used to suppress pathological protein aggregation.








Abstract
The stress&#8208;responsive up&#8208;regulation process is a sophisticated biological response to maintain cellular homeostasis. In intracellular anti&#8208;oxidant systems, the expression level of oxidoreductases is up&#8208;regulated under oxidative stress, mitigating oxidative damage on biomolecules and enhancing protein folding capacity. Herein, inspired by the biological system, we developed a synthetic folding promotor whose reactivity is up&#8208;regulated under stress conditions. We conjugated two metal&#8208;binding 1,4,7,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) ligands and a redox&#8208;active disulfide to obtain cyclam&#8208;SS, whose reactivity can be enhanced under metal&#8208;induced stress. Metal coordination increased the redox potential of cyclam&#8208;SS, activating it as an oxidant. While CuII ions severely hampered the oxidative folding of substrate polypeptides, cyclam&#8208;SS exhibited bifunctional folding&#8208;promoting properties, i) suppressing CuII&#8208;mediated misfolding and aggregation, and ii) harnessing CuII to enhance oxidative folding. Cyclam&#8208;SS was also useful for disulfide&#8208;bond formation to promote oxidative folding of pharmaceutical and pathological proteins, as demonstrated with proinsulin and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, cyclam&#8208;SS protected cultured cells from copper&#8208;induced stress. Thus, we demonstrated the induction of the stress&#8208;responsive up&#8208;regulation process by a bifunctional folding promotor controlling the folding status of biologically important proteins under metal&#8208;induced stress. The strategy of &#8220;stress&#8208;responsive up&#8208;regulation&#8221; could aid the development of novel synthetic materials for treating intracellular stress and related disorders.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Indium Single&#8208;Atom Sites Anchored on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Single&#8208;Layer Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 into Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electroreduction of CO2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. We developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of a single&#8208;layer zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted as Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH = 1.67) at &#8722;1.8 V vs. RHE, the Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3 mA cm&#8722;2. The system maintains operational stability over 20 hours without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid&#8208;state electrolyte at 4 V full&#8208;cell voltage, Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5 mmol L&#8722;1, 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5&#8208;fold higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: (i) the low&#8208;coordinated In(III) single&#8208;atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single&#8208;intermediate adsorption on high&#8208;coordination metal centers; and (ii) the single&#8208;layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Hydroarylation of Unactivated Alkenes Enabled by Outer&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes provides a direct route to enantiomerically enriched C&#8211;C bonds in aryl&#8208;containing compounds, a key transformation in pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. While recent advances have achieved high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with terminal alkenes, controlled hydroarylation of unactivated interna alkenes remains challenging. Here we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed protocol that overcomes this limitation through a mechanistic paradigm shift. By employing diaryliodonium salts as dual&#8208;function reagents, our method achieves high enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydroarylation of both internal and terminal unactivated alkenes. These salts enable a transition from concerted to stepwise oxidative addition via dissociative single&#8208;electron transfer (DSET), generating a cationic alkyl&#8208;nickel intermediate prone to fragmentation and aryl radical addition.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes provides a direct route to enantiomerically enriched C&#8211;C bonds in aryl-containing compounds, a key transformation in pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. While recent advances have achieved high regio- and enantioselectivity with terminal alkenes, controlled hydroarylation of unactivated interna alkenes remains challenging. Here we report a nickel-hydride-catalyzed protocol that overcomes this limitation through a mechanistic paradigm shift. By employing diaryliodonium salts as dual-function reagents, our method achieves high enantio- and regioselectivity in the hydroarylation of both internal and terminal unactivated alkenes. These salts enable a transition from concerted to stepwise oxidative addition via dissociative single-electron transfer (DSET), generating a cationic alkyl-nickel intermediate prone to fragmentation and aryl radical addition. Mechanistic studies, including a key experiment in 1,4-dioxane yielding an enantiomerically pure solvent-functionalized product, establish migratory insertion as the enantio- and regio-determining step. This approach not only expands the scope of asymmetric hydroarylation but also provides a new mechanistic framework for selective hydrofunctionalization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bicyclic Selenenyl Sulfides with Tuned Bioreductive Step Rates Reveal Constraints for Probes Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reductive activation of dichalcogenide probes by thiol&#8208;type oxidoreductases proceeds through a cascade of consecutive, partly reversible steps. Stereocontrol elements can modulate the reaction rates of these steps to reach substrate&#8208;controlled kinetic selectivity for reductase chemotypes in live cells. We now deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of unprecedented bicyclic selenenyl sulfides (SeSP), arriving at probes that selectively target the mammalian selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase TrxR1. We accessed these densely functionalised cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;thiaselenanes on gram scale over 5 steps by using a regioselective key step that elaborates an unusual, differentially protected 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;aziridine intermediate through sequential one&#8208;pot chalcogen introduction and selenenyl sulfide formation. By profiling a set of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomeric bicycles for their partly or fully reversible reactivity during reductive activation, we show how effects that slow their reduction steps (addition then resolution) can compensate by vastly accelerating subsequent activation (cyclisation) speeds, such that cellular redox processing is effective and TrxR&#8208;selective. More broadly, this study shows how multistep cascade probes can leverage conformational effects and internal noncovalent interactions to differentiate step kinetics along their on&#8208;target versus off&#8208;target reaction pathways, thus achieving reaction&#8208;based target selectivity in complex biological settings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Crystalline&#160;2D&#160;Conjugated&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic&#160;Framework&#160;for Superior Sodium Storage</title>

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, developing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with multiple redox&#8208;active sites and well&#8208;defined structures to enhance the performance of SIBs and elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationship remains challenging. Herein, a 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystal (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH&#8208;TBP) ligand. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic&#8208;level crystal structure of Cu&#8208;TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer&#8208;stacking. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu&#8208;TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Macrocyclic Peptide Probes for Immunomodulatory Protein CD59: Potent Modulators of Bacterial Toxin Activity and Antibody&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents novel macrocyclic peptides with low nanomolar affinity for CD59, an immunomodulatory cell surface receptor associated with human disease. Crystallographic and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies reveal peptide CP&#8208;06 mimics the binding of biologically relevant CD59 interaction partners. Dimeric and lipidated CP&#8208;06 analogues control both complement&#8208;mediated killing of human cells and lytic activity of bacterial virulence factors via CD59 inhibition.








Abstract
CD59 is an immunomodulatory cell surface receptor associated with human disease. Despite its importance in complement regulation and bacterial pathogenesis, CD59 remains a challenging therapeutic target. Research to date has focused on antibody or protein&#8208;based strategies. Here we present a new approach to target CD59 using macrocyclic peptides with low nanomolar affinity for CD59. Through X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies, we identify key interactions that are essential for binding and activity. We find that the macrocyclic peptide CP&#8208;06 adopts a beta&#8208;hairpin structure and binds CD59 through an intermolecular beta&#8208;sheet, mimicking protein&#8211;protein interactions of biologically relevant CD59 interaction partners. We create dimeric and lipidated macrocyclic peptide conjugates as enhanced cell&#8208;active CD59 inhibitors and show that these probes can be used to modulate both complement&#8208;mediated killing of human cells and lytic activity of bacterial virulence factors. Together, our data provide a starting point for future development of macrocyclic peptides to target CD59 activity in diverse cellular contexts.

         <title>Introducing Photochemical Action Plots as a Tool for Unlocking On&#8211;Off Switchable Behavior in a Polymeric Eosin Y Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8211;Kowollik team provides a powerful tool for the investigation of the wavelength dependence of light&#8208;driven reactions. Herein, the methodology is applied to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots. The insights gained from the photocatalytic action plot analysis enable on&#8208;off switching of the activity of a polymeric photocatalyst.








Abstract
Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for investigating the wavelength&#8208;dependent efficiency of photochemical processes. Herein, we apply the photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8211;Kowollik team to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots, paving the way for future in&#8208;depth explorations of the wavelength dependence of similar reactions. Specifically, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the catalytic oxidation capabilities of an Eosin Y functionalized polymer photocatalyst (P1) as well as a small molecule representative of the polymer bound Eosin Y moieties (EY) for the oxidation of triphenylphosphine. Introduction of zinc(II) ions into the system proved to drastically influence the optical absorption properties of both catalysts, accompanied by a pronounced influence on their wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity profiles which is not predictable based on the absorption spectra. For P1, these changes can be reversed by metal&#8208;mediated single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) formation upon base addition, giving access to a stimuli&#8208;responsive polymeric photocatalyst. Detailed analysis of the photocatalytic action plots enabled the identification of a suitable wavelength for the realization of an on&#8208;off switchable polymeric photocatalytic system.

         <title>Thrombus Boring Microrobot Prepared by an Integrated Phase Separation and Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly Process Toward Thrombolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process to fabricate urokinase plasminogen activator&#8208;modified thrombus boring microrobots (uTBMs), composed of microspheres capped with dual&#8208;layered structures of magnetic nanoparticles and cilia nanostructures. The uTBMs allowed for thrombus targeting, fibrin degradation, and controllable rotation to excavate blood cells under magnetic field, for efficient thrombolysis.








Abstract
The pathological formation of thrombi is the primary etiological factor of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, accounting for one&#8208;quarter of global fatalities. Traditional thrombolytic drugs are constrained by short half&#8208;life, low utilization, and severe complications. Inspired by the tunnel boring machine to excavate strata into small rocks, we report urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)&#8208;modified thrombus boring microrobots (uTBMs), prepared by a one&#8208;step integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process, for effective thrombolysis. The uTBMs are composed of microspheres capped with dual&#8208;layered structures of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and cilia nanostructures. In situ observation reveals the integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process of the uTBM within an emulsion droplet.

     alt="Thrombus Boring Microrobot Prepared by an Integrated Phase Separation and Interfacial Self-Assembly Process Toward Thrombolysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an integrated phase separation and interfacial self-assembly process to fabricate urokinase plasminogen activator-modified thrombus boring microrobots (uTBMs), composed of microspheres capped with dual-layered structures of magnetic nanoparticles and cilia nanostructures. The uTBMs allowed for thrombus targeting, fibrin degradation, and controllable rotation to excavate blood cells under magnetic field, for efficient thrombolysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathological formation of thrombi is the primary etiological factor of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, accounting for one-quarter of global fatalities. Traditional thrombolytic drugs are constrained by short half-life, low utilization, and severe complications. Inspired by the tunnel boring machine to excavate strata into small rocks, we report urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-modified thrombus boring microrobots (uTBMs), prepared by a one-step integrated phase separation and interfacial self-assembly process, for effective thrombolysis. The uTBMs are composed of microspheres capped with dual-layered structures of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and cilia nanostructures. In situ observation reveals the integrated phase separation and interfacial self-assembly process of the uTBM within an emulsion droplet. The capped layer of MNPs allows for controllable motion and rotation behavior under the manipulation of a remote magnetic field. The uPA-modified cilia nanostructures grasp and degrade the fibrin network, synergizing with the uTBMs rotation to mechanically excavate blood cells from thrombus individually, achieving &#8764;8.5-fold higher thrombolytic efficacy than uPA alone. This research demonstrates the feasibility of controllably fabricating and modifying complex-structured microrobots via the simple process toward potential thrombus therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Lithium&#8208;Mediated Green Ammonia Synthesis with Water Electrolysis Boosted by Membrane Electrolyzer with Polyoxometalate Proton Shuttles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers a sustainable approach to ammonia synthesis by integrating lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction (Li&#8208;NRR) with water electrolysis (WE). Polyoxometalates (POMs) serve as electron&#8208;coupled proton buffers (ECPBs), enhancing proton transfer while suppressing hydrogen evolution. A three&#8208;compartment flow reactor achieves continuous ammonia production, setting a benchmark for eco&#8208;friendly nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
Integrating water electrolysis (WE) with lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a sustainable route for green ammonia production by directly utilizing protons from water oxidation, eliminating reliance on grey or blue hydrogen. Here, polyoxometalates (POMs) function as electron&#8208;coupled proton buffers (ECPBs) to seamlessly link WE with Li&#8208;NRR in a three&#8208;compartment flow reactor comprising an aqueous anode, an organic cathode, and a gas feed chamber. POMs serve as proton shuttles while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), facilitating efficient ammonia synthesis. The addition of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) enhances catholyte hydrophobicity, mitigating water contamination. By optimizing ECPB concentration, a dynamic balance is achieved between lithium nitride intermediates (LiNxHy) formation and consumption, yielding ammonia at 573.7&#160;&#177;&#160;5.2&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 54.2%. This design advances flow reactor technology by uniquely utilizing water oxidation as a direct proton source, bypassing conventional hydrogen oxidation methods. The use of POMs as proton shuttles establishes a new benchmark for green ammonia production, reinforcing its potential in sustainable chemistry.

         <title>closo&#8208;Carboranyl Analogs of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines: Direct Synthesis from Alkenes via EnT&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to directly synthesize closo&#8208;carboranyl analogs of medicinal chemically important &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines from alkenes is reported. This reaction is enabled by the first formation of closo&#8208;carboranyl radicals by energy transfer (EnT) catalysis and its unique mechanistic features. Several analogs of known bioactive compounds were obtained after downstream modifications.








Abstract
closo&#8208;Carboranes are icosahedral carbon&#8211;boron clusters with unique properties and broad applicability. They particularly stand out in the context of drug development as privileged structural motifs for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and as highly hydrophobic bioisosteres for the rotational volume of phenyl rings. Herein, we unveil the synthesis of N&#8208;protected carboranyl analogs of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines&#8212;widely found structural motifs in biologically active molecules&#8212;via a one&#8208;step alkene difunctionalization approach. Key for our success were the enabling mechanistic characteristics of energy transfer catalysis which we have used for the first time to generate closo&#8208;carboranyl radicals. Downstream modifications gave a series of analogs of amino acids and known N&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists.

         <title>Anchoring Highly Unsaturated Nickel(II) Sites into a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have realized a new strategy of anchoring highly unsaturated Ni2+ sites into large&#8208;pore MOF (Ni2+@NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2) for simultaneously promoting C2H2 adsorption and selectivity, resulting in the most balance reported so far between C2H2 uptake (201.4 cm3 g&#8722;1) and C2H2/CO2 (25.7) selectivity at 298&#160;K and 1 bar.








Abstract
Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) remains a challenge to achieve both high C2H2 uptake and selectivity for a single material. Porous materials with open metal sites (OMSs) have been widely employed to separate various gas mixtures; however, routine OMSs often show the limitation in C2H2/CO2 separation due to the comparable binding affinity with the two gases. Herein, we report a new strategy of anchoring highly unsaturated nickel(II) sites into a large&#8208;pore MOF (Ni2+@NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2) for simultaneously improving C2H2 adsorption and selectivity. The coordination geometry of the anchored Ni2+ ion was accurately determined by SCXRD studies, featuring a two&#8208;coordination model with highly unsaturated OMSs after the activation. This highly unsaturated Ni2+ ion can provide additional binding sites to improve C2H2 adsorption and also enable highly selective binding of C2H2 over CO2 through the specific and strong &#960;&#8208; complexation interactions, as revealed by gas&#8208;loaded SCXRD studies and theoretical simulations. This metalated MOF thus exhibits both significantly enhanced C2H2 uptake (201.4 cm3 g&#8722;1) and C2H2/CO2 selectivity (25.7) than the pristine NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2 (148.0 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 3.8) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, making an unprecedented balance between C2H2 adsorption and selectivity to overcome the trade&#8208;off challenge. Breakthrough experiments on equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixtures afford both the top&#8208;tier dynamic selectivity (14.4) and C2H2 productivity of 114.5&#160;L kg&#8722;1 (&gt;99.5% purity) at ambient conditions.

         <title>Interface Engineered Electrolyte Design Strategy for Ultralong&#8208;Cycle Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries Over Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoropolymer&#8208;containing plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based electrolyte (FPCE) has been fabricated on the basis of the in situ SEI design strategy. The rationally designed polymer network has been shown to optimize the Li+ transport behavior, promote the in situ formation of LiF&#8208;rich inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid SEI and significantly improve the interfacial stability of the lithium anode, thus enabling solid&#8208;state lithium batteries for stable operation from &#8722;10 to 80 &#176;C.








Abstract
Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is the direction of development for the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the suboptimal ionic conductive properties exhibited by the electrolyte, the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites due to the deposition of inhomogeneous Li+ and the potential safety hazards caused by unstable interfaces have seriously affected the cycle life of the battery at extreme temperatures. Herein, a fluoropolymer&#8208;containing plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based electrolyte (FPCE) has been developed by means of a structural engineering process, with the objective of optimizing the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The integration of solvent structure simulation and experimental results demonstrates that FPCE regulates Li+ transport, promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of the LiF&#8208;rich inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid SEI, and enhances the overall stability of the battery. Consequently, FPCE assists in preserving stable LFP|FPCE|Li cells cycling, with 5000 cycles at a high current density of 10 C and an average capacity decay rate of merely 0.00448% per cycle. Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;level pouch cells demonstrate the capacity to operate stably within the temperature range of &#8722;10 to 80 &#176;C. This study provides a valuable strategy for the design of wide&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;A fluoropolymer-containing plastic-crystal-based electrolyte (FPCE) has been fabricated on the basis of the in situ SEI design strategy. The rationally designed polymer network has been shown to optimize the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport behavior, promote the in situ formation of LiF-rich inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid SEI and significantly improve the interfacial stability of the lithium anode, thus enabling solid-state lithium batteries for stable operation from &#8722;10 to 80 &#176;C.

         <title>Interfacial Atom Rearrangement Drives Potential&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY, establishing a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, generating high&#8208;density active sites, and realizing excellent olefin hydrogenation performances in aqueous media.








Abstract
Dynamic rearrangement of metal atoms at heterointerfaces by chemical bond conversion drives high efficiency electrocatalytic processes, which is a new concept in the field of electrocatalysis and a new discovery to directly improve catalytic activity. It is of great significance to explore transformative catalytic systems that directly control the interfacial structure and function of atomic composition. As an emerging 2D carbon allotrope featuring unique sp&#8208;sp2 co&#8208;hybridization, graphdiyne (GDY) offers unprecedented advantages for heterointerface engineering. In particular, the uneven surface charge distribution of GDY, high distribution of active sites and customizable electronic structures provide unprecedented opportunities for the development of a new generation of catalytic systems. Here, we report a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY. The results of atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy characterization revealed two unique interfacial phenomena: i) GDY&#8208;induced massive dislocation formation within NiPd nanoalloys and ii) rearrangement of surface metal atoms from (111) to (200) facets. Detailed spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated the composition&#8208;dependent evolution of elemental valence states and stoichiometric ratios. This atomic&#8208;level restructuring establishes a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, which improves the overall conductivity and intrinsic activity. What is even more encouraging is that this electrocatalytic olefin hydrogenation is carried out in an aqueous solution. The GDY/NiPd/GDY heterostructure achieves exceptional activity (turnover frequency: 6.8&#160;s&#8722;1), stability (&gt;5 cycles), and chemo&#8208;selectivity (&#8722;100%), which is superior to traditional catalysts.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Doped Cobalt Molybdate Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence Imaging for Dynamic Multilevel Information Encryption System Construction and Biomarker Sensing Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exhibiting different efficiencies in converting tripropylamine into free radicals, iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate and cobalt molybdate generate a signal gradient in the ECL image that enhances information multidimensionality. Leveraging this feature, these materials serve as chemical inks for encrypted printing, thereby establishing a multilevel information encryption strategy for information security.








Abstract
Integrating electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging with a multilevel information encryption strategy overcomes the limitations of conventional encryption methods, which rely solely on abstract electrical signals, by providing intuitive visual outputs. Herein, a dynamic multilevel information encryption system based on ECL imaging was successfully constructed, which realizes robust protection and precisely controlled decryption of information through the multidimensional security mechanism of &#8220;biometrics (biospecific recognition of the primary key) &#8211; electrochemical activation (precise voltage&#8208;triggered activation of the secondary key) &#8211; operational sequence dependence (strict matching of the operational timing)&#8211;signal gradient (decryptor judgment)&#8221;. Specifically, we develop a functional chemical ink comprised of iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate and biomolecules, which is applied onto nitrocellulose membranes via micro&#8208;patterned printing to construct biocompatible, environmentally responsive encryption interfaces. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate that iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate accelerates the conversion of tripropylamine (TPrA) into TPrA radicals, forming a signal gradient with the cobalt molybdate catalytic region and thereby further enhancing the dimensionality of information encryption. Furthermore, a chemical ink&#8208;based ECL sensor was developed for ultra&#8208;sensitive detection of the cancer biomarker CA15&#8208;3, demonstrating the dual potential application in biomedical information security and disease diagnosis.

         <title>Lattice Water Deprotonation Enables Potassium&#8208;Ion Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abnormal water deprotonation in a lattice has been predicted in a chained model by density functional theory calculations and further verified by isotropic tracing and experimental electrochemical investigations. The lattice water deprotonation reaction in the initial charging process enables thereafter reversible potassium&#8208;ion insertion/desertion.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a key process in clean energy applications and usually occurs on the surface of catalytic materials. Here, we report the anomalous partial water splitting, namely, water deprotonation behavior within the lattice of hydrated materials modeled by Fe1&#8208;xMgx(C2O4) &#8226; 2H2O (x&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.25&#8211;0.43), which triggers the otherwise inactive framework into an excellent cathode material for potassium ion storage. Density functional theory suggests that redox&#8208;active lattice Fe sites can split crystal water into hydroxyls and hydrogens in the initial charge, rendering thereafter reversible K&#8208;ion chemistries, whereas lattice Mg sites are inactive but stabilize the entire framework. Our experiments validated the as&#8208;predicted electrochemical behavior, and the isotopic tracing unambiguously confirmed the hydrogen evolution from crystal water. This intriguing &#8220;water deprotonation in lattice&#8221; phenomenon may open a new path for the design of cathode materials by electrolysis&#8208;assisted electrochemistry.

         <title>Surface Transformation in Lanthanum Nickelate for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the reconstruction mechanism of catalysts and designing methods to promote reconstruction are crucial for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) research. By employing a ferric ion surface pre&#8208;etching method, rapid reconstruction of the LaNiO3 catalyst is observed at low OER potentials, thus achieving high OER activity and stability.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based perovskite oxides are identified as promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in view of their low cost, highly tunable structure, and potential high activity. However, the performance and catalyst design are hindered by their sluggish surface reconstruction kinetics. We introduce a ferric ion pre&#8208;etching strategy to enhance the surface reconstruction of typical LaNiO3. The hydrolysis of ferric ions generates hydrated protons that corrode the La&#8208;O terminal sites, inducing lattice distortion and lowering the energy barrier for reconstruction. Concurrently, ferric ion substitution for Ni creates crucial active sites after OER reconstruction, and enables the low&#8208;activity LaNiO3 to become highly active and superior to the benchmark RuO2 and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal substantial surface transformation from corner&#8208;sharing to edge&#8208;sharing NiO6 at 1.43&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the surface pre&#8208;etched sample (LNFeIII&#8208;spe). This reconstruction is initiated by the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and transitions to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), underscoring the transformation of distinct OER mechanisms.

Concurrently, ferric ion substitution for Ni creates crucial active sites after OER reconstruction, and enables the low-activity LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to become highly active and superior to the benchmark RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs). In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal substantial surface transformation from corner-sharing to edge-sharing NiO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at 1.43&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the surface pre-etched sample (LNFe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;spe&lt;/i&gt;). This reconstruction is initiated by the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and transitions to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), underscoring the transformation of distinct OER mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Efficient near infrared (NIR) luminescence is highly important for modern optoelectronic fields. In their Research Article (e202505322), Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers fabricated new types of NIR optical waveguides based on transparent rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses using a facile self&#8208;assembly process. This work provides a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence sensitized lanthanide strategy to synthesize molecular glasses with color&#8208;tunable NIR luminescence and extends the function of NIR optical waveguiding into advanced photonic communications.

         <title>An Update: Enzymatic Synthesis for Industrial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalysis has become a sustainable and cost&#8208;competitive alternative to established chemical synthesis, enabling the enzyme&#8208;based production of not only commodity chemicals but (non&#8208;natural) amino acids, (rare) sugars, as well as synthetic nucleotides. These building blocks give access to highly complex molecules with versatile industrial and therapeutic applications.








Abstract
Supported by rapid technological advancements, biocatalytic applications have matured into sustainable, scalable, and cost&#8208;competitive alternatives to established chemical catalysis. This review presents the most recent examples of enzyme&#8208;based solutions for the manufacturing of molecules with extended carbon&#8211;carbon frameworks and multiple stereogenic centers at commercial scale, including peptide building blocks, (rare) sugars, synthetic (oligo)nucleotides, and terpenoids, such as (&#8211;)&#8208;Ambrox&#174;. Novel enzyme classes are highlighted along with their potential applications&#8212;the synthesis of DNA/RNA, the depolymerization of synthetic plastics, or fully enzymatic protection/deprotection schemes&#8212;pointing toward the diversification and broader industrial utilization of biocatalysis&#8208;based processes.

         <title>The Design of Chemically Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of chemically self&#8208;charging mechanisms and the recent progress in the design of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. The challenges and future prospects are also discussed for chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. This review offers insight into potential future directions in the design of innovative chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries are regarded as potential candidates for off&#8208;grid energy storage devices due to their environmental independence and simple construction. Although tremendous research efforts have been recently made to design chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries, a comprehensive review about them is still absent. This review describes the design principles of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries and their self&#8208;charging mechanism. The advances in their cathode materials mainly include transition&#8208;metal oxides or sulfides, Prussian blue analogues, and organic compounds. Subsequently, the strategies of enhancing chemically self&#8208;charging kinetics are highlighted, including the design of materials, selection of oxidants, and the introduction of catalysts. In addition, various applications of chemically self&#8208;charging batteries are also discussed in wearable electronic devices, low temperatures, and all&#8208;pH scenarios. In the final section, the challenges and future perspectives are presented for designing high&#8208;performance chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. It will shed light on the R&amp;D of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries.

         <title>Metal Complexes Stimulating Immunogenic Pyroptosis as Burgeoning Antitumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the cutting&#8208;edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis, elucidating their pyroptosis&#8208;stimulating mechanisms across chemo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, sono&#8208; and targeted therapeutic modalities, and proposes the prevailing challenges and future opportunities in metal&#8208;based immunotherapy.








Abstract
The exploration of antitumor agents with diverse action mechanisms has become an important focus in both fundamental research and clinical oncology, driven by the need for more effective cancer therapies. Metal complexes, with their versatile chemical, photophysical, and biological properties, represent an ideal class of therapeutic and diagnostic candidates for investigating novel antitumor mechanisms. Recent advances have underscored their unique ability to trigger diverse cell death pathways. Among these, pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has garnered substantial attention because of its intrinsic link to antitumor immunity. This minireview focuses on the cutting&#8208;edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis and elucidates their pyroptosis&#8208;stimulating mechanisms across chemo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, sono&#8208; and targeted therapeutic modalities. By dissecting the interplay among pyroptosis induction, biological processes, such as inflammasome activation and gasdermin cleavage, and subsequent immune reprogramming, we provide a thorough overview of the action mechanisms of metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducers. This understanding has inspired the rational development of novel anticancer metal complexes that can remodel the tumor microenvironment and synergize with immunotherapies.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the indirect and direct electrosynthesis of NH2OH. The outlook of performance improvement strategies including catalysts and reactor design is also provided. 








Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) serves as an important industrial feedstock. The conventional production and transportation of NH2OH requires harsh conditions. Recently, electrochemical hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing oxidative species, such as nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide (NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722;/NO), into NH2OH has been developed as a sustainable strategy. However, the over&#8208;hydrogenation product of ammonia is preferentially obtained under electroreduction condition. Thus, the rational design of catalysts structure is crucial to selective electrosynthesis of NH2OH. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances in electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH with emphasis on the design of catalysts structure. Electrochemical synthesis strategy we discussed is categorized by the existence form of product, including indirect electrosynthesis and direct electrosynthesis. Finally, the techno&#8211;economic analysis (TEA) of electrochemical NH2OH production and outlook of performance improvement strategies are carried out to further guide the optimization of reaction system.

         <title>A Biodegradable Radical Polymer Enables High&#8208;Performance, Physically Transient Organic Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable radical polymer with intrinsic memristivity and on&#8208;demand physical transience is presented. We leverage the nonconjugated nature of the radical polymer for a systematic molecular engineering. The polymer enabled a high&#8208;performance organic memristive device comparable to inorganic transient memory devices, now equipped with additional functionalities including optical transparency, flexibility, biocompatibility, and the transience.








Abstract
Electronic devices often demand high reliability and longevity, but they also contribute significantly to electronic waste. Physically transient electronics have thus emerged as a promising alternative in future electronics, particularly in wearable and implantable bioelectronics. In these applications, memristive materials have gained significant attention for their potential to realize neuromorphic systems that offer energy&#8208;efficient, hardware&#8208;based parallel processing. By integrating memristive capabilities with transient behavior, this study bridges these two cutting&#8208;edge fields, creating materials that not only enable advanced computing but also dissociate sustainably. Additionally, we leverage the unique features of soft materials for their tunability, biocompatibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, which collectively enhance this integration. In this work, we first illustrate molecular engineering strategy on a radical polymer. We then proceed to two&#8208;terminal devices therefrom, which exhibit exceptional memory performance of &gt;106 on/off ratio, &gt;104 s state retention, and stability over 250 DC sweep cycles. A flexible, optically transparent, and physically transient crossbar arrays are also developed, which maintain the performance through &gt;3,000 bending cycles and fully dissociate in water at room temperature. This work represents an advancement toward a biorealistic platform with substantial multifunctionality, making it readily translatable to future wearable and implantable neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Photoinitiators for High&#8208;Efficiency Visible LED and Sunlight Polymerization and High&#8208;Precision 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structured dyes enable efficient electron transfer with additives, thanks to their tailored architecture, making them ideal for high&#8208;performance photoinitiating systems. They allow the fabrication of high&#8208;precision 3D printed objects and exhibit outstanding performance under sunlight.








Abstract
This study presents the development and evaluation of five dyes with varying conjugated energy levels and donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structures as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Their photoinitiation efficiencies are systematically assessed under both visible&#8208;light LED and sunlight. Notably, the conversions reach up to 81% within just&#160;30&#160;s under sunlight, demonstrating the ultrafast and efficient polymerization capabilities of the dyes. The efficient electron transfer is facilitated by the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, where the conjugation is reduced or interrupted by the high distortion between the electron&#8208;withdrawing and the electron&#8208;releasing units. This distortion can prevent the overlap of frontier molecular orbitals, decreasing the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of dyes, thereby enhancing the electron transfer reactivity with additives. Additionally,&#160;we propose a chemical mechanism for the electron transfer reaction in the three&#8208;component systems. The study also explores the application of naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]thiazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione&#8208;based dyes as donors in additive manufacturing demonstrating their effectiveness in three different 3D printing technologies, i.e., direct laser writing (DLW), digital light processing (DLP), and liquid crystal display (LCD). These three&#8208;component formulations achieve high&#8208;precision 3D printed objects, with detailed characterization and comparison of the resulting structures.

Abstract
A magical heterostructures of M&#8208;PBAs (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Cu, and Zn) encapsulated by V&#8208;PBA have been successfully obtained by a facile one&#8208;pot coprecipitation method based on the difference in the binding energies of between these metal ions and ligands, and the nucleation rates of different M&#8208;PBAs. Hence, due to the multiple redox pairs, open frameworks, ordered channels, and synergistic effect of two components, the obtained VM&#8208;PBAs have been tested as cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To further inhibiting the hydrolysis of vanadium ions and the collapse of PBAs structures, a series of glycerol&#8211;water hybrid electrolyte with different content of glycerol were designed. Benefiting from the multiple hydroxyl groups, appropriate viscosity and accurate proportion of glycerol, the as&#8208;assembled AZIBs with VMn&#8208;PBAs cathode can exhibit excellent cycling performance (&#8764;73% capacity retain of stable capacity) after 1000 cycles. This work provides a sight of preparation of PBAs nanomaterials and a strategy of improve the cycling stability and rate capacity of PBAs&#8208;based cathodes in AZIBs.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Peptide Nanofibers from a Structured Motif Within Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence (PQYQP), derived from the SRC protein, was combined with the self&#8208;assembly motif (Nap&#8208;FF) to produce intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies that form cell&#8208;compatible hydrogels via enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA).








Abstract
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous in proteins, orchestrating complex cellular signaling through higher&#8208;order protein assemblies. However, the properties and functions of intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies are largely underexplored. This work unveiled a facile strategy for engineering IDP assemblies. We demonstrate that conjugating a structured motif derived from a protein's phosphorylation site to a self&#8208;assembling tripeptide unexpectedly yields self&#8208;assembled nanofibers with intrinsic disorder. Specifically, by using a glycine linker to attach a pentapeptide derived from a phosphorylation site within a random coil region of SRC kinase to the C&#8208;terminus of a widely used self&#8208;assembling enabler, we generated a phosphorylated octapeptide. The octapeptide exhibits cell compatibility and forms a hydrogel upon dephosphorylation of the phosphooctapeptide. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structural analysis of the nanofibers reveals that the peptides adopt two types of helical arrangements but exhibit intrinsic disorder at the periphery of the nanofibers. The hydrogels exhibit decreased protein adsorption with increasing peptide concentration. This study represents the first instance of a structured random coil within a protein transitioning into an intrinsically disordered state within self&#8208;assembled peptide nanofibers, expanding the pool of peptide sequences for IDPs and providing valuable insights for the engineering of peptide nanofibers with intrinsic disorder for the development of cell&#8208;compatible biomaterials.

Chemists have long aspired to construct complex organic compounds the way that plants do by harnessing natural sunlight as an energy source. This study presents an advancement toward this goal via synergistic exploitation of the plasmonic absorption of Cu and the unique redox potentials of excited polysulfide species (S3&#8226;&#8722; and S42&#8722;) on semiconductor surfaces to decouple the thermodynamic limits of photoreduction from photoexcitation.








Abstract
Visible light photoredox catalysis has become a rapidly emerging area owing to its potential of using sunlight to tame previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;harness radicals for organic synthesis. At present, such a blueprint faces a significant challenge, namely how to accomplish thermodynamically demanding reactions with sunlight encompassing a wide range of low&#8208;energy photons. Here, we report a new reaction framework to overcome this bottleneck through decoupling the thermodynamic limits of photoreduction from photoexcitation. This is fulfilled based on the construction of a heterogeneous photocatalyst Cu@CdS possessing in situ&#8208;formed surficial polysulfide species (including S3&#8226;&#8722; and S42&#8722;), which can efficiently harvest solar energy via plasmonic absorption of Cu while manifest sufficient redox potential for activating inert aryl bromides/chlorides enacted by excited polysulfides. We demonstrate that this designed material composes a potent photoredox catalyst for efficient aryl cross&#8208;coupling, borylation, hydrogenation, as well as Birch&#8208;type dearomatization reactions, with good recyclability and stability. In particular, when exclusively using natural sunlight as an energy source, the product yield can still reach up to 90%. Our findings introduce a straightforward yet viable way to progress toward the century&#8208;long dream of leveraging natural sunlight to produce structurally complex organic molecules, just like plants on Earth.

         <title>Engineering a Proximity Biosensor via Constitutional Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel proximity biosensor was introduced based on the principle of constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC), achieving high binding affinity, low background, and robust performances for homogeneous antibody detection in both buffer and human serum samples.








Abstract
Affinity binding&#8208;induced DNA assembly is a fundamental principle for designing proximity biosensors for sensitive and wash&#8208;free protein detection and imaging. However, current design strategies for these biosensors face an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between binding affinity and background signal. Here, we demonstrate that this intrinsic issue can be addressed by using constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC) as a guiding principle in the rational design of proximity biosensors. As exists in a dynamic equilibrium, the constitutional dynamic network (CDN)&#8208;based proximity biosensors can be adjusted to maximize the affinity to the target protein while minimizing non&#8208;specific interactions that contribute to background signals. By further detecting the ratio of agonist to antagonist within the CDN, we also significantly improved assay robustness, enabling the sensitive detection of antibodies in complex matrices such as human serum. With the high affinity, low background, and high robustness, we anticipate that our CDN&#8208;based design strategy will find wide applications in biosensor development. Our study also opens the possibility to engineer protein&#8208;responsive synthetic systems with complex dynamic behaviors and functions.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Enable Improved Performance and Stability of Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonds and ionic liquids were used for the first time to regulate the phase distribution and release residual lattice strain of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites. The PFI&#8208;based halogen bond molecules achieve the regulation of the uniform and continuous phase distribution of DJ perovskite and adjust the lattice strain from the tensile strain to a smaller value of the compression strain. Eventually, the reverse bias stability of (PDMA)(MA)2Pb3I10&#8208;based DJ perovskite solar cells improved over 100 times.








Abstract
The undesired phase distribution and intrinsic residual lattice strain remain the bottleneck for high&#8208;performance and stable 2D or Q&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for the Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) type Q&#8208;2D PSCs. Here, we showcase employing halogen bonds to stabilize the halide anions and fine&#8208;tuning the residual lattice strain by introducing perfluorodecyl iodide (PFI). It reduces the density of iodide species defects and releases the residual tensile strain, leading to more homogenous phase distribution, suppressed carrier recombination, promoted charge transport, enhanced efficiency, and stability. Therefore, DJ PSCs maintain over 81% of initial efficiency after thermal&#8208;light aging (i.e., under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 1 sun illumination) for 952&#160;h, and remain over 91% of initial efficiency after under reverse bias (&#8722;2.5&#160;V, under ISOS&#8208;V aging tests) for over 21&#160;h, representing one of the most bias&#8208;stable Q&#8208;2D PSCs reported so far.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Active Transport</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a synthetic system that uses chemical potential differences similar to biological systems to transport small molecules across a hydrophobic barrier against a concentration gradient. Instead of a complex pumping machinery, transport happens through the transient activation of transporter molecules. Our reaction&#8208;diffusion model identified key parameters for efficient transport, enabling selective sorting of molecular mixtures.








Abstract
Biology uses chemical potential differences from molecules like ATP to drive membrane pumps, transporting molecules across membranes even against concentration gradients. Here, we report a synthetic system that transports small molecules from an aqueous phase (the sender) to an aqueous receiver across a centimeter&#8208;sized immiscible solvent at the expense of chemical energy. Molecules with high chemical potential (fuels) in the sender phase transiently activate the transporter molecules, which enter the immiscible solvent and exit on the receiver phase side, thus allowing transport from sender to receiver against a concentration gradient. Importantly, we show this active transport mechanism transports molecules across a hydrophobic barrier without complex pumping machinery. Using a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, we identify the critical parameters that determine the efficiency of active transport. Selective transport enables the sorting of a mixture of different molecules. In future work, we will use these design criteria to actively transport molecules across membranes, e.g., of vesicles, at the expense of chemical fuel, thereby mimicking biological processes and enabling the feeding of synthetic cells.

         <title>Bulk Measurement of Membrane Permeability for Random Cyclic Peptides in Living Cells to Guide Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some cyclic peptides can cross membranes, which is highly attractive for drug development, but it remains difficult to accurately predict membrane permeability or to test it experimentally for large numbers of peptides. Here, we present a strategy to measure the membrane permeability of hundreds of different cyclic peptides in parallel in live cells. In addition, we show that the data collected for many peptides are suitable for predicting membrane permeability.








Abstract
Cyclic peptides are attractive for drug discovery due to their excellent binding properties and the potential to cross cell membranes. However, by far, not all cyclic peptides are cell permeable, and measuring or predicting their membrane permeability is not trivial. In this work, we assessed the membrane permeability of thioether&#8208;cyclized peptides, a widely used format in drug discovery. We developed a strategy for synthesizing hundreds of cyclic peptides carrying a short chloroalkane tag for the bulk quantification of membrane permeability in live cells using the chloroalkane penetration assay. Permeability data for random cyclic peptides established design rules, indicating the probability of peptides entering cells is strongly increasing if the molecular weight is below 800&#160;Da, the polar surface is smaller than 250&#160;&#197;2, or if there are less than six hydrogen bond donors. From this, machine learning could predict the membrane permeability of random peptides with good confidence, facilitating the future development of membrane&#8208;permeable cyclic peptide drugs.

         <title>Protonated Glutamate and Aspartate Side Chains Can Recognize Phosphodiester Groups via Strong and Short Hydrogen Bonds in Biomacromolecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly negatively charged phosphodiester groups of nucleic acids and cyclic (di&#8208;)nucleotides often interact with amino acids containing polar or positively charged sidechains. Due to charge repulsion with their negatively charged carboxylate groups in their side chains, glutamate and aspartate are considered to be detrimental to such interactions. Here, we show that glutamate residues with pKa values shifted towards neutral pH due to their chemical environment are easily protonated and thus able to form strong hydrogen bonds with phosphodiester groups.








Abstract
Phosphodiester groups occur ubiquitously in nature, e.g. in nucleic acids or in cyclic (di&#8208;)nucleotides important for signal transduction. Proteins often use polar or positively charged amino acids to interact with the negatively charged phosphodiester groups via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. In contrast, the acidic amino acids aspartate and glutamate are generally not considered as important determinants for phosphodiester group recognition. Instead, they are regarded as detrimental to such interactions due to the assumed charge repulsion between their deprotonated, negatively charged side chain carboxylate groups and the phosphodiester. Accordingly, acidic amino acids are often purposefully introduced into proteins to abrogate nucleic acid interactions in functional studies. Here, we show that in appropriate structural contexts, glutamate side chains are readily protonated even at neutral pH and act as hydrogen bond donors to phosphodiester groups using a c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding protein &#8211; the GSPII&#8208;B domain of PilF from Thermus thermophilus &#8211; as an example. Surveying available RNA&#8208;protein and DNA&#8208;protein complex structures in the PDB, we found that hydrogen bonds between apparently protonated carboxylate groups of glutamate and aspartate and phosphodiester groups occur frequently in many different functional protein classes. Thus, the functional role of acidic amino acids in phosphodiester group recognition needs to be re&#8208;evaluated.

         <title>Organic Cage Encapsulated Within Metal Cluster&#8208;Based Open Frameworks: A Single&#8208;Crystal Host&#8208;in&#8208;Host Material with Inter&#8208;Host Charge Cooperation</title>

         <dc:description>
An organic cage&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal host&#8208;in&#8208;host framework is constructed via electrostatic interactions between ammonium&#8208;bearing organic cages and lead iodide clusters. This precisely defined nested architecture facilitates interhost charge cooperation, remarkably enhancing the material's photophysical properties and establishing dual&#8208;host active sites that synergistically boost catalytic performance across a series of cascade reactions.








Abstract
Integrating dissimilar building units of discrete organic cages and inorganic clusters into single&#8208;crystal supramolecular frameworks with tailored architectures and synergistic functions presents a significant challenge. Here, we presented our discovery of achieving such hybrids through electrostatically driven self&#8208;assembly of cationic ammonium organic cages with anionic lead iodide clusters. Notably, by carefully modulating the size, shape, and composition of cationic organic cages, we have constructed an integrated porous host&#8208;in&#8208;host architecture. In this system, the internal cationic cage snugly resided, encapsulated within the external network constructed from anionic lead iodide clusters. This unique nested hierarchy showcased enhanced interhost interactions facilitated by electrostatic forces, which intricately tailored the electronic structure of the outer lead iodide moiety. As a result, the hybrid demonstrated distinguished photophysical properties, including efficient oxygen activation and enhanced photothermal conversion capability, as confirmed by comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses. The critical role of interhost electrostatic interactions was further demonstrated through a systematic comparison with a structurally similar host&#8208;in&#8208;host architecture comprising lead iodide clusters and neutral amine cages. Furthermore, the integrated and compartmentalized dual&#8208;host served as spatially isolated dual active sites for cascade reactions, exhibiting 33&#8211;47&#8208;folds enhancement in activity compared to structural counterparts lacking charge cooperation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks at the Edge of Stability: Mediating Node Distortion to Access Metastable Nanoparticle Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ total scattering during nanoscale TiO2 formation from a MOF precursor shows that the local MOF node geometry is preserved in the nanoparticles formed under mild conditions. The node geometry depends on the chemical environment of the MOF, which can be tuned to increase the yield of nano&#8208;brookite, a TiO2 polymorph that is difficult to synthesize by traditional methods. Thus, this offers a new strategy to control nanoparticle synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as unconventional precursors for nanoparticle synthesis, with potential to leverage their tunable structures and chemistry to achieve nanomaterials with structures and compositions inaccessible via traditional synthetic routes. Here, we use in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) measurements to investigate how the dynamic structure of MOFs at the edge of stability influences their transformation into different metastable polymorphs. Our study reveals that the local structural features of metal&#8208;oxo MOF nodes at elevated temperatures are linked to the resulting nanoparticle structures formed under mild conditions. Focusing on the titanium&#8208;based MOF MIL&#8208;125, we demonstrate that manipulating the chemical environment to facilitate transformation of the Ti8 node geometry promotes formation of metastable, nanometer&#8208;scale TiO2 brookite rather than the more common anatase and rutile TiO2 polymorphs typically produced through MOF pyrolysis at high temperature. These findings highlight the potential to harness the MOF topology and chemical environment to design and control node distortions and enable access to exotic metastable nanoparticle states.

         <title>LC&#8208;MS and High&#8208;Throughput Data Processing Solutions for Lipid Metabolic Tracing Using Bioorthogonal Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high&#8208;throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using bioorthogonal alkyne fatty acids and optimized LC&#8208;MS workflow. Applied to human fibrosarcoma cells, the method traced fatty acid metabolism, revealing nuances in sphingolipid routing and metabolic bottlenecks, highlighting its potential for lipidomics research.








Abstract
Tracing lipid metabolism in mammalian cells presents a significant technological challenge due to the vast structural diversity of lipids involved in multiple metabolic routes. Bioorthogonal approaches based on click chemistry have revolutionized analytical performance in lipid tracing. When adapted for mass spectrometry (MS), they enable highly specific and sensitive analyses of lipid transformations at the lipidome scale. Here, we advance this approach by integrating liquid chromatography (LC) prior to MS detection and developing a software&#8208;assisted workflow for high&#8208;throughput data processing. LC separation resolved labeled and unmodified lipids, enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of both lipidome fractions, as well as isomeric lipid species. Using synthetic standards and endogenously produced alkyne lipids, we characterized LC&#8208;MS behavior, including preferential adduct formation and the extent of in&#8208;source fragmentation. Specific fragmentation rules, derived from tandem MS experiments for 23 lipid subclasses, were implemented in Lipostar2 software for high&#8208;throughput annotation and quantification of labeled lipids. Applying this platform, we traced metabolic pathways of palmitic and oleic acid alkynes, revealing distinct lipid incorporation patterns and metabolic bottlenecks. Altogether, here we provide an integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high&#8208;throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using LC&#8208;MS workflow.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Electrocatalysts for Boosting Glycerol Upgrading Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D conjugated [Ni3(HHTQ)2]n MOF (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) with Ni&#8211;O4 node can be simultaneously utilised as a catalyst for glycerol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, showing high catalytic activity and selectivity. The in situ measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the reaction mechanism, active centres, and origin of outstanding performance.








Abstract
The valorisation of glycerol using renewable electricity is recognised as an effective and attractive approach for producing high&#8208;value compounds from biomass byproducts. 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts due to their tunable structures, high electronic conductivity, and efficient utilisation of well&#8208;defined active centres. In this study, we report the first systematic investigation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs containing Ni&#8208;X4 (X&#160;=&#160;O or N) moieties for the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), examining key factors influencing both electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. In situ 13C electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopies provide insights into the GOR mechanism and confirm that Ni&#8211;O4 sites are the primary active centres. Theoretical calculations further reveal that [Ni3(HHTQ)2]n (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) exhibits superior GOR activity due to strong adsorption of reaction intermediates and weak interlayer interactions. This work highlights the potential of 2D c&#8208;MOFs as highly efficient GOR catalysts, paving the way for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and contributing to the development of sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies.

&lt;p&gt;The 2D conjugated [Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; MOF (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13-hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) with Ni&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; node can be simultaneously utilised as a catalyst for glycerol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, showing high catalytic activity and selectivity. The in situ measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the reaction mechanism, active centres, and origin of outstanding performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The valorisation of glycerol using renewable electricity is recognised as an effective and attractive approach for producing high-value compounds from biomass byproducts. 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts due to their tunable structures, high electronic conductivity, and efficient utilisation of well-defined active centres. In this study, we report the first systematic investigation of 2D c-MOFs containing Ni-X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (X&#160;=&#160;O or N) moieties for the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), examining key factors influencing both electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. In situ &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopies provide insights into the GOR mechanism and confirm that Ni&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites are the primary active centres. Theoretical calculations further reveal that [Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13-hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) exhibits superior GOR activity due to strong adsorption of reaction intermediates and weak interlayer interactions. This work highlights the potential of 2D c-MOFs as highly efficient GOR catalysts, paving the way for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and contributing to the development of sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Main Group Mechanocatalytic CO2 Valorisation to Cyclocarbonate Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a scalable mechanocatalytic method for synthesizing cyclic carbonates from solid and liquid epoxides using CO&#8322; at 1 bar and room temperature. Employing a gallium aminotrisphenolate catalyst, this process achieves high yields, efficiently transforms multi&#8208;terminal epoxides, and outperforms solution&#8208;based methods in green metrics, setting a benchmark for sustainable synthesis.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, main group elements have gained attention as promising substitutes for precious metals in catalytic processes. Additionally, mechanochemistry is emerging as a field with the potential to promote catalytic reactions under mild conditions. Herein, we report a scalable, main&#8208;group mechanocatalytic synthesis of cyclic carbonates from both solid and liquid epoxides, using CO&#8322; as a renewable feedstock under mild conditions with a gallium aminotrisphenolate catalyst. Unlike solution&#8208;based methods that generally require high temperatures and/or high CO&#8322; pressures, this mechanocatalytic process operates at just 1 bar and room temperature. The developed mechanochemical method affords the targeted compounds in high yields while also enabling efficient transformation of multi&#8208;terminal epoxides and avoiding the conversion losses typically observed in solution. Furthermore, this scalable method outperforms solution&#8208;based approaches across all green metrics, setting a new benchmark for environmentally friendly synthesis.

         <title>Plasmonic Ion Diode Membrane (PIDM) for Enhanced Nanofluidic Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a plasmonic ion diode membrane (PIDM) using COFs and 3D AuNPs to overcome permselectivity and ion concentration polarization (ICP) limitations in nanofluidic ion transport and osmotic energy harvesting. The optimized PIDM achieves 65.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 power density, demonstrating a synergistic plasmonics&#8208;ion diode strategy for efficient energy conversion.









Abstract
Efficient applications of nanofluidic devices are often limited by the insufficient ion permselectivity and inherent ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomenon. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired plasmonic ion diode membrane (PIDM) was designed and fabricated for enhanced ion transport and osmotic energy harvesting by integrating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and three&#8208;dimensional Au nanoparticles (3D AuNPs) into anode aluminum oxide (AAO). Under light irradiation, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation of 3D AuNPs can release huge plasmonic heat and produce abundant hot charge carriers (hot electrons and holes) simultaneously. The former heats the solution and generates a thermal gradient for boosting ion flux, while the latter transfers to the COFs layer, increasing charge density for promoting ion permselectivity. Importantly, it has been found that different COFs with varied pore sizes and charges have an obvious influence on energy harvesting efficiency. Under the optimum condition, a high output power density of 65.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 in a 500&#8208;fold concentration gradient could be achieved. This work provides a practical and efficient way to boost ion transport and enhance osmotic energy conversion by utilizing the synergistic effect of plasmonics and ion diode (ID) property.

         <title>Unprecedented Tetravalent Uranium Photocatalysts for Efficient C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) Bond Cleavage and Formation</title>

We report the discovery of the first tetravalent uranium photocatalyst that efficiently enables C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage and formation under visible light, providing a new platform for uranium&#8208;based photocatalysis and bond functionalization.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a pivotal area in synthetic chemistry. Despite extensive application potential in nuclear industry, uranium&#8208;based photocatalysts are historically limited to uranyl(VI/V) redox cycle. Here, we report the discovery of the first tetravalent uranium [U(IV)] photocatalyst that enables efficient C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage and formation under ideal visible light. The U(IV) alkoxy species mediates C&#9472;C bond cleavage in a wide range of cycloalkanols and promotes their coupling with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, providing access to previously unattainable molecular architectures. These U(IV) alkoxy complexes, fully characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and magnetic studies, exhibit exceptional photocatalytic efficiency. Quantum chemical studies reveal that the energy barrier for C&#9472;C bond cleavage and formation is reduced to below 10 kcal &#183; mol&#8722;1 under visible light excitation. This work introduces a new mechanistic paradigm for uranium&#8208;based photocatalysis and positions U(IV) alkoxy complexes as a versatile platform for bond activation and functionalization, expanding the potential applications of depleted uranium in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring Zn&#8208;ion Solvation Structures for Enhanced Durability and Efficiency in Zinc&#8211;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a strategy to improve aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) by tuning Zn2+ solvation structures using a hydrogen bond&#8208;accepting cosolvent. This approach stabilizes pH, suppresses hydrogen evolution, and enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility&#8212;offering a pathway to durable, high&#8208;efficiency ZBFBs for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) are among the most appealing technologies for large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their scalability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, safety and sustainability. However, their long&#8208;term durability is challenged by issues like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendritic zinc electroplating. Herein, we address these challenges by reshaping the Zn2+ ion solvation structures in zinc bromide (ZnBr2) aqueous electrolytes using a robust hydrogen bond acceptor as a cosolvent additive. Our findings highlight the critical role of interactions within the first and second Zn2+ solvation shells in determining electrochemical performance. By selectively incorporating a low volume percentage of organic additive into the second coordination shell of Zn2+, we achieve effective proton capture, electrolyte pH stabilization during the Zn0 electroplating, and mitigation of ion transport resistance. This approach prevents the formation of a passivation interphase layer on the electrode surface, which typically occurs with higher additive concentrations, leading to increased interphase resistance and cell polarization. This work opens a new avenue in modulating Zn2+ reactivity and stability through precise solvation structure design, enabling efficient and reversible Zn0/2+ plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes with suppressed H2 evolution. These findings pave the way for the development of commercially viable, high&#8208;performance ZBFBs for energy storage applications.

         <title>Cyclic Trinuclear Units Based Covalent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three copper cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) bearing affinity functional groups are prepared. It has been demonstrated that the integration of multiple adsorption strategies into porous adsorbents, including adsorption, chemical reduction, and photocatalytic reduction can boost the overall performance of gold recovery.








Abstract
The development of porous solids for gold recovery is highly desired from both an economical and environmental point of view; however, the design of solid adsorbents with high overall performance is still challenging. Herein, we designed three copper(I) cyclic trinuclear units, Cu(I)&#8208;CTUs, based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) by networking metal clusters with dynamic covalent linkages. These CMOFs deliver a high gold adsorption capacity of 3687&#160;mg g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;fast adsorption kinetics (i.e., removal efficiency&#160;&gt;&#160;99% within&#160;20&#160;s), excellent selectivity and reusability. In addition, they can be readily used for gold extraction from e&#8208;waste. Owing to the rich redox properties of Cu&#8208;CTUs, these CMOFs show three sorption mechanisms including adsorption, chemical reduction and photocatalytic reduction. Interestingly, the gold&#8208;loaded CMOFs can be used as catalysts for hydration of alkynes to ketones with high yields (e.g., up to &#8764; 95% for 6 examples).

         <title>Integrative Lattice and Surface Engineering of Nanoscale Fe0 for Superior Dechlorination of Trichloroethene in Groundwater: Coordination in Reactivity, Selectivity, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice and surface engineering strategy was employed to synthesize a novel core&#8208;shell nanomaterial for superior reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene. In this design, FeNi serves as the core and FeS as the shell. Core composition and shell properties interactively determine materials&#8217; performance, and the optimal material exhibited 242.7&#8208;fold higher reactivity and 81.2&#8208;fold greater selectivity compared to the unmodified counterpart.








Abstract
Nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nFe0) materials hold great promise in environmental remediation, yet achieving high reactivity, selectivity, and stability in reduction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we address this challenge by employing Ni lattice and FeS surface engineering to fabricate novel nFe0&#8208;based nanomaterials (dubbed as FeNix@FeSy), featuring FeNi as the core and FeS as the shell. The FeNi5@FeS10 delivered approximately 242.7&#8208; and 81.2&#8208;times higher reactivity and selectivity, respectively, over unmodified nFe&#176; for the remediation of trichloroethene (TCE; a notorious environmental pollutant), while maintaining high stability in groundwater remediation. We found that the core composition (i.e., Ni/Fe ratio) of FeNix@FeSy primarily determined reactivity, governed by a tradeoff between the galvanic effect and lattice strain, while shell properties mainly controlled selectivity, despite some interactions between them. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the FeS surface served as a favorable adsorption site for TCE, and the low energy barriers (TS2, 0.19&#160;eV) of FeNi5@FeS10 facilitated the cleavage of the first chlorine from TCE. Moreover, the core&#8208;shell structure promoted electron transfer from the core to the shell and TCE. This integrative lattice and surface engineering strategy provides a new avenue for designing advanced functional materials for environmental remediation and beyond.

         <title>On&#8208;Membrane Supramolecular Assemblies Serving as Bioorthogonal Gating for Melphalan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent drugs have experienced a revival for anticancer therapies. The balance among selectivity, reactivity, and potency is indispensable for safe and effective drugs. On&#8208;membrane assemblies synergize a bioorthogonal cleavage reaction to regulate the influx of a classical covalent inhibitor, Melphalan, confirming that targeted Ebioorthogonal prodrugs confer cell selectivity to covalent inhibitors without compromising the reactivity and potency.








Abstract
Covalent drugs have experienced a revival in recent decades due to their advantageous pharmacodynamic profiles and targeting of &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins. However, balancing selectivity, reactivity, and potency is essential for safe and effective drugs. Here, we employ a cell&#8208;selective bioorthogonal prodrug design to enhance the selectivity for covalent inhibitors without compromising the reactivity and potency. The upregulation of phosphatase and integrin facilitates the formation of enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular assemblies (EISA) on the cancer cell membrane. These assemblies localize bioorthogonal reaction handles tetrazine (Tz), which liberate Melphalan from its bioorthogonal prodrug TCO&#8208;Mel. The TCO modification disrupts the LAT1&#8208;mediated transportation, reducing cellular permeability of TCO&#8208;Mel and the corresponding cytotoxicity to normal cells. Although the cell&#8208;selective on&#8208;membrane assemblies directed prodrug activation restores Melphalan influx to inhibit cancer cell growth. This prodrug activation strategy further demonstrates potent tumor suppression with satisfactory biocompatibility in vivo. Overall, we extend the scope of bioorthogonal prodrug design for covalent drugs via regulating cellular influx of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

A Cu&#8208;OHDDQP 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) was synthesized possessing a unique quasi&#8208;honeycomb topology, from a pyrazine&#8208;fused, D2&#8208;symmetric ligand. The achieved 2D c&#8208;MOF electrode displayed a remarkable gravimetric capacitance up to 452 A g&#8722;1 for electrochemical lithium storage. Supported by theory and the spectroscopic experiments, the role of the backbone&#8208;embedded pyrazine moieties is unveiled, showing they can offer extra sites for both lithium adsorption and pseudocapacitive charge storage.








Abstract
As a unique class of framework electronic materials, 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) exhibit intrinsic porosity, superior electrical conductivity, and abundant active sites. These properties endow them with great potential in electrochemical lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the development of 2D c&#8208;MOF&#8208;based capacitors has encountered a bottleneck in enhancing Li&#8208;ion storage capacitance, and the design of high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrode materials has remained a challenge. Herein, we synthesize a Cu&#8208;OHDDQP (octahydroxy&#8208;dibenzo[a,c]dibenzo[5,6:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]phenazine) 2D c&#8208;MOF with a quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice by employing a nonplanar D2&#8208;symmetric conjugated ligand embedding redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties. The quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice features a dual&#8208;porous tessellation of C6&#8208;symmetric and C3&#8208;symmetric pores. Notably, when utilized as active material for electrochemical lithium storage, Cu&#8208;OHDDQP achieves a record&#8208;high gravimetric specific capacitance among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs of 452 F g&#8722;1 in aqueous lithium electrolyte,&#160;along with a decent cycling stability of 90% after 1000 cycles. Such high capacitance is attributed to both the quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice leading to higher surface area and the redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties offering extra lithium&#8208;adsorption sites and associated pseudocapacitance. This work demonstrates that rational ligand design enables high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrodes materials, highlighting the potential of conductive MOFs for electrochemical energy technologies.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Functional Polyacetals via Controlled Cascade Enyne Metathesis Polymerization: Tunable Degradability, Postpolymerization Modification, and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a versatile platform to access functional polyacetals from stereochemically defined monomers. The polymerization exhibited living character and broad functional group tolerance. Rational monomer design enabled tunable hydrolysis rate and photodegradability. Polymer structures were elaborated by postpolymerization modification, preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers and amphiphilic copolymers capable of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We present a versatile platform for the synthesis of functional polyacetals from sugar and furfuryl alcohol derivatives using controlled cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. A range of monomers with defined stereochemistry were explored that featured broad functional group tolerance. The polymerization showed living character and permitted preparation of functionalized polyacetals with targetable molecular weights and more complex architectures. In addition, by harnessing the chiral nature of starting materials, the method granted facile access to chiral polyacetals. Modulation of regiochemical and substituent factors around the acetal motif conferred tunable hydrolysis rate, as well as photodegradability when installed with an ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl group. The polymer structure was further elaborated by postpolymerization modification via leveraging the reactivity of suitable pendent groups and preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers via graft&#8208;through polymerization. Further utilities of the method were showcased by the preparation of amphiphilic copolymers with complete degradability that exhibited self&#8208;assembly behaviors through copolymerization.

         <title>Chiroptical Signal Inversion of Peptido&#8208;Coassemblies in Confined Parallel&#8208;Laminar Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous parallel&#8208;laminar microfluidic strategy enables precise control over the chiroptical signals of peptide&#8208;based co&#8208;assemblies. The confined flow environment manipulates non&#8208;covalent interactions, achieving chiral signal inversion compared to conventional methods. This work presents a novel approach for supramolecular chirality regulation and dynamic chiral material design.








Abstract
Chirality plays a vital role in material properties, and precise control of chiral signals is key to designing functional materials. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly offers an efficient means to integrate chiral building blocks with chromophores, yet controlling the assembly pathway remains challenging due to the complexity of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Here, we introduce a continuous parallel&#8208;laminar&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy that exploits solvent ordering and solute diffusion in confined environments to regulate chiral signals in multi&#8208;component peptide co&#8208;assemblies. Notably, six nonpolar amino acids exhibit significantly enhanced chiroptical responses, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. Intriguingly, Fmoc&#8208;Ala and 1&#8208;aminopyrene (AP) co&#8208;assemblies formed in a microfluidic chip show a reversed chiroptical signal compared to those from batch reactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and COMSOL modeling suggest that velocity gradients and shear forces in microfluidics induce ordered non&#8208;covalent interactions, altering excimer stacking and modulating chiroptical properties. This study presents an effective strategy for controlling chiral optical signals in confined environments, offering an interesting approach for supramolecular chiral transfer and regulation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Arylative Dearomatization of Naphthols and Phenols for Constructing Quinazoline&#8208;Containing Spirocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional quinazoline&#8208;containing spiro&#8208;cyclohexadienone through palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylative dearomatization is reported. This transformation demonstrated a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The antiproliferative activity against hematological malignancy cell lines is evaluated, demonstrating that (S)&#8208;4ac is a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.








Abstract
We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylative dearomatization of phenols and naphthols, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. This approach enables the efficient construction of a diverse library of quinazoline&#8208;containing spirocyclic compounds, featuring enantioenriched, three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures through the strategic integration of quinazolinone and spirocyclic frameworks. The successful transformation of planar aromatic precursors into complex three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures using our developed methodology was further validated by principal moment of inertia (PMI) calculations. Additionally, we systematically evaluated the antiproliferative potential of the synthesized compounds against two representative cancer cell lines: Mino (human mantle cell lymphoma) and MV4&#8208;11 (human acute myeloid leukemia), revealing that compound (S)&#8208;4ac, characterized by well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and structural novelty, exhibited significantly enhanced antiproliferative efficacy against both cancer cell lines, with IC50 values 0.9&#160;&#181;M and 0.5&#160;&#181;M, respectively. In addition, flow cytometry quantification and western blot analysis showed that these compounds induced apoptosis through caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results demonstrated (S)&#8208;4ac as a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.

         <title>In Situ &#8220;Confocal&#8221; Electrochemiluminescence 3D Imaging: From Cell to Tissue Section</title>

         <dc:description>
An in situ &#8220;confocal&#8221; electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging method with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) resolution was developed by in situ regulating the homogeneous reaction fluxes on electrode interface, in which the axial position of the ECL focal plane can be regulated from 0 to 63&#160;&#181;m, and even extends to 400&#160;&#181;m. The spatial imaging capability of the 3D ECL imaging method has been validated by the ECL sectioning imaging the topographies of single cells, cell clusters, and tissue sections.








Abstract
Endowing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technique with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) resolution to investigate specimens at varying axial depths poses a challenging yet significant objective. Herein, a &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was developed using luminol as ECL probe, in which excited luminophore was formed in the vicinity of electrode surface through homogeneous chemical reactions between oppositely diffusing ECL precursors, luminol diazaquinone intermediate (L), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), confining the ECL emission in a thin plane (ECL focal plane) parallel to electrode surface at their intersection. The regulating ability of electrochemical method on the reaction fluxes of L and H2O2 was validated, regulating the axial location of the ECL focal plane from 0 to 63 &#181;m, which can even extend to 400 &#181;m by using the stable coreactant of ClO&#8722;. Leveraging the optical sectioning capability of the ECL focal plane, the &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was applied to bioimaging, from cells to tissue sections. It revealed cellular morphology changes during cell polarity establishment and the heterogeneous distribution of complex tubule structure in kidney tissue sections. The optical sectioning capability of &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging makes it a powerful tool for studying complex biological samples.

         <title>A Carboxylate&#8208;based Hydrophilic Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with a Large Molecular Dipole Moment for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ester hydrolysis to remove the side chain, a carboxylate&#8208;functionalized hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7&#8208;Th, was obtained. The carboxylates significantly amplify the molecular dipole moment, creating a giant built&#8208;in electric field within the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction photocatalyst. This facilitates ultrafast exciton dissociation and efficient charge transport, thereby enhancing hydrogen evolution activity and stability.








Abstract
Achieving ultrafast dissociation of photogenerated excitons and efficient charge transport within the photocatalyst is a fundamental issue. Additionally, enhancing the interaction between semiconductors and water is crucial for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we synthesized a carboxylate&#8208;based hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7&#8208;Th. Exposed carboxylates enhance semiconductor&#8208;water interfacial compatibility, reducing contact resistance and accelerating charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, the carboxylate substitution shifts polarity centers, amplifying the molecular dipole moment by 10&#8208;fold. This induces a giant built&#8208;in electric field, enabling ultrafast electron&#8208;transfer process (ca. 0.31 ps) in the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction. Consequently, the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM&#8208;based bulk heterojunction nanoparticles exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 111.5 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, four times over the ester&#8208;based counterpart (PTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM). Moreover, the electrostatic stability imparted by the carboxylates endows hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM with outstanding operational stability, maintaining 81% of its initial hydrogen evolution rate after 100&#160;h operation. This result places it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction photocatalysts in terms of stability. This work establishes a molecular engineering strategy for high&#8208;performance bulk heterojunction photocatalysts, emphasizing synergistic optimization of hydrophilicity, dipole engineering, and interfacial dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;Through ester hydrolysis to remove the side chain, a carboxylate-functionalized hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7-Th, was obtained. The carboxylates significantly amplify the molecular dipole moment, creating a giant built-in electric field within the hPTB7-Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction photocatalyst. This facilitates ultrafast exciton dissociation and efficient charge transport, thereby enhancing hydrogen evolution activity and stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving ultrafast dissociation of photogenerated excitons and efficient charge transport within the photocatalyst is a fundamental issue. Additionally, enhancing the interaction between semiconductors and water is crucial for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we synthesized a carboxylate-based hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7-Th. Exposed carboxylates enhance semiconductor-water interfacial compatibility, reducing contact resistance and accelerating charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, the carboxylate substitution shifts polarity centers, amplifying the molecular dipole moment by 10-fold. This induces a giant built-in electric field, enabling ultrafast electron-transfer process (ca. 0.31 ps) in the hPTB7-Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction. Consequently, the hPTB7-Th:PCBM-based bulk heterojunction nanoparticles exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 111.5 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, four times over the ester-based counterpart (PTB7-Th:PCBM). Moreover, the electrostatic stability imparted by the carboxylates endows hPTB7-Th:PCBM with outstanding operational stability, maintaining 81% of its initial hydrogen evolution rate after 100&#160;h operation.

         <title>Bayesian Meta&#8208;Learning for Few&#8208;Shot Reaction Outcome Prediction of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian meta&#8208;learning framework is proposed for reaction outcome prediction in low&#8208;data settings. It utilizes a literature&#8208;mined dataset on asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins to build a pre&#8208;trained model. This meta&#8208;model is shown to return better predictions as compared to single&#8208;tasks methods, such as random forest and graph neural networks, given minimal training data.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the increasing application of machine learning (ML) in chemical reaction development. These ML methods, in general, require huge training set examples. The published literature has large amounts of data, but there are modelling challenges due to the sparse nature of these datasets. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;learning workflow that can utilize the literature&#8208;mined data and return accurate predictions with limited data. A literature dataset comprising of over 12&#160;000 transition metal catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins (AHO) is chosen to demonstrate the utility of our protocol. A meta&#8208;model is trained in a binary classification setting to identify highly enantioselective AHO reactions. Two Bayesian meta&#8208;learning approaches are considered, namely, deep kernel transfer (DKT) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF). Both these methods returned better predictions compared to prototypical network, which is another popular meta&#8208;learning approach. Single&#8208;task methods, such as random forest, graph neural network, and deep kernel learning, performed worse than meta&#8208;learning methods even when trained on full training data. Additionally, we propose another meta&#8208;learning approach called ADKF&#8208;prior that is shown to further improve the performance in low&#8208;data settings. The generalizability of our meta&#8208;model is also evaluated on substrate&#8208; and time&#8208;based splits. Our meta&#8208;learning workflow can be utilized to build a pretrained meta&#8208;model for any reaction of interest, which can then be useful to predict the outcome of new but related reactions in a few&#8208;shot manners.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron and Oxygen Coordination on Ruthenium Clusters for Industrial Water Splitting in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density boron&#8211;oxygen bi&#8208;coordinated ruthenium clusters have been successfully synthesized. The resultant RuC&#8211;B&#8211;O/rGO composites exhibit promising potential for application in industrial water electrolysis.








Abstract
The alteration in the coordination environment of metal atoms can manipulate their electronic structure and regulate the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. In this work, synchrotron radiation tests prove that the boron (B) and oxygen (O) elements co&#8208;coordinate with ruthenium clusters (RuC) on the surface of B&#8211;O modified reduced graphene oxide. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that this unique structure electrocatalyst presents an overpotential of 12&#160;mV in 1&#160;M KOH condition and for over 120&#160;h at the current of &#8722;1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating potential practical applications. The quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the B&#8211;O diatomic coordination can modulate the synergy between the substrate and the RuC catalytic site, enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity and ion migration efficiency. The first principles calculation further proves that B&#8211;O diatomic coordination will reduce the desorption barrier of H* and construct a complete hydrogen migration path. This study discloses the significance of the synergistic effect of two anions to enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst by altering the coordination environment of ruthenium clusters.

         <title>Hyperpolarization Modulation of the T&#8208;Type hCav3.2 Channel by Human Synenkephalin [1&#8211;53], a Shrew Neurotoxin Analogue without Paralytic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human synenkephalin [1&#8211;53] (hSYN), an analogue peptide of shrew saliva neurotoxins, was synthesized and its structural characteristics studied. Synthetic hSYN potently activated the T&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated Ca channel hCav3.2 but did not paralyze mealworms. These findings offer new insight into neurological disorder treatment and evolutionary mechanisms of venom peptides in mammals.








Abstract
Mammalian secreted venoms mainly consist of peptides and proteases used for defense or predation. Blarina paralytic peptides (BPPs), mealworm&#8208;targeting neurotoxins from shrew, are very similar to human synenkephalin. This peptide is released from proenkephalin in the brain along with opioid peptides that mediate analgesic and antidepressant effects, though its physiological function is unclear. Here, we synthesized and characterized human synenkephalin [1&#8211;53] (hSYN) and reveal its disulfide bond connectivity. Similar to BPP2, hSYN caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the human T&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated calcium channel (hCav3.2) at 0.74&#160;&#181;M, but did not paralyze mealworms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that hSYN and BPP2 interact with hCav3.2 channel differently, due to differences in polar residues. Since Cav3.2 channel regulates neuronal excitability and is implicated in conditions like autism and epilepsy, our findings on hSYN could provide insight into the channel gating and agonistic mechanisms, along with potential pathways for developing treatments for neurological disorders.

         <title>Metathetical Exchange, Synthesis, and Carbon Dioxide Addition of Higher Homologues of Group 9 Metal Carbynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy carbynes of Group 9 metals is presented. Furthermore, in a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride.








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy homologues of Group 9 metal carbynes [(Me3P)3Co&#8801;GeAr*] (1), [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;GeAr*] (2), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;GeAr*] (3), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;SnAr*] (5), and [(Et3P)3Ir&#8801;PbAr*] (7) is presented [Ar* = C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(Trip)2, Trip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3]. During these preparations, the tetrylidynes [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;SnAr*] (4), and [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;PbAr*] (6), were also prepared in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. These metathesis reactions were tracked by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]&#8208;fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar&#160;=&#160;Ar*, Tbb). Reactions of the tetrylidynes (2&#8211;5) with carbon dioxide yield the products of a redox reaction [(Me3P)3(CO)M&#8208;E(&#951;2&#8208;O2CO&#8208;&#954;2O)Ar*] [E&#160;=&#160;Ge, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (11); M&#160;=&#160;Ir (12); E&#160;=&#160;Sn, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (14), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (16)] with a carbon monoxide coordinated at the transition metal and a carbonate coordinated at the Group 14 element.

         <title>Engineering Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Selective Acid Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of bipolar covalent organic framework membranes with tunable charge distributions is fabricated, demonstrating a significant rectification effect and an internal electric field. These features promote the translocation of NO3&#8722;, which has a low valence and dispersed charge density, resulting in a higher transmembrane diffusion coefficient than its self&#8208;diffusion rate. This enhances the selective extraction of NO3&#8722; from mixed waste.








Abstract
Nitric acid (HNO3) is a vital industrial chemical, and its recovery from complex waste streams is essential for sustainability and resource optimization. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of bipolar covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ionic site distributions as a solution for this challenge. The membranes are fabricated by layering anionic COF nanosheets on cationic COF layers, supported by a porous substrate. The resulting membranes exhibit significant rectifying behavior, driven by the asymmetric charge polarity and the intrinsic electric field, which enhances HNO3 transport. The transmembrane diffusion coefficient of 2.74&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1 exceeds the self&#8208;diffusion rate of NO3&#8722;, leading to increased HNO3 flux and selectivity compared to the individual anionic and cationic COF membranes. The optimized bipolar membrane configuration achieves remarkable separation factors, ranging from 22 to 242,000 for HNO&#8323;, in comparison to other solutes such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, and various metal salts in an eight&#8208;component mixed waste stream. This results in a substantial increase in HNO&#8323; purity, from 12.5% to 94.1% after a single membrane separation. With the broad range of COF materials and the versatility of the proposed membrane design, this work represents a significant advancement in chemical separation technologies.

         <title>Nitrate Reduction for Deaminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a one&#8208;step deaminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling of anilines via fleeting diazonium intermediate with nitrate and bisulfite as the reagents. This represents the first application of the nitrate reduction strategy in transition metal catalysis of diazonium chemistry. The reaction utilizes low&#8208;hazard, readily available starting materials and reagents. Our method demonstrates a simpler and safer procedure, together with the advantage of functional group tolerance and potential application in the arylation of various aniline&#8208;containing complex molecules.








Abstract
We present a deaminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling (SMC) of anilines with nitrate as a diazotization reagent, which integrates transition&#8208;metal catalysis with nitrate&#8208;based diazonium chemistry for the first time. The synergistic reduction of nitrate by bisulfite and boronic acids allows for both oxidative diazotization with low&#8208;valent transition metal redox transformations simultaneously. The reaction utilizes low&#8208;hazard, readily available starting materials and reagents. In comparison to previous diazonium&#8208;based Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;couplings, the in situ oxidation of anilines by reduction of nitrate allows larger functional group tolerance.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones Enabled by a Carboxylic Acid Additive Promotion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to ligand acceleration and substrate direction strategies, this work introduces a third method to improve the efficiency of asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation, namely additive promotion. The carboxylic acid additive not only improves the reductive activity of the carbonyl group on the substrate but also improves the coordination of the hydroxyl group on the substrate and optimizes the stereocontrol environment of the key transition state so as to realize the highly efficient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl ketones.








Abstract
Highly enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones was achieved by applying the catalytic combination of cobalt acetate and chiral Ph&#8208;BPE ligand, supplemented by a carboxylic acid additive promotion strategy. The carboxylic acid additive significantly increases both reactivity and enantioselectivity, allowing for the highly efficient generation of chiral 1,2&#8208;diols with up to 99% ee. The application utility is proved through derivations and a total synthesis of (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;eliprodil. Mechanistic studies, including control experiments and DFT calculations, support the proposed catalytic mechanism and explain the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Phosphorescent Iridium(III) Phenanthrolinedione Complexes as Lifetime&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Probes for Wash&#8208;Free Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging of Cellular Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes exhibiting sensitive phosphorescence responses, particularly lifetime changes, to bioorthogonal reactions with &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone&#8208;modified biomolecules. These complexes enabled wash&#8208;free, time&#8208;resolved bioimaging of bioorthogonal labeling in living cells. The lifetime&#8208;based readout provides multi&#8208;dimensional data, facilitating spatiotemporal monitoring of the labeling process.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;We report a series of iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes exhibiting sensitive phosphorescence responses, particularly lifetime changes, to bioorthogonal reactions with &#945;-angelica lactone-modified biomolecules. These complexes enabled wash-free, time-resolved bioimaging of bioorthogonal labeling in living cells. The lifetime-based readout provides multi-dimensional data, facilitating spatiotemporal monitoring of the labeling process.

         <title>De Novo Design of Structure&#8208;Tunable Multivalent Targeting Chimeras for Tumor&#8208;Targeted PD&#8208;L1 Degradation and Potentiated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi&#8208;TACs) was presented for tumor&#8208;specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on the surface of the tumor cell membrane. The multi&#8208;TACs were synthesized by copolymerization of PD&#8208;L1 inhibitor BMS&#8208;1 with various acid&#8208;responsive monomers. The multi&#8208;TACs with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme&#8208;sensitivity highly efficiently abolished PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology holds significant potential for modulating protein homeostasis and treating diseases. However, current methods for degrading membrane proteins highly depend on the lysosome&#8208;targeting ligands or membrane receptors. In this study, we present a set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi&#8208;TACs) for tumor&#8208;specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on the surface of the tumor cell membrane. The multi&#8208;TACs are synthesized by copolymerization of small&#8208;molecule PD&#8208;L1 inhibitor BMS&#8208;1 with acid&#8208;responsive monomers. The chemical structures of the multi&#8208;TACs are optimized by investigating the correlation between PD&#8208;L1 degradation efficacy and the key parameters, including acid&#8208;sensitive moieties, BMS&#8208;1 valency, and spacer length. Mechanistic study reveals that the multi&#8208;TACs highly efficiently degrade PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways, which differ from the reported strategies for membrane protein degradation. The outperformed multi&#8208;TAC GG56 with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme&#8208;sensitivity dramatically reduces PD&#8208;L1 levels and suppresses tumor growth in mouse models of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast tumors. Furthermore, GG56 serves as a versatile nanoplatform for combinatory chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and radio&#8208;immunotherapy of 4T1 breast tumor by co&#8208;delivery of chemotherapeutic and radio&#8208;sensitizer, respectively.

         <title>Decoupled MOF Breathing: Pressure&#8208;Induced Reversal of Correlation Between Orthogonal Motions in a Diamondoid Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;62 exhibits &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions affecting the cross&#8208;section and length of its 1D pores. Application of pressure reveals that the two motions can be switched between positive correlation and negative correlation, demonstrating decoupling of these motions within the 3D framework and providing a platform for design of more complex dynamic responsive materials.








Abstract
Responsive porous materials can outperform more rigid analogues in applications requiring precise triggering of molecular uptake/release, switching or gradual change in properties. We have uncovered an unprecedented dynamic response in the diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;62, (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)2] (BDC&#160;=&#160;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), by using pressure as a stimulus. SHF&#8208;62 exhibits two distinct framework &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions involving changes in 1) cross&#8208;section and 2) length of its 1D pores. Our study using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in sapphire&#8208;capillary (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.15&#160;GPa) and diamond&#8208;anvil (0.15&#160;&lt;&#160;p &lt; 5&#160;GPa) cells reveals that different pressure regimes trigger positive and negative correlation between these two motions, requiring an unprecedented mechanical decoupling. Specifically, the DMF&#8208;solvated framework SHF&#8208;62&#8208;DMF, in DMF as pressure&#8208;transmitting medium, undergoes initial hyperexpansion of pore cross&#8208;section (p&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa), due to DMF ingress, followed by reversal/reduction at p&#160;&gt;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa while pore length contracts for all pressure increases, revealing decoupling of the two framework deformations. By contrast, nonpenetrating medium FC&#8208;70 imposes correlated compression (p&#160;&lt;&#160;1.4&#160;GPa) of pore cross&#8208;section and length, resembling framework activation/desolvation motions but of greater magnitude. Similar behavior occurs for SHF&#8208;62&#8208;CHCl3 in CHCl3 (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.14&#160;GPa), suggesting minimal ingress of CHCl3. These findings change our understanding of MOF dynamic responses and provide a platform for future responsive materials development.

         <title>Nanochanneling and Local Crystallization Engineering Accelerate Multiphase Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for Rapid Water Decontamination</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystallinity engineering is applied to carbon microspheres for fabricating transition metal single atoms confined in hydrophilic graphitic nanochannels by precisely etching the amorphous carbon realm. This fine&#8208;tuned nanoenvironment enhances tri&#8208;phase mass transfer and optimizes O3 nonradical activation thermodynamics by inducing the bidental &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; O3 adsorption, which reduces O3 activation barrier and accelerates reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Precise engineering of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with optimal hierarchical structures and favorable local chemical environments remains a significant challenge to cater for multiphase heterogeneous processes. Here, we develop a universal strategy for synthesizing channel&#8208;digging microspherical SACs that markedly enhance gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid mass transfer and fine&#8208;tune the thermodynamics of catalytic ozonation. By catalytically graphitizing carbon microspheres and selectively etching amorphous carbon domains via mild combustion, we fabricate cross&#8208;linked hierarchical graphitic nanochannels confining transition metal (e.g., Co, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) single atoms (TMCSs&#8208;Air). This nanoenvironment engineering increases interfacial ozone (O3) mass transfer by 3.2&#8208;fold and directs O3 adsorption from a conventional &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a bidental &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. The enhanced inter&#8208;orbital electronic interactions lower the O3 activation barrier and form highly oxidizing surface&#8208;confined O3 (*O3). Consequently, the CoCSs&#8208;Air catalyst achieves a 3.6&#8208;fold higher ozone utilization efficiency and a 4.2&#8208;fold greater turnover frequency (TOF&#160;=&#160;1580&#160;min&#8722;1) compared with pristine Co&#8208;doped carbon microspheres (CoCSs). Technical and economic evaluations further confirm the feasibility of TMCSs&#8208;Air nanoreactors in treating real&#8208;world petrochemical wastewater, highlighting its broader potential in overcoming gas diffusion barriers and tuning reaction pathways for multiphase heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>An Artificial Metal&#8208;Free Peroxidase Designed Using a Ferritin Cage for Bioinspired Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing artificial enzymes remains challenging due to the need for precise active site control. Here, we present a simple strategy to create metal&#8208;free artificial enzymes by engineering Histidine clusters inside a ferritin cage. The resulting catalyst mimics peroxidase activity, and its stable cage structure offers new insights into supramolecular catalysis, opening avenues for bioinspired catalyst development. 








Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes is challenging because it requires precise design of active sites with well&#8208;arranged amino acid residues. Histidine&#8208;rich oligopeptides have been recently shown to exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities, but their catalytic function relies on maintaining unique supramolecular structures. This work demonstrates the design of a specific array of histidine residues on the internal surface of the ferritin cage to function as an active center for catalysis. The crystal structures of the ferritin mutants revealed histidine&#8211;histidine interactions, forming well&#8208;defined histidine clusters (His&#8208;clusters). These mutants exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities by oxidizing 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Molecular dynamics simulations further highlight the co&#8208;localization of TMB and hydrogen peroxide at the histidine&#8208;rich clusters, indicating that the confined environment of the ferritin cage enhances their interactions. This study presents a simple yet effective approach to design metal&#8208;free artificial enzymes, paving the way for innovations in bioinspired catalysis.

         <title>Oscillatory Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Pd/TiO2 Under Redox Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oscillatory strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) behavior of Pd/TiO2 nanocatalysts under redox conditions was revealed through environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM). The oscillatory TiOx overlayers act as a temporary reservoir for Ti species, facilitating the tip growth of the support protrusion.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis, with its encapsulation configuration being highly dependent on the chemical environments. However, the dynamic behavior of SMSI under redox conditions remains insufficiently understood. Here, environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) revealed that SMSI overlayers form stably on the surface of Pd/TiO2 nanocatalysts under pure O2 and pure H2 conditions, and exhibit oscillatory behavior under a redox condition with a 5:1 O2/H2 ratio at 0.05&#160;Pa. Specifically, the outer layer of the SMSI overlayer, characterized primarily by typical oxidative SMSI, undergoes oscillations between formation and retraction near the Pd&#8208;TiO2 interface. The SMSI oscillations locally modify the morphology of the TiO2 support, with the SMSI overlayer serving as a temporary reservoir for Ti species to drive the tip growth of the support protrusion. Our work expands the understanding of the dynamic behavior of SMSI under reaction conditions and provides new insights into the solid&#8208;state growth mechanism.

         <title>Triple Synergy Engineering via Metal&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Atom Incorporation for Self&#8208;Sustaining Acidic Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a metal&#8208;free heteronuclear catalyst, Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC, engineering atomic&#8208;level triple synergy: 1) Electron&#8208;deficient Ni&#948;&#8314; and oxygen vacancies boost nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion activity while suppressing H2 evolution. 2) Iodine&#8208;mediated proton reservoirs dynamically regulate H* coverage. 3) Covalent Si&#9472;O&#9472;Ni bonding stabilizes the interface. The catalyst achieves a 96.8% FE and groundbreaking 420&#8208;h durability in acid. The innovative heteronuclear diatomic synergistic strategy establishes a new design principle for durable, acid&#8208;compatible electrocatalysts of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) for ammonia synthesis under acidic conditions offers significant advantages, like direct fertilizer production and prevention of ammonia volatilization. However, three critical challenges persist: instability of metal&#8208;based catalysts, competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and proton depletion leading to species imbalance. Here, we developed a novel metal&#8208;free heteronuclear diatomic&#8208;based catalyst that simultaneously addresses these challenges through atomic&#8208;level triple synergy engineering. Silicon&#8211;iodine dual&#8208;atoms are precisely anchored on nickel oxide ultrathin nanosheets supported on carbon cloth (Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC) via a gradient&#8208;heating co&#8208;loading method. Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC establishes a self&#8208;sustaining catalytic system, achieving a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE and record&#8208;breaking operational stability of 420&#160;h in acidic electrolyte, surpassing the performance of all reported acid NO3RR electrocatalysts to date. Advanced in situ spectroscopic characterization combined with electrochemical evaluation reveals the triple synergy mechanism: electron&#8208;deficient Ni&#948;&#8314; and oxygen vacancies generate abundant active sites while mitigating HER competition, iodine&#8208;mediated proton reservoirs dynamically regulate H* coverage to maintain species balance, and covalent Si&#9472;O&#9472;Ni interfacial bonding inhibits metal leaching and stabilizes the catalytic system. This work establishes a constructive guideline for the rational engineering of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for selective acidic NO3RR.

         <title>Benzotrifuran&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2 from H2O, O2, and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three benzotrifuran&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks were constructed. The COF&#8208;JLU90 with hydrazone linkage achieves efficient H2O2 photocatalysis with an average mass rate of up to 9800&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from H2O and O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight by balancing O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important green chemical and a potential energy carrier. Artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 from only H2O and O2 under sunlight is a fascinating and sustainable tactic. However, deficient proton sources come from the kinetically sluggish H2O oxidation process (&#8764;s) seriously impede half&#8208;reaction of O2 reduction (&#181;s&#8764;ms), leading to inferior photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we prepare a benzotrifuran&#8208;based covalent organic framework featuring electron donor&#8211;acceptor character with hydrazone linkage. Spatially separated donor&#8211;acceptor &#960;&#8208;stacking columns offer rich O2 reduction and H2O oxidation active sites, also serve as channels for photoinduced charge separation and transport. Importantly, the 1D pore containing abundant heteroatoms facilitates H2O delivery to oxidation sites and reduces reaction energy barrier, thus improving the kinetic of H2O oxidation. Accordingly, this porous framework achieves efficient H2O2 photocatalysis with an average mass rate of up to 9800&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from H2O and O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight by balancing O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions.

         <title>Photodriven Aquatic Locomotion in Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Composites with Tunable Wettability</title>

Thiol&#8208;functionalized MXene integrated into liquid crystal elastomers enables uniform dispersion, enhanced photothermal response, and tunable wettability through superwettable coatings. These properties facilitate light&#8208;induced actuation for advanced soft robotics both at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater.








Abstract
Photodriven liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) composites with thiol&#8208;functionalized Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx MXene nanosheets are introduced as a versatile material system for achieving controlled aquatic locomotion. By incorporating superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic coatings, these composites demonstrate distinct modalities at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the LCE nanocomposites is enhanced through the homogeneous dispersion of MXene platelets within the LCE matrix, facilitated by thiol&#8208;functionalization. Superhydrophobic coatings increase buoyancy and reduce drag, enabling locomotion akin to water striders at the air&#8211;water interface. Conversely, superhydrophilic coatings submerse the composites to allow photomechanical actuation to drive underwater locomotion against gravity. By combining tunable wettability with robust photothermal performance, these MXene&#8208;LCE composites open new opportunities for designing and integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in aquatic actuation systems.

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atomic Hybrid Glasses for Near&#8208;Infrared II Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of transparent metal&#8211;organic complex glasses has been synthesized through a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly process that enables facile doping of lanthanide ions. By leveraging the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) sensitized lanthanide strategy, these glasses exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield and efficient optical waveguiding in the NIR region, thus offering potential advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.








Abstract
The increasing demands for modern information communication and storage necessitate the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active optical waveguides. However, achieving efficient NIR emission with minimal optical loss remains a critical challenge. Herein, we present a new class of rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses, synthesized via bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, as a solution to these limitations. By harnessing the ultralong phosphorescence of Nd3+&#8208;doped complex glasses, these materials achieve NIR&#8208;II emission extending to 1.32&#160;&#181;m with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8764;5.7%, setting a new record among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based complexes in the NIR&#8208;II region. This exceptional performance stems from the efficient sensitization of Nd3+ ions in hybrid glass, with a phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency of 93.55%. Furthermore, these transparent and flexible hybrid glasses trigger optical waveguiding in Eu3+&#8208; and Nd3+&#8208;doped microstructures, enabling ultralow&#8208;loss coefficients of 0.978&#160;dB mm&#8722;1 at 819&#160;nm and 5.1&#160;dB mm&#8722;1 at 1048&#160;nm, respectively. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates that metal&#8211;organic complex glasses with ultralong phosphorescence can effectively serve as sensitizer matrices for boosting NIR&#8208;II emission, but also supports the fabrication of 1D and 2D glassy microstructures with ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguiding for advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.

         <title>Modular Access to Aliphatic Polycarbonates with Tunable Properties and Dual Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability by Polycondensation&#8211;Depolymerization&#8211;Repolymerization Strategy</title>

We presented a &#8220;polycondensation&#8722;depolymerization&#8722;repolymerization&#8221; strategy for structurally diverse aliphatic polycarbonates. This involved a step growth polycondensation of dialkyl carbonate and diol to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers which are utilized to produce cyclic carbonates through catalytic depolymerization. The subsequent ring&#8208;opening polymerization of cyclic carbonate led to high molecular weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) polycarbonates.








Abstract
Great achievements have been made in CO2/epoxide copolymerization and dialkyl carbonate/diol polycondensation; however, efficient preparation of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) aliphatic polycarbonates with tunable properties and recyclability under mild conditions still remains as a great challenge. Herein, we presented a &#8220;polycondensation&#8211;depolymerization&#8211;repolymerization&#8221; strategy for structurally diverse aliphatic polycarbonates. This involved a step growth polycondensation of dialkyl carbonate and diol to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (0.5&#8722;1.9&#160;kDa) polycarbonates under atmosphere pressure, which are then utilized to produce cyclic carbonate monomers through catalytic depolymerization. The ring&#8208;opening polymerization of cyclic carbonate led to high molecular weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) polymers, which can be converted back to cyclic monomer via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or diol/dialkyl carbonate via alcoholysis, enabling chemical recycling of polycarbonates via dual closed loops. The thermal and mechanical properties of the polycarbonates can be widely adjusted by varying the substituent, and polycarbonate with four&#8208;membered spiro&#8208;cyclic substituent shows a recorded high melting temperature (217&#160;&#176;C) and mechanical strength within the reported polycarbonate family. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. The &#8220;polycondensation&#8722;depolymerization&#8722;repolymerization&#8221; strategy provided a powerful toolbox for developing high&#8208;performance aliphatic polycarbonates.

         <title>Simultaneous Improvement of Mechanical Strength, Toughness, and Self&#8208;healability of Elastomers Enabled by F&#9472;H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Based Nanoconfinement</title>

A biomimetic strategy for simultaneously improving mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healability of elastomers is developed by leveraging F&#9472;H bonds for nanoconfinement to form small and dense nanodomains, resulting in the highest recorded puncture energy and unprecedented fracture energy elastomer thus far.








Abstract
There are often trade&#8208;offs among high mechanical strength, high toughness, and efficient self&#8208;healing. Herein, we present a biomimetic strategy utilizing F&#9472;H bonds for nanoconfinement to achieve the simultaneous enhancement of these conflicting properties. The mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healing efficiency of a fluorinated crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) (CPUU&#8208;FA) elastomer are improved 1.3&#8208;, 1.5&#8208;, and 1.2&#8208;fold, respectively, compared with those of its nonfluorinated counterpart. Notably, the CPUU&#8208;FA has the highest recorded puncture energy (887 mJ) among polymeric elastomers and the highest fracture energy (117&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) among reported thermoset elastomers. Moreover, it exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing efficiency (99%), remarkable reprocessability, and a low surface energy (56&#160;MJ m&#8722;2). The application of self&#8208;healing elastomers in the fabrication of soft electronics is further demonstrated. The molecular design strategy is anticipated to inspire new developments in high&#8208;performance materials for cutting&#8208;edge applications.

         <title>Structural Basis for the Catalytic Mechanism of ATP&#8208;Dependent Diazotase CmaA6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several diazotases have been reported in recent years, but the detailed catalytic mechanism is unclear. From X&#8208;ray crystallography and Cryo&#8208;EM analysis, we obtained the structure of a diazotase CmaA6, which synthesizes 3&#8208;diazocoumaric acid. Kinetic analysis and computational analysis indicated that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via an unprecedented sequential mechanism in which three substrates are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket.








Abstract
Although several diazotases have been recently reported, the details of the reaction mechanism are not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of CmaA6, an ATP&#8208;dependent diazotase, which catalyzes the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid using nitrous acid. X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy&#8208;single particle analysis revealed CmaA6 structures in the substrate&#8208;free and AMP&#8208;binding states. Kinetic analysis suggested that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via a sequential reaction mechanism in which three substrates (nitrous acid, ATP, and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid) are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket. The nitrous acid and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid binding sites were predicted based on the AMP&#8208;binding state and confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. In addition, computational analysis revealed a tunnel for 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid to enter the reaction pocket, which was advantageous for the sequential reaction mechanism. This study provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism of diazotization in natural product biosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Several diazotases have been reported in recent years, but the detailed catalytic mechanism is unclear. From X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM analysis, we obtained the structure of a diazotase CmaA6, which synthesizes 3-diazocoumaric acid. Kinetic analysis and computational analysis indicated that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via an unprecedented sequential mechanism in which three substrates are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket.

         <title>Streamlining SuFEx Inhibitor Development: A Unified Approach Using Photolabile and Orthogonal Sulfinate Protecting Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Study outlines the discovery and selection of sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs) based on their overall stability, ease of synthesis, and simple deprotection conditions, including two novel, photolabile SPGs that can be directly converted to the sulfonyl fluoride (SFs) using light and selectfluor. This streamlined approach to SF synthesis allows for their incorporation at any point in a synthetic endeavor, enabling access to complex SF&#8208;containing small molecules.








Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides (SFs) have gained significant importance due to their classification as a click reaction and therefore have seen increased use in drug discovery and biochemistry. Their use, however, is complicated by the methods by which they are synthesized and their general synthetic instability. This results in SFs being introduced late in a synthetic route with minimal structural diversity. Masking the reactivity of a sulfonyl fluoride by protecting the parent sulfinate is one method to ameliorate these issues. Current sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs), however, possess limited stability. This study outlines the discovery and selection of SPGs based on their overall stability, ease of synthesis, and simple deprotection conditions. This includes the discovery of two novel, photolabile SPGs, para&#8208;methoxybenzyl Rongalite and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl Rongalite that can be directly converted to the sulfonyl fluoride using light and selectfluor. Along with known SPG, 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl sulfone (SES), all three SPGs were found to possess broad stability when exposed to numerous common synthetic conditions and are easily coupled to aryl halides from their sulfinate salt precursor. Their utility is then demonstrated in the synthesis of SPG containing building blocks that are incorporated into several bioactive small molecules.

         <title>Enhancing C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage of Glycerol Electrooxidation Through Spin&#8208;Selective Electron Donation in&#160;Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox Heterostructural Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;spin&#8208;selective electron donation&#8221; strategy effectively modulates the electronic states of Pd's d orbitals (dz2${d_{{z^2}}}$ and dxy) through distinct pathway: &#963;&#8208;donation from low&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g6eg0) and &#960;&#8208;donation from high&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g5eg1).








Abstract
As a 4d transition metal, the spin state of Pd is extremely difficult to directly regulate for the optimized d orbital states owing to the strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect and further extended d orbital. Herein, we devise a &#8220;spin&#8208;selective electron donation&#8221; strategy to tune specific d orbital electrons of Pd inspired by the Dewar&#8722;Chatt&#8722;Duncanson model theory. Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridges with different spin&#8208;states of CoIII have been constructed in a series of Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox HNSs with tunable Co content. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that low&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g6eg0) with fully occupied t2g orbitals and empty dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ orbitals can accurately alter the dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ electron of Pd by &#963;&#8208;donation via the Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridge. In contrast, the unfilled dxy orbital of high&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g5eg1) is essential for controlling the dxy electron of Pd via &#960;&#8208;donation. Benefiting from dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ state optimization by &#963;&#8208;donation, Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Co4.0 delivers superior performance toward various bio&#8208;alcohols (ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol) with enhanced C&#9472;C bond cleavage. Furthermore, coupling the glycerol oxidation reaction with the CO2 reduction reaction (GOR||CO2RR), the electricity consumption of GOR||CO2RR drops 46.4% compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art system (OER||CO2RR). Moreover, anodic Faraday efficiency (FE) of formic acid can be attainable at more than 90% at low voltage regions.

         <title>Enhancing Waste Plastic Hydrogenolysis on Ru/CeO2 Through Concurrent Incorporation of Fe Single Atoms and FeOx Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a high&#8208;performance low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) hydrogenolysis catalyst by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeOx nanoclusters (NCs) on Ru NCs&#8208;decorated CeO2. The interaction between FeOx NCs and Ru NCs enhances Ru&#176; content, thereby optimizing C&#9472;C cleavage kinetics, while Fe SAs act as hydrogen storage to regulate surface hydrogen coverage and suppress cascade hydrogenation, ultimately boosting liquid product yield.








Abstract
Ru&#8208;based catalysts have exhibited significant promise in converting waste plastics into valuable long&#8208;carbon chain products. However, their efficiency is hindered by the uncontrollable cascade hydrogenation, which stems from their exceptional reactivity for C&#9472;C cleavage. Herein, we reported a multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeOx nanoclusters (NCs) by Ru NCs&#8208;decorated CeO2 substrates. This catalyst demonstrates an extraordinary performance, achieving nearly 100% low density polyethylene (LDPE) conversion under the conditions of 250 &#176;C and 2&#160;MPa hydrogen after 1 h, along with remarkably&#8208;improved liquid product selectivity of 86.4% compared to that of bare Ru/CeO2 (59.8%). Through a variety of spectroscopic studies, we revealed the unique interactions between FeOx NCs and Ru NCs, which leads to an increased Ru&#176; content. More significantly, we also confirmed the crucial role of Fe SAs in adsorbing active hydrogen species, thereby increasing the hydrogen coverage. Such precise regulations towards both the intrinsic surface state of Ru and its adjacent chemical environment successfully inhibited the cascade hydrogenation, ultimately resulting in a significant enhancement in the selectivity of liquid products.

         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex, which could restore cell&#8211;cell communication to elicit bystander effect for enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING responses, was constructed. It promoted gap junctional intercellular communication for cGAMP transfer and induced bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, thereby enhancing STING activation and amplifying antitumor immunity. The work provided a new perspective for antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
The activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway has shown promise in enhancing antitumor immunity. However, the pathway involved de novo transcription and translation processes, which delays immune responses. Besides, the rapid clearance of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) by extracellular hydrolase limits its availability, attenuating STING signaling and resulting in insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we constructed a DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex, which could restore cell&#8208;cell communication to elicit bystander effect for enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING responses. By virtue of its capabilities to promote gap junctional intercellular communication for cGAMP transfer and to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells through bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis, the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in tumor cells was activated and amplified in a transcription&#8208;independent, horizontal manner. The nanocomplex presented safe and robust antitumor effects against not only primary tumors but also distant and metastatic tumors via abscopal effects. The work highlighted the effects of restoring cell&#8211;cell communication on cGAS&#8208;STING activation and provided a new perspective for antitumor immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;The activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway has shown promise in enhancing antitumor immunity. However, the pathway involved de novo transcription and translation processes, which delays immune responses. Besides, the rapid clearance of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) by extracellular hydrolase limits its availability, attenuating STING signaling and resulting in insufficient therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes With Semi&#8208;Solvated Hexafluoroisopropyl Methyl Ether Diluent for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

The lithiophilic and lithiophobic groups in hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether diluent can sustain rapid Li&#8314; transport and anion&#8211;cation aggregates enrichment in LHCEs. The accelerated Li&#8314; transport, desolvation kinetics, and the formed robust SEI endow Li||LiFePO4 cell with the capacity retention of 92.2% after 150 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 91.3% after 60 cycles at 65&#160;&#176;C. The Li||NCM811 pouch cell delivers the capacity retention of 91.6% after 75 cycles.








Abstract
Conventional electrolytes in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) suffer from irreversible interfacial degradation at elevated temperatures and sluggish Li&#8314; desolvation/transport kinetics under cryogenic conditions. Herein, we present an innovative semi&#8208;solvated hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME) diluent in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) that strategically addresses these limitations. Li&#8314; hopping networks within the electrolyte can be preserved even at low temperatures due to the coordination of lithiophilic groups in HFME molecules with Li&#8314;. Simultaneously, lithiophobic group induced spatial confinement effects promote the formation of anion&#8211;cation aggregates (AGGs), significantly optimizing Li&#8314; desolvation kinetics and boosting the formation of inorganic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with exceptional thermal stability. Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) cell with the diluent&#8208;coordinated LHCEs (DCL) can deliver 125.4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 initial capacity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with 92.2% retention after 150 cycles. Under elevated temperatures (65&#160;&#176;C), the DCL&#8208;based Li||LFP cell can maintain the capacity retention of 91.3% over 60 cycles. The Li||NCM811 pouch cell (10&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;6.5&#160;cm, capacity: 1000&#160;mA&#160;h) based on the DCL exhibits outstanding cycling stability, retaining 91.6% of its initial capacity after 75 cycles. This work pioneers a solvent chemistry paradigm through spatially modulated solvation structures, establishing fundamental design principles for electrolyte for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range LMBs.

Mechanosynthesis of polyZIF overcomes MOF&#8208;polymer phase incompatibility via in&#8208;situ polymer&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Im coordination networks. Pore architecture engineering yielded molecular&#8208;sieving membrane transport channels that enhanced butadiene permeance to 332 GPU while maintaining outstanding selectivities against C4 hydrocarbons through the size&#8208;exclusion mechanisms. Scalable manufacturing of polyZIF membranes (&#8764;80 cm2) was realized.








Abstract
The integration of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with polymers for efficient C4 hydrocarbon separation membranes remains challenging, primarily due to inherent phase incompatibility. This work presents an in&#8208;situ synthesis strategy for polymer&#8208;zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (polyZIF), utilizing polymer&#8208;metal&#8208;ligand coordination bonds combined with structural directing agents to produce crystalline microporous frameworks. With an accessible BET surface area of 261 m2 g&#8722;1 and a permanent porosity of ca. 4.42&#160;&#197;, polyZIF membrane demonstrates butadiene permeance (&#8764;332 GPU) and the selectivity over n&#8208;butene, n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butene, and iso&#8208;butane (17.2, 28.1, 21.5, and 34.8) under mixed gas conditions, respectively. Demonstrating practical scalability, the improved dispersibility and reduced interfacial defects in polyZIF facilitates fabrication of large&#8208;area defect&#8208;free membranes (up to 80 cm2) while maintaining robust C4 separation performance. This advancement not only establishes a novel preparation for constructing polyZIF membranes with C4 hydrocarbon molecular&#8208;sieving capability but also provides critical insights into industrial application of ZIF&#8208;based polymer membranes.

The TOC graphic illustrates the dual&#8208;antenna ligand strategy in Ln&#8208;MOF scintillators, enhancing X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. It highlights energy transfer mechanisms leading to Eu3+ emission. The Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen scintillator achieves high relative light yield and water stability, enabling underwater and dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF) scintillators are promising for X&#8208;ray imaging owing to their structural tunability and high X&#8208;ray attenuation. However, achieving efficient triplet&#8208;sensitized scintillation remains challenging due to the inefficient energy transfer between organic ligand triplets and lanthanide centers, leading to weak radioluminescence and limited imaging resolution. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;antenna ligand strategy by synergizing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybis (benzoic acid) (Oba) and phenanthroline derivatives (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#160;=&#160;Phen; or Bathophenanthroline&#160;=&#160;Bphen) with Eu3+ ions, constructing ultrabright Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen and Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen scintillators. Notably, Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen demonstrated a record relative light yield of 60331&#160;&#177;&#160;&#160;28 photons MeV&#8722;1, outperforming Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen by 71%. This superior scintillation performance originates from an 86.3&#160;&#177;&#160;0.19% photoluminescence quantum yield, attributed to enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer efficiency and the suppression of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking among organic chromophore ligands. Besides, the fabrication of flexible Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen films achieves a spatial resolution of 37.0&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1 in static imaging and enables real&#8208;time dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging at 60 fps (2&#160;K). Additionally, it exhibited exceptional water stability, with negligible performance degradation in water for over 100 days, allowing clear underwater visualization of circuit boards under X&#8208;ray irradiation. It provides a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance water&#8208;stable scintillators via ligand engineering.

One&#8208;step production of aliphatic polyesters: An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed isomerizing dual hydroesterificative polymerization (IDHP) strategy was developed for direct poly(adipate)ester synthesis from readily available feedstocks of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, diols, and carbon monoxide. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the IDHP exhibited remarkable efficiency in producing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyesters.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(adipate)esters, are attracting substantial attention as sustainable materials due to their degradability, recyclability, and versatility in various applications. However, the conventional production of poly(adipate)esters relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes and petroleum&#8208;derived adipic acid (AA), whose synthesis poses environmental concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions. Herein, we introduce a novel Pd&#8208;catalyzed isomerizing dual hydroesterificative polymerization (IDHP) strategy for direct poly(adipate)ester synthesis from readily available feedstocks of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, diols, and carbon monoxide. Key to success lay in the utilization of an electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligand with bulky steric hindrance, which efficiently facilitated linear&#8208;selective isomerizing hydroesterification. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the isomerizing hydroesterificative polymerization exhibited remarkable efficiency in producing poly(adipate)esters. The resulting poly(adipate)esters possess a similar structure compared to those produced by traditional polycondensation. With abundant feedstocks and atom&#8208;economy, this methodology provides a practical and eco&#8208;friendly approach to the production of poly(adipate)esters with varied microstructures.

This study presents a platform for fabricating two&#8208;photon excitable carbon dot&#8208;based nanocomposite thin films using polymer brushes and electron&#8208;beam lithography.

Abstract
We present a versatile platform for fabricating two&#8208;photon excitable carbon dot&#8208;based nanocomposite thin films by harnessing the structural versatility of polymer brushes in combination with electron&#8208;beam lithography (EBL). This approach enables the precise spatial organization of carbon dots (CDs) at the nanoscale, facilitating dynamic modulation of their photoluminescent properties in response to environmental stimuli. Three model systems were examined, incorporating pH&#8208; and thermally responsive polymers, functionalized through covalent and dynamic covalent bonding strategies. By leveraging the spatial control afforded by nanostructured polymer brushes, we achieved precise tuning of optical properties while mitigating aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, a longstanding challenge in solid&#8208;state CD applications. In addition to the advances in controlling optical properties, this work highlights the potential of polymer brush systems to function as optically active, reprogrammable surfaces. The resulting nanoscale&#8208;engineered materials exhibit highly responsive, reconfigurable photonic behavior, offering a scalable pathway for integrating advanced optical interfaces into microchip technologies, biosensing platforms, and multiplexed diagnostic systems. The fusion of polymer brushes, carbon dots, and advanced lithographic techniques marks a substantial advancement in the development of functional materials with nanoscale precision and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antibacterial Therapy</title>

This study develops DHTPA, a NIR fluorescent, pH&#8208;responsive AIE photosensitizer that enhances photodynamic therapy for bacterial infections by promoting ROS generation in acidic environments, demonstrating effective antibacterial activity and accelerated wound healing in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Bacterial infections significantly alter the local microenvironment, with acidic byproducts from bacterial metabolism leading to a pronounced pH reduction. Leveraging this characteristic, we synthesized and identified DHTPA, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and pH&#8208;responsive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer, for enhanced photodynamic therapy against bacterial infections. DHTPA aggregates exhibit a 2.1&#8208;fold increase in ROS generation under weakly acidic conditions (pH 5.5) compared to neutral conditions (pH 7.4), attributed to its pH&#8208;dependent electronic structure modulation. Upon NIR light irradiation, DHTPA aggregates precisely respond to the acidic microenvironment, significantly boosting ROS production for efficient bacterial eradication. In vitro studies demonstrated that DHTPA achieved over 99.9% bactericidal efficiency against both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In a murine infected wound model, DHTPA treatment accelerated wound healing by 2.4 times, markedly reduced bacterial burden, and alleviated inflammatory responses, highlighting its therapeutic potential. By integrating NIR activation, pH responsiveness, and AIE properties, DHTPA presents a precise and efficient antibacterial therapeutic strategy, offering an innovative solution for the clinical management of bacterial infections.

         <title>Boosting Electronic Charge Transport in Conductive Hydrogels via Rapid Ion&#8208;Electron Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel featuring a hierarchical network with an inhomogeneous network is constructed from entangled PSS chains and PEDOT:PSS polycrystals. The dense PSS assemblies with ultrahigh ionic concentrations lower the electron hopping barrier between PEDOT microcrystals under an electric field&#8211;induced local polarization, thereby enhancing electron transport. As a result, the charge transport mechanism in these hydrogels becomes predominantly electronic rather than ionic, effectively mimicking the behavior of conventional electronic conductors.








Abstract
Traditional design of conductive hydrogels involves embedding conductive components within a hydrated polymeric network to establish interconnected electron pathways. While the hydration shell of the polymeric network is typically considered insulating, we demonstrate that it can enhance electron transport. Using a PEDOT:PSS hydrogel, we propose a hierarchical network with an inhomogeneous topological structure, consisting of entangled PSS chains, dense PSS assemblies, and PEDOT microcrystals. In the hydrated state, the dense PSS assemblies significantly lower the energy barrier for electron hopping between PEDOT microcrystals, thereby promoting electron transport. As a result, the charge transport mechanism in these hydrogels is predominantly electronic rather than ionic, effectively mimicking the behavior of electronic conductors. The charge transport rate reaches up to 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1, which is approximately five orders of magnitude higher than that of ion&#8208;based processes. This characteristic imparts the hydrogels with kinetically sensitive ion&#8208;electron transduction, enabling time&#8208;resolved electrochemical analysis of biochemical processes.

         <title>Giant Birefringence Enabled by the Highly Anisotropic Linear IX2&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br) Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel, easily grown birefringent crystals featuring linear interhalogen birefringence&#8208;active groups, IX&#8322;&#8315; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), namely [H&#8208;4AP][ICl&#8322;], [HDMA]&#8322;[ICl&#8322;]&#183;Cl, [H&#8208;4AP][IBr&#8322;], and [HDMA]&#8322;[IBr&#8322;]&#183;Br, exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions, while achieving an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap. 








Abstract
Birefringent crystals are essential for polarized optical devices, yet achieving large birefringence through rational design remains challenging. The key lies in constructing birefringence&#8208;active groups (BAGs) with giant polarization anisotropy and optimal spatial arrangements. Here, we report the successful construction of linear interhalogen BAGs, IX2&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), enabling giant polarization anisotropy. This was accomplished by simple halogenation of IO3&#8722; groups in an aqueous solution. Four novel birefringent crystals were synthesized: [H&#8208;4AP][ICl2] (1, 4AP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;aminopyridine), [HDMA]2[ICl2]&#183;Cl (2, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylamine), [H&#8208;4AP][IBr2] (3), and [HDMA]2[IBr2]&#183;Br (4). In all these compounds, the linear IX2&#8722; BAG adopts parallel arrangements, effectively maximizing synergistic polarization anisotropy. As a result, compounds 1&#8211;4 exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible (0.647, 0.585, 0.836, and 0.782 at 546&#160;nm) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions (0.510, 0.356, 0.762, and 0.509 at 1064&#160;nm), surpassing commercial birefringent crystals and many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. Furthermore, these compounds achieve an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap among linear BAG&#8208;based materials. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the IX2&#8722; BAGs play a dominant role in this exceptional birefringence.

     alt="Giant Birefringence Enabled by the Highly Anisotropic Linear IX2&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br) Building Blocks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four novel, easily grown birefringent crystals featuring linear interhalogen birefringence-active groups, IX&#8322;&#8315; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), namely [H-4AP][ICl&#8322;], [HDMA]&#8322;[ICl&#8322;]&#183;Cl, [H-4AP][IBr&#8322;], and [HDMA]&#8322;[IBr&#8322;]&#183;Br, exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible and near-infrared regions, while achieving an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birefringent crystals are essential for polarized optical devices, yet achieving large birefringence through rational design remains challenging. The key lies in constructing birefringence-active groups (BAGs) with giant polarization anisotropy and optimal spatial arrangements. Here, we report the successful construction of linear interhalogen BAGs, IX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), enabling giant polarization anisotropy. This was accomplished by simple halogenation of IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups in an aqueous solution. Four novel birefringent crystals were synthesized: [H-4AP][ICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 4AP&#160;=&#160;4-aminopyridine), [HDMA]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#183;Cl (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylamine), [H-4AP][IBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and [HDMA]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[IBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#183;Br (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). In all these compounds, the linear IX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; BAG adopts parallel arrangements, effectively maximizing synergistic polarization anisotropy. As a result, compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible (0.647, 0.585, 0.836, and 0.782 at 546&#160;nm) and near-infrared (NIR) regions (0.510, 0.356, 0.762, and 0.509 at 1064&#160;nm), surpassing commercial birefringent crystals and many state-of-the-art materials. Furthermore, these compounds achieve an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap among linear BAG-based materials. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the IX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; BAGs play a dominant role in this exceptional birefringence. This study demonstrates the remarkable potential of linear interhalogen anions for developing high-performance birefringent crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Position Effects of Monoatom Doping in Silver Nanoclusters on Oxygen Reduction by Single Entity Electrochemistry</title>

We employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the oxygen reduction behaviors of single monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pt, and Cu) nanoclusters. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with the intracluster migration of the Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 nanoclusters.








Abstract
Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) with monoatom doping represents an effective strategy to enhance catalytic performances due to the synergistic interactions between the dopant and host atoms. However, in&#8208;depth understanding the position effects of monoatom doping within alloying NCs, particularly at the atomic level, remains elusive. Here, we employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the electrocatalytic behaviors of individual monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pt, and Cu) NCs toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By relying on high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput electrochemical measurements, we successfully discriminated the effects of monoatom variation in M1Ag24 NCs on ORR activity at the single atom resolution and identified different M1Ag24 NCs across characteristic populations. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with intracluster migration of Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 NCs. This work demonstrates a novel approach for in situ identifying the position effects of foreign doping atoms on the electrocatalytic activity of alloy NCs at the single atom level.

         <title>Nonbonding Electron Inversion&#8208;Driven Structural Engineering: Synergistic Enhancement of Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a nonbonding electron&#8208;inversion strategy, the introduction of supertetrahedral units mitigates the weak optical anisotropy caused by the aggregation of nonbonding electrons at pseudo&#8208;vacancies, achieving simultaneous regulation of both linear and nonlinear optical properties. This transformation led to a 219% and 125% enhancement in &#916;n and SHG response.








Abstract
The simultaneous optimization of large birefringence (&#916;n, a linear optical property) and strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG, a nonlinear optical (NLO) property) in a single crystal remains a significant challenge due to the inherently distinct structural requirements for these properties. Although nonbonding electrons have been extensively studied in oxides and chalcogenides, research has predominantly focused on their role along polar axes, leaving their influence along 4&#175;$\bar 4$ axes in tetrahedral stacking largely unexplored. Herein, we propose a nonbonding electron&#8208;inversion strategy to overcome phase&#8208;matching limitations in defect diamond&#8208;like structures. By incorporating T2&#8208;[Ga4S10] supertetrahedral motifs, we successfully synthesized [Ba4Cl2][CdGa4S10] (space group: I4&#175;$\bar 4$), which exhibits a 219% enhancement in &#916;n compared to the nonphase&#8208;matching parent structure Cd2GaS4. The weakly bound nonbonding electrons, governed by atomic potentials, demonstrate strong SHG responses under optical fields. The compound [Ba4Cl2][CdGa4S10] not only achieves a broad transmission range (0.28&#8211;18.6&#160;&#181;m) and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (40.1&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2) but also optimally balances a wide bandgap (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.58&#160;eV) and a large SHG response (1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2), representing one of the best&#8208;performing Cd&#8208;based materials to date. This work introduces the first phase&#8208;matching design strategy based on nonbonding electron&#8208;driven structure&#8211;property relationships, providing critical insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

A universal sulfur&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to enhance the direct 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and suppress the competing 2e&#8722; pathways in various carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including Co&#9472;N@C, Ni&#9472;N@C, Mn&#9472;N@C, and N@C. The optimized Co&#9472;N/Co@C&#8208;S Zn&#8208;air battery exhibits impressive power density and rate performance, as well as a remarkable lifespan of 2500&#160;h with minimal charge/discharge voltage fluctuations.








Abstract
The direct four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (4e&#8722; ORR) critically governs efficiency and lifespan in metal&#8211;air batteries and fuel cells, yet selectively suppressing competitive 2e&#8722; and stepwise 2e&#8722;pathways that generate corrosive hydrogen peroxide remains a major challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the strategic incorporation of secondary coordinated sulfur atoms into transition metal&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts to effectively promote direct 4e&#8722; ORR and simultaneously suppress undesirable 2e&#8722; pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando spectroscopy reveal that enhanced adsorption of key intermediate *OOH facilitates efficient O&#9472;O bond cleavage, underpinning altered catalytic selectivity. Importantly, this approach is universally applicable to various carbon&#8208;based catalysts, including Co&#9472;N@C, Ni&#9472;N@C, Mn&#9472;N@C, and N@C. Specifically, a sulfur&#8208;mediated Co&#9472;N/Co@C catalyst, comprising Co&#9472;N4 sites and Co nanoparticles, dramatically lowers the 2e&#8722; O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 rate constant to merely 0.05&#8208;fold of its original value at 0.78&#160;V. Consequently, Zn&#8208;air batteries using Co&#9472;N/Co@C&#8208;S as cathode exhibits an outstanding peak power density of 220&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, remarkable lifespan over 2500&#160;h, and outstanding rate performance from 5 to 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work paves a generalizable route for designing highly active and selective electrocatalysts suitable for advanced long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Assembled From {Ni6} Nodes for Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;organic cages including MOC&#8208;18N, MOC&#8208;24N, and MOC&#8208;36N utilizing the novel hexa&#8208;nuclear {Ni6} unit as three or four connected nodes were successfully isolated, displaying superior photocatalytic activity and selectivity in converting CO2 into CO.








Abstract
Constructing cluster&#8208;based nodes and using them as catalytic sites can bring new structure and function for metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). However, successful examples are very limited. Herein, we found that a 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (Hmmt) based {Ni6} subunit is robust in building such MOCs. The {Ni6} node is based on the central Ni4 cubane and two wing Ni(II) ions with virtually three or four connected features. When various carboxylate ligands are incorporated the triangular prismatic [Ni18(Hmmt)3(mmt)12(BPDC)6(CH3O)12(H2O)6(DMF)6] (4/MOC&#8208;18N, H2BPDC&#160;=&#160;biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid), tetrahedral&#8208;like [Ni24(Hmmt)4(mmt)16(BTC)4(CH3O)16Cl4(H2O)4(DMF)5(CH3OH)3] (5/MOC&#8208;24N, H3BTC&#160;=&#160;1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid) and the octahedral [Ni36(Hmmt)6(mmt)24(BTC)8(CH3O)24(H2O)12(DMF)12] (6/MOC&#8208;36N) can be isolated. Interestingly, MOCs 4&#8211;6 can uptake CO2 in solid states. Moreover, they can effectively and selectively convert CO2 into CO under visible light owing to the active wing Ni(II) ions, which are ancillarily coordinated with solvent molecules. All of them show turnover frequencies larger than 3500&#160;&#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity higher than 90%. This is a much higher performance compared to the usage of cage space for CO2 reduction in previously reported MOCs and competitive to most Ni(II)&#8208;based simple coordination complexes. As such, this work may open a new paradigm for designing node based catalytic function for MOCs.

         <title>Synthesis of Nitriles from Dinitrogen via N&#8208;Atom Transfer on Rhenium Nitride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the reduction of rhenium trichloride or oxo dichloride bearing a rigid acriPNP ligand under an atmosphere of N2, we facilely prepared a terminal rhenium nitride [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl]. Upon reaction with RC(O)X (X&#160;=&#160;OTf, Cl), the nitride directly afforded a wide array of nitriles. Remarkably, these nitrile&#8208;forming protocols concomitantly regenerate the nitride precursors, efficiently completing a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal mediated dinitrogen (N2) splitting into terminal nitrido moiety followed by N&#8208;atom transfer is an attractive strategy for N2 fixation beyond ammonia. While the functionalization of N2&#8208;derived nitride complexes have been widely investigated, their N&#8208;atom transfer reactions to provide N&#8208;containing organic compounds were rarely reported. Herein, we report the synthesis of a rhenium nitride complex [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl] (acriPNP&#160;=&#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)&#8208;2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;acridin&#8208;10&#8208;ide) via reductive N2 cleavage from either rhenium trichloride or rhenium oxo dichloride complexes. The rhenium nitride exhibits N&#8208;atom transfer reactivity with acyl triflates or chlorides under mild conditions, affording nitriles concomitant with the regeneration of the nitride precursors, rhenium oxo or trichloride complexes, respectively. This overall N&#8208;atom transfer from N2 to acyl electrophiles produced a series of alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclic nitriles, in moderate to good yields, offering a versatile and practical strategy for accessing 15N&#8208;labeled nitriles. This work established a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle, offering valuable insights into transformations of N2 into nitrogenous products.

         <title>Development of Chiral Bisphosphine Ligands with a Terminal Olefin Enables Asymmetric Orthogonal Auto&#8208;Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an innovative catalytic strategy, orthogonal auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (OATC), which seamlessly integrates transition&#8208;metal catalysis with organocatalysis in a single reactor. By rationally designing novel chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos), we have accomplished the first one&#8208;pot asymmetric OATC involving four distinct catalytic cycles, achieving excellent yield and enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (ATC) leverages the multiple roles of the catalyst, facilitating the direct synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials in a highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner. However, in conventional ATC, employing a single catalyst imposes significant limitations on the variety of catalyzed reactions. Herein, we present a novel catalysis strategy termed &#8220;orthogonal auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (OATC)&#8221;, which provides the unique opportunity to develop more efficient chemical transformations that cannot be achieved with existing catalytic modes. An unprecedented tandem annulation process involving four different catalytic cycles via asymmetric OATC is demonstrated. The enantio&#8208;determining step is a previously unrealized Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic lactonization. The key to the whole success lies in the development of a new class of chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos) that addressed not only the racemization issue of allylic ester products in classic &#960;&#8208;allylmetal chemistry, but also the inherent compatibility challenges in transition&#8208;metal/organo dual catalytic system. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the vital role of the terminal olefin in TOPhos, enabling the differentiation of competitive enantioselective pathways.

         <title>Control over S(VI)&#8208;Stereogenic Center: NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Cyclic Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides (SIAs) via desymmetrization of prochiral SIA anions is presented. The in situ generated acylazolium from easily available aldehydes using NHC was intercepted with SIA anions to deliver configurationally stable N&#8208;acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies, including DFT, provide insight into the possible reaction pathway, and functionalization of the SIAs are also provided.








Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of aza&#8208;sulfur(VI) compounds holds significant potential in pharmaceuticals owing to their broad spectrum of biological properties. Herein, we report the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides (SIAs). The free N&#8211;H containing SIAs often exhibit configurational lability through tautomerization. We investigated this by demonstrating their nonsymmetric nature in both solid state and solution. The in situ generated chiral acylazolium intermediates from easily accessible aldehydes in the presence of NHC and oxidant were trapped with the prochiral cyclic SIA anions, allowing the enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable N&#8208;acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies reveal that the present strategy proceeds via the desymmetrization of the prochiral SIA anions. Moreover, the derivatization of the synthesized N&#8208;acyl SIAs highlights the practical utility of the present methodology.

The in situ generated chiral acylazolium intermediates from easily accessible aldehydes in the presence of NHC and oxidant were trapped with the prochiral cyclic SIA anions, allowing the enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies reveal that the present strategy proceeds via the desymmetrization of the prochiral SIA anions. Moreover, the derivatization of the synthesized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl SIAs highlights the practical utility of the present methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topological Control Over Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Elucidating Electron Transfer Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrinic 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with distinct sql and bex topologies but identical chemical compositions were constructed to probe topology&#8208;dependent electron transfer. Systematic characterization demonstrated that bex&#8208;COFs exhibit enhanced electron transfer kinetics and modified band structures compared to their sql analogues, revealing topology&#8208;directed electron regulation.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising functional materials due to their programmable architectures and tunable functionalities. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of porphyrin&#8208;based 2D COFs remains restricted by the prevalent use of sql topology, hindering comprehensive structure&#8208;property exploration. Herein, we systematically designed and synthesized porphyrinic 2D COFs featuring distinct sql and bex topological configurations. Comprehensive structural characterization confirmed precise control over lattice geometries, revealing monoporous structure in sql topology versus biporous architecture in bex topology. Electrochemical investigations uncovered topology&#8208;governed electron transport characteristics, with the unique coordination geometry of bex topology exhibiting enhanced electron transfer efficiency. Band structure analysis demonstrated that topological configuration and chemical composition collectively modulate electronic structures. Inspired by these findings, we developed nickel&#8208;incorporated bex&#8208;COFs for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. The optimized Ni&#8208;BBFPP&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF with bex topology demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, achieving a low overpotential of 342&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which surpasses most reported porphyrin&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This study not only significantly expands the structural repertoire of porphyrinic COFs but also establishes explicit correlations between topological engineering and electrocatalytic performance, providing fundamental design principles for advanced energy conversion materials.

         <title>AI.zymes: A Modular Platform for Evolutionary Enzyme Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite significant progress in protein design, enzyme catalysis remains a major challenge. Here, we present AI.zymes, a computational platform for evolutionary enzyme design. Through iterative rounds of design and screening, AI.zymes integrates cutting&#8208;edge bioengineering tools (ProteinMPNN, Rosetta, ESMFold, FieldTools, etc.) into a modular pipeline. AI.zymes was experimentally benchmarked by enhancing the catalytic activity of a model enzyme 7.7&#8208;fold.








Abstract
The ability to create new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes would substantially advance bioengineering, medicine, and the chemical industry. Despite recent breakthroughs in protein design and structure prediction, designing novel biocatalysts remains challenging. Here, we present AI.zymes, a modular platform integrating cutting&#8208;edge protein engineering algorithms within an evolutionary framework (https://github.com/bunzela/AIzymes). By combining bioengineering tools such as Rosetta, ESMFold, ProteinMPNN, and FieldTools in iterative rounds of design and selection, AI.zymes can optimize a broad range of catalytically relevant properties. In addition to enhancing transition state affinity and protein stability, AI.zymes can also improve properties that are not targeted by the employed design algorithms. For instance, AI.zymes can enhance electrostatic catalysis by iteratively selecting variants with stronger catalytic electric fields. Benchmarking AI.zymes on the promiscuous Kemp eliminase activity of ketosteroid isomerase led to a 7.7&#8208;fold activity increase after experimentally testing just 7 variants. Due to its modularity, AI.zymes can readily incorporate emerging design algorithms, paving the way for a unifying framework for enzyme design.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Enable Spontaneous Singlet Oxygen Generation Without Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized and characterized, which are capable of spontaneously generating singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) by directly activating atmospheric triplet oxygen (3O&#8322;) without requiring light irradiation. The highly selective production of &#185;O&#8322; by these MOFs was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and probe experiments. These materials demonstrate promising applications in aerobic sulfide oxidation and antibacterial systems, leveraging their ability to efficiently generate reactive oxygen species under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a widely used reactive oxygen species (ROS), making the development of new materials capable of efficiently generating it highly important. In this work, we report a series of isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), named JNU&#8208;300 (JNU&#160;=&#160;Jinan University), can spontaneously generate 1O2 by directly activating triplet oxygen (3O2) from the air without the need for additional light irradiation. The highly selective generation of 1O2 by JNU&#8208;300 is verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and probe experiments for 1O2. The generated 1O2 can be employed for aerobic oxidation of sulfide and antibacterial application. Mechanism studies revealed that the framework structure, and the adsorption and polarization of O2 by the coordination units of JNU&#8208;300, are crucial for the 1O2 generation. To the best of our knowledge, MOFs JNU&#8208;300 are the first MOF material capable of producing 1O2 by activating 3O2 in the absence of light at room temperature. This work provides new insights into the design and construction of functional MOF materials capable of generating 1O2 via activating 3O2 without light irradiation, opening new possibilities for their application in specialized fields that require 1O2 in the dark.

         <title>Electrochemically Promoted Activation of Light Alkanes at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs two Cu electrodes in the presence of oxygen gas to selectively convert ethane and propane into alkenes and oxygenates under ambient conditions, achieving excellent stability by periodically reversing the current direction. Our approach attains a combined selectivity for ethylene and acetic acid exceeding 96% and achieves acetic acid concentrations as high as 19&#160;mM during prolonged operation, establishing a new performance benchmark for the electrochemical activation of light alkanes.








Abstract
The electrochemical activation of light alkanes into value&#8208;added products represents a promising pathway for sustainable chemical synthesis and the storage of renewable energy. In this study, we introduce an electrochemically promoted system that employs copper plates as electrode and oxygen as oxidant, capable of converting ethane into ethylene and acetic acid with production rates of 6.9 and 6.2&#160;&#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, with a combined selectivity exceeding 92%, under ambient conditions. Additionally, this system can convert propane to propylene at a rate of 11.6&#160;&#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, with selectivity reaching up to 86%. A 10&#160;h run with ethane demonstrates consistent production of ethylene and acetic acid, with a sustained selectivity above 96%, and achieves an acetic acid concentration of 19&#160;mM. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals the active surface and a critical reaction intermediate. Combining with partial pressure dependence study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a potential reaction mechanism involving the competitive adsorption of oxygen and alkane producing an alkyl group as a key reaction step in the reaction process.

         <title>Promoting Alkane Binding: Crystallization of a Cationic Manganese(I)&#8208;Pentane &#963;&#8208;Complex from Solution</title>

         <dc:description>
Oxidation of Mn&#8322;(CO)&#8321;&#8320; under pseudo gas&#8208;phase conditions generates the weakly coordinated 16 valence electron complex [Mn(CO)&#8325;]&#8314;, which binds n&#8208;pentane as the strongest ligand available in this system. Three isomers were characterized by low&#8208;temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The oxidation of metal complex dimers is a new route to generate reactive metal&#8211;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8211;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes are key intermediates in C&#8211;H activation and, until now, analysis of these species has been restricted to either the solution OR the solid state. Here we present a synthetic methodology that converts Mn2(CO)10 in a noncoordinating solvent environment to [Mn(CO)5]+ at room temperature, and this species binds n&#8208;pentane as the strongest interacting ligand available. Three isomers of the n&#8208;pentane &#963;&#8208;complexes were studied in detail by solution NMR&#8208;spectroscopy at low temperature. Two isomers of [Mn(CO)5(n&#8208;pentane)]+ crystallize from solution at room temperature and their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The oxidation of metal complex dimers in solution to generate reactive metal cations, which bind alkanes as the strongest available ligand, is a new and probably general approach to generate metal&#8208;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes.

         <title>Facile N&#9552;N Bond Cleavage of Cis&#8208;Azobenzene with Bis&#8208;silylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpectedly easy N&#9552;N bond scission of cis&#8208;azobenzene using two bis&#8208;silylenes with different spacers and distinct SiII&#183;&#183;&#183;SiII distances is reported. While both bis&#8208;silylenes enable C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#8208;bond activation of trans&#8208;azobenzene, the cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated activation of cis&#8208;azobenzene leads to bis&#8208;silamines (Si&#9552;N) and related novel products. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the mechanism and nature of the intermediates of the N&#9552;N cleavage products.








Abstract
The very different features of cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated N&#9552;N bond activation of trans&#8208; vs. cis&#8208;azobenzene are reported, employing two bis&#8208;silylenes with distinct intramolecular Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si distances, PhN(LSi:)&#8322; 1 (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(tBuN)&#8322;, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 2.9&#160;&#197;) and XT(LSi:)&#8322; 2 (XT&#160;=&#160;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 4.3&#160;&#197;). While trans&#8208;azobenzene reacts with both bis&#8208;silylenes to form C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#160;bond activation products, the cis&#8208;isomer undergoes only N&#9552;N bond scission. Thus, the reaction of 1 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at room temperature affords the unprecedented N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 4, featuring a bis&#8208;silaimine with terminal and bridging Si&#9552;N moieties. In contrast, the reaction of 2 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at &#8211;30 &#176;C in THF allows for the isolation of the [1+2] cycloaddition intermediate 6, containing a three&#8208;membered SiN&#8322; ring (siladiazirane), which rearranges to the N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 8 at room temperature. Compound 6 reacts with one additional equivalent of cis&#8208;azobenzene to form bis&#8208;silaazirane 7 with two SiN&#8322; rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support stepwise Si(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Si(II) cooperative activation mechanisms and provide insights into the role of bis&#8208;silylenes for selective N&#9552;N cleavage reactions.

         <title>Helical Columnar Liquid Crystal Exhibiting Both Polarization Retention and Ferroelectric Switching at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A star&#8208;shaped liquid crystal containing a polar 1,2,3&#8208;triazole group demonstrates a helical columnar assembly formed through triazolyl hydrogen bonding, resulting in stable axial macrodipoles. These macrodipoles can be ferroelectrically switched and consistently maintain a parallel arrangement even after the field is removed. The ferroelectric properties are operable at room temperature.








Abstract
Ferroelectric columnar liquid crystals (FCLCs) with switchable bistable axial polarizations are promising candidates for high&#8208;density ferroelectric random&#8208;access memory (FeRAM). However, FCLCs simultaneously exhibiting uniform polarization arrangement and ferroelectric switching at room temperature (RT) remain elusive. Herein, we report an RT&#8208;operable FCLC based on C3&#8208;symmetric star&#8208;shaped mesogen with polar linkers. Two CLCs, 1 and 2, were synthesized incorporating 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and amide linkers, respectively. 1 undergoes a ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition accompanied by a structural change from helical to a nonhelical columnar phase. Notably, the ferroelectric switching is operable down to RT, with complete retention of its axial macrodipole after removal of the electric field. In contrast, 2 forms only a nonhelical columnar LC phase, displaying paraelectric behavior. The contrasting self&#8208;assembly and dielectric properties are attributed to the differences in the polar unit size. This study demonstrates that the mesogen extension with a bulky 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker enables the realization of an&#160;FCLC operable at RT, offering significant potential for high&#8208;density FeRAM applications.

         <title>An Atmosphere&#8208;Responsive Protective Strategy Based on Deciphering the Anode Degradation Mechanism in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the intrinsic degradation mechanism of lithium anodes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and proposes a water&#8208;responsive protective layer to prevent harmful side reactions. The designed protection strategy responds to environmental composition, ensuring anode stability and battery operation, which provides guidance for the practical application and development of advanced and durable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries, with high energy density and CO2 utilization, are considered a promising candidate for Mars exploration. However, they continue to face challenges such as limited cycle life and significant polarization caused by anode degradation, which is often overlooked and whose underlying mechanism remains unclear. This work revealed the anode failure mechanism, identifying a water&#8208;triggered degradation process, which depletes active lithium content, and developed an atmosphere&#8208;induced protective strategy. The degradation is triggered by trace water and sustained by the CO2 component, which results in transforming active lithium into Li2CO3. Thus, a strategy was provided to respond to the water molecules brought by the semi&#8208;hermetic system and high charging voltage. The protective layer was in situ polymerized and can interact with water molecules, leading to further polymerization, thereby inhibiting side reactions, significantly extending the battery's lifespan. The Li&#8211;CO2 batteries can achieve stable cycling exceeding 1000&#160;h, more than twice the time compared to the unprotected case. This study revealed the fundamental mechanism of anode degradation in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, providing a theoretical basis for the development of subsequent anode protection strategies. Additionally, it offers a viable method for anode protection in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

The degradation is triggered by trace water and sustained by the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; component, which results in transforming active lithium into Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, a strategy was provided to respond to the water molecules brought by the semi-hermetic system and high charging voltage. The protective layer was in situ polymerized and can interact with water molecules, leading to further polymerization, thereby inhibiting side reactions, significantly extending the battery's lifespan. The Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries can achieve stable cycling exceeding 1000&#160;h, more than twice the time compared to the unprotected case. This study revealed the fundamental mechanism of anode degradation in Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, providing a theoretical basis for the development of subsequent anode protection strategies. Additionally, it offers a viable method for anode protection in Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

High defective Fe2O3 nanoparticles on Cu synthesis by plasma introduced multifunctional oxygen vacancies achieving 100% NH3 selectivity through a plasma&#8208;electrochemical system capable of directly reducing air to gaseous NH3.








Abstract
Current ammonia (NH&#8323;) synthesis is hindered by challenges including N&#8322; activation, NH&#8323; separation and process complexity. Here, we report a plasma&#8208;electrochemical process for the production of gaseous ammonia from air generated NOx, decoupled from processes employing liquid phase intermediaries such as NO&#8323;&#8315; and final product (NH4+). Importantly, this process uses air for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions and directly produces gaseous NH&#8323; which facilitates efficient product separation. For NOx reduction to NH&#8323;, we propose a universal strategy combining plasma pretreatment and wet chemical calcination to introduce multifunctional oxygen vacancies. The resulting highly defective Fe&#8322;O&#8323; nanoparticles on Cu achieves a significant ammonia production rate of 628 nmol&#183;s&#8315;&#185;&#183;cm&#8315;2, along with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Family of Chiral Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a Fused Sidechain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of chiral non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a fused sidechain was synthesized and used as efficient ligands in three copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reactions at the catalyst loading of 1&#160;mol%, including SN2&#8242; silylation, conjugate silylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and silylation of azadienes.








Abstract
Although a considerable number of chiral nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been developed yet it is highly necessary to develop new NHCs bearing multiple sites for facile modifications of both electronic nature and steric hindrance. Herein, we uncover a new family of chiral non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a fused sidechain, whose precursors are synthesized by a simple five&#8208;step route. The synthesis includes Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling or nucleophilic addition/oxidation, chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinolines, bromination at C8, Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, and cyclization with methyl orthoformate. Among nine prepared NHCs, YC&#8208;NHC8 is the optimal ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric SN2&#8242; silylation, YC&#8208;NHC3 works as the best ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate silylation of simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and YC&#8208;NHC9 serves as the most suitable ligand for copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric silylation of azadienes. Remarkably, these three reactions are successfully run under a catalyst loading of 0.1&#160;mol%, indicating that YC&#8208;NHCs may have the potential to be broadly used in efficient asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts With Improved Metal Loading for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>

Replacing Zn atoms with Fe in Fe1&#8211;Zn1&#8211;N&#8211;C, a porphyrin MOF&#8208;pyrolyzed porous carbon involving single&#8208;atom Fe and Zn sites, affords FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C with improved single&#8208;atom Fe loading. The resulting FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C exhibits an exceptionally high ammonia synthesis rate under mild conditions (1 atm, 300 &#176;C), significantly outperforming all other counterparts, the traditional dominant fused iron and Ru&#8208;based precious metal catalysts.








Abstract
Ammonia synthesis is a cornerstone in the chemical industry. Given that the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process requires very high temperature and pressure, it is imperative to develop catalysts capable of facilitating ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. In this work, a post&#8208;metal replacement strategy is developed to improve the Fe loading in single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;implanted N&#8208;doped carbon catalysts. Starting from the Zn&#8211;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C material with single&#8208;atom Zn and Fe sites coexisting in N&#8208;doped porous carbon pyrolyzed from porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the replacement of single&#8208;atom Zn with Fe sites is performed, which significantly increases the Fe loading from 1.33 to 2.39 wt%. This effectively suppresses the migration and agglomeration of Fe, yielding Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C with high metal loading (FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C). Notably, the FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a catalytic rate of 558&#160;&#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at 300 &#176;C for ammonia synthesis at atmospheric pressure, far surpassing the performance of the traditional dominant fused iron and even Ru&#8208;based precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Inverted Chiroptical Properties of Hybrid Metal Halides Through Reversible Chiral Induction Driven by External and Internal Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible chiral induction strategy has achieved chiroptical property inversion of chiral hybrid metal halides driven by external and internal chirality transfer from a single chiral reagent. Both externally and internally induced chiral crystals exhibit significant chiroptical response, photoluminescence, and second harmonic generation. The multi&#8208;path chirality transfer provides new insights for construction of functional chiral materials.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) are commonly constructed by introducing pairs of enantiomorphic chiral precursors through a single chirality transfer pathway, which may limit the regulation of chiral structural diversity and chiroptoelectronic properties. Herein, we propose a new strategy for achieving reversible chiral induction of OIHMHs with inverted chiroptical properties through external and internal chirality transfer pathways, by utilizing a single chiral reagent R&#8208;/S&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA). Specifically, R&#8208;MBA can externally induce chiral enrichment of M&#8208;DMA4(Bi0.486In0.511Sb0.003)Cl7 (M&#8208;DMA4(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl7, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylammonium cation) without integrating into structure. Conversely, R&#8208;MBA can insert into structure, internally inducing the formation of DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi0.634In0.362Sb0.004)Cl6 (DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl6), which reverses&#160;the structural arrangements and inverts both linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. Both externally and internally induced chiral OIHMHs exhibit significant chiroptical responses with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and second harmonic generation (SHG). Moreover, the externally induced centimeter&#8208;sized rhombic single crystal enables morphology&#8208; and angle&#8208;dependent inverted circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of &#8764;0.02, through single crystal anisotropy. The internal induction enhances SHG intensity by nine&#8208;fold and increases PLQY to 98.9%. This multi&#8208;path chirality transfer, based on a single chiral reagent, can significantly broaden the structural scope of functional chiral OIHMH materials and facilitate the regulation of chiroptoelectronic properties.

Specifically, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MBA can externally induce chiral enrichment of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-DMA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.486&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;0.511&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.003&lt;/sub&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-DMA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Bi-In-Sb)Cl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylammonium cation) without integrating into structure. Conversely, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MBA can insert into structure, internally inducing the formation of DMA(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.634&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;0.362&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.004&lt;/sub&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (DMA(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Bi-In-Sb)Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which reverses&#160;the structural arrangements and inverts both linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. Both externally and internally induced chiral OIHMHs exhibit significant chiroptical responses with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and second harmonic generation (SHG). Moreover, the externally induced centimeter-sized rhombic single crystal enables morphology- and angle-dependent inverted circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of &#8764;0.02, through single crystal anisotropy. The internal induction enhances SHG intensity by nine-fold and increases PLQY to 98.9%. This multi-path chirality transfer, based on a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; chiral reagent, can significantly broaden the structural scope of functional chiral OIHMH materials and facilitate the regulation of chiroptoelectronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Ru Species on Poly(heptazine imide) Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with H2O beyond 800 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>

A unique RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst is assembled by precisely anchoring Ru SAs and NPs on PHI via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#9472;N bonds, creating a build&#8208;in electron field (BIEF) that directs charge separation and rushes electron migration to Ru NPs, together with an Ru SA&#8208;induced impurity level to extend optical harvesting. The catalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for CO2 reduction with H2O, affording a record&#8208;high AQE beyond 800&#160;nm, while generating the valuable oxidation product H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion with H2O to carbonaceous fuels is a desirable strategy for CO2 management and solar utilization, yet its efficiency remains suboptimal. Herein, efficient and durable CO2 photoreduction is realized over a RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst assembled by anchoring Ru single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) onto poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#8208;N bonds, respectively. This catalyst shows an unsurpassed CO production (32.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1), a record&#8208;high apparent quantum efficiency (0.26%) beyond 800&#160;nm, and the formation of the valuable H2O2. Ru SAs tune PHI's electronic structure to promote in&#8208;plane charge transfer to Ru NPs, forming a built&#8208;in electron field at the interface, which directs electron&#8208;hole separation and rushes excited electron movement from Ru&#8208;PHI to Ru NPs. Simultaneously, Ru SAs introduce an impurity level in PHI to endow long&#8208;wavelength photoabsorption, while Ru NPs strengthen CO2 adsorption/activation and expedite CO desorption. These effects of Ru species together effectively ensure CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The CO2 reduction on the catalyst is revealed to follow the pathway CO2&#8594; *CO2&#8594; *COOH&#8594; *CO&#8594; CO, based on the intermediates identified by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and further supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Induced Br&#248;nsted Acidity Enables Controllable Hydrocracking of Polyolefin Waste to Liquid Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/NbOx nanorod catalyst enables efficient polyolefin hydrocracking, achieving 95% yield of liquid fuels (C5&#8211;20) under mild conditions. Operando spectroscopy and DFT reveal Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated via hydrogen spillover, as key catalytic sites, exhibiting a near&#8208;linear correlation with hydrocracking activity.








Abstract
Efficient upcycling of polyolefin waste into liquid fuels remains challenging due to over&#8208;cracking and the lack of sufficient acidity in non&#8208;zeolitic catalysts. Here, we report a Ni/niobium oxide nanorod (Ni/NbOx) catalyst that achieves 95% selectivity to C5&#8211;20&#8203; alkanes at full polyethylene (PE) conversion under mild conditions (240&#160;&#176;C), with minimal gaseous products (4%). The catalyst reaches a high liquid fuel formation rate of 1274 gliquid&#8203; gNi&#8722;1&#8203; h&#8722;1, rivaling noble metal systems. Its performance is governed by the morphology and crystallinity of NbOx nanorods, which provide sufficient acidity without micropore confinement, mitigating diffusion limitations and over&#8208;cracking. Detailed operando infrared spectroscopy and computational studies reveal, for the first time, that Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated in situ via hydrogen spillover on the (110) facet, are the key catalytic sites in niobium oxide&#8208;based catalysts. The density of these acid sites exhibits a linear correlation with hydrocracking activity. The catalyst also demonstrates high efficiency across diverse polyolefin feedstocks and excellent reusability, offering a scalable and cost&#8208;effective solution for plastic upcycling.

A novel enantiodivergent rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto oxime ethers was enabled by a chiral cobalt complex and a chiral iron complex coordinated with the same ligand.

Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the conformational change of intermediates regulates the lateness of the transition states.








Abstract
A metal&#8208;controlled enantiodivergent rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto oxime ethers has been developed. Switching the metal catalyst from Co(II) to Fe(II) with an identical ligand completely reverses the asymmetric induction. Both enantiomers of chiral 2H&#8208;azirines and its derivatives are accessible under thermal or photolytic conditions. The cobalt&#8208;based reaction is highly efficient even at 0.05 mol% catalyst loading. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments and density functional theory calculations, reveal that distinct electronic properties of cobalt and iron modulate intermediate conformations, thereby altering the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Cooperativity of Electron Transfer Coupled Spin Transitions in a Tetranuclear Fe/Co Prussian Blue Analogue Revealed by Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopies show that irradiation of a square Fe/Co Prussian blue analogue induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast spin crossover, and coupled equilibria between all states trigger a second electron transfer coupled to spin crossover in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit on a ns timescale. This represents a unique case of cooperative two&#8208;step switching on a molecular level.








Abstract
Cooperative intermolecular interactions, usually observed in solid state, can confer useful properties to stimuli&#8211;responsive spin transition materials. Here, we demonstrate for the first time intramolecular cooperativity between the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits of a molecular cyanido&#8208;bridged square Fe2Co2 Prussian blue analogue (PBA) in solution, which upon single photon excitation sequentially undergo electron transfer coupled spin transition (ETCST) from a diamagnetic low&#8208;spin (LS) to a paramagnetic high&#8208;spin (HS) state. Ultrafast UV&#8211;vis and IR pump&#8208;probe spectroscopies show that irradiation into the IVCT band of the LS state induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast (360 fs) SCO to an intermediate HS/LS species and a further ETCST event in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit then occurs on a ns timescale. Kinetic analysis reveals that this cooperative switching of the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits is caused by two coupled equilibria favouring the second ETCST step, and the free energy landscape for the square Fe2Co2 system is determined experimentally.

     alt="Cooperativity of Electron Transfer Coupled Spin Transitions in a Tetranuclear Fe/Co Prussian Blue Analogue Revealed by Ultrafast Spectroscopy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies show that irradiation of a square Fe/Co Prussian blue analogue induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast spin crossover, and coupled equilibria between all states trigger a second electron transfer coupled to spin crossover in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit on a ns timescale. This represents a unique case of cooperative two-step switching on a molecular level.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperative intermolecular interactions, usually observed in solid state, can confer useful properties to stimuli&#8211;responsive spin transition materials. Here, we demonstrate for the first time intramolecular cooperativity between the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits of a molecular cyanido-bridged square Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Prussian blue analogue (PBA) in solution, which upon single photon excitation sequentially undergo electron transfer coupled spin transition (ETCST) from a diamagnetic low-spin (LS) to a paramagnetic high-spin (HS) state. Ultrafast UV&#8211;vis and IR pump-probe spectroscopies show that irradiation into the IVCT band of the LS state induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast (360 fs) SCO to an intermediate HS/LS species and a further ETCST event in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit then occurs on a ns timescale. Kinetic analysis reveals that this cooperative switching of the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits is caused by two coupled equilibria favouring the second ETCST step, and the free energy landscape for the square Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system is determined experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>p&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen in Two&#8208;Dimensional Amorphous RuOx for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In, which facilitates the switch from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. In contrast, doping with other elements, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, results in negligible improvements in catalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing efficient Ru&#8208;based catalysts is crucial in reducing reliance on costly Ir for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, these Ru&#8208;based catalysts face a fundamental stability challenge due to the highly reactive nature of lattice oxygen. In this work, we propose an effective strategy to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In. Notably, Ga doping exhibits remarkable acidic OER performance, leading to a 137&#160;mV reduction in overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 125&#8208;fold improvement in stability compared to undoped RuOx. This also surpasses the performances of most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. In contrast, doping with other elements from the same period, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, shows negligible improvements in catalytic performance. In situ electrochemical spectroscopic analysis, couples with theoretical calculations, reveals that the p&#8211;p orbital hybridization in the Ga&#8211;O coordination within Ga&#8211;RuOx effectively reduces the reactivity of lattice oxygen, suppresses the overoxidation of Ru, and switches the reaction pathway from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This novel p&#8211;p orbital hybridization strategy holds great potential for the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Divergent Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes With Quinones for the Synthesis of Diverse Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions between bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and quinones yield diverse polycyclic molecules. Specifically, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs afford bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, monosubstituted variants undergo cascade transformations to benzoxepines, disubstituted BCBs enable the stereoselective assembly of tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofurans, while strong Lewis acids induce the formation of halogenated cyclobutane derivatives through a ring&#8208;opening reaction.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) are highly strained hydrocarbons with unique structural properties and intrinsic reactivity, making them valuable building blocks for constructing complex molecular architectures. Herein, we report the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed divergent reactions of BCBs with quinones, yielding a diverse array of polycyclic molecules. Using Sc(OTf)&#8323; as a catalyst, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs efficiently undergo formal (3&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition reactions with quinones, producing highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes featuring a caged framework. Monosubstituted BCB ketones undergo a sequential cascade involving Alder&#8208;ene reaction, 4&#960; electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening, and [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction, yielding fused benzoxepines efficiently. Disubstituted BCB esters, ketones, and amides undergo a tandem isomerization and (3&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition process, stereoselectively yielding tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofuran products. Notably, strong Lewis acids such as SnCl&#8324; and BiBr&#8323; directly participate in the ring&#8208;opening reactions of monosubstituted BCB ketones, generating halogenated cyclobutane derivatives. Additionally, the synthetic potential of these approaches has been further highlighted through scale&#8208;up experiments and a range of transformations. This study demonstrates the tunability of reaction pathways based on the diverse substitution patterns of BCBs, providing efficient methods for the synthesis of a range of polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Generation, Capture, Storage, and Release of Singlet Oxygen from a Perylene Diimide&#8208;Based Metallacage for Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop a metallacage capable of generating, capturing, storing, and releasing singlet oxygen through a reversible process. The system also features a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for dissolved oxygen due to reversible photoinduced electron transfer (PET) upon irradiation and heating. This work paves the way for designing metallacage&#8208;based smart materials for diverse photocatalytic and biological applications.








Abstract
The controlled generation and utilization of singlet oxygen (1O2) are crucial for its diverse applications but remain challenging due to its high reactivity and short&#8208;lived nature. Here, we report a box&#8208;shaped metallacage prepared via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using tetrapyridyl perylene diimide (PDI) and tetracarboxylate anthracene as building blocks. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation, the PDI faces act as photosensitizers to generate 1O2, which reacts with the anthracene pillars to form a peroxidized metallacage, where 1O2 is captured and stored as anthracene peroxides. Heating releases 1O2 quantitatively, restoring the original metallacage structure. Both states are stable at room temperature, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Additionally, photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from anthracene pillars to PDI faces quenches the emission of the metallacage, while oxidation of anthracene inhibits PET, yielding bright fluorescence for the peroxidized metallacage. This reversible emission change enables the metallacage to function as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for dissolved oxygen, with a detection limit of 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 mg&#160;L&#8722;1. This study demonstrates a metallacage that can generate, capture, store, and release 1O2 for oxygen sensing, offering insights for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials.

         <title>Bridging the Interlayer Binding to Ordered &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Units for Constructing High&#8208;Performing Light Polarization Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, two cases of alkali metal guanidine&#8208;formates 1Na and 2K were synthesized by combining cationic regulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units, where 1Na maintains large birefringence while overcoming the layered growth habit. The evaluation of 1Na from synthesis to growth to preliminary optical devices was completed, and its optical properties, strong interlayer interaction, and the source of crystal structure stability were analyzed through theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The light polarization modulation involves the capacity to respond selectively to light&#8208;mater interaction and is dependent on the optical anisotropy of crystalline materials. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated component is almost typically utilized to produce such materials in the short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region; however, the conflicting link between high optical anisotropy and strong layered habit is difficult to reconcile. As a result, many anisotropic crystals are limited to tiny crystals rather than processing optical devices. This study designs crystals with beneficial but easy&#8208;to&#8208;grow layered structure and strong optical anisotropy by bridging the interlayer binding to ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. To this end, two new hybrid crystals Na2[C(NH2)3][HCOO]3 (1Na) and K2[C(NH2)3][HCOO]3 (2K) are reported by combining cationic regulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The strong interlayer interaction and stable crystal structure of 1Na have been found to be caused by the orbital hybridization and Lewis acidity of Na+ and [HCOO] groups. This allows for the easy growth of centimeter&#8208;large, high optical quality 1Na single crystals, providing crystal assurance for all&#8208;around testing for a practical crystal. Using the most accurate minimal deviation angle method, the birefringence is measured to be 0.174&#8211;0.258 @253&#8208;1013&#160;nm, surpassing all reported crystals with the same components of [HCOO] or [C(NH2)3] in the applied short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region as well as the corresponding commercial crystals. More importantly, preliminary Glan&#8211;Taylor prism is designed to test its light polarization ability.

     alt="Bridging the Interlayer Binding to Ordered &#960;-Conjugated Units for Constructing High-Performing Light Polarization Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, two cases of alkali metal guanidine-formates 1Na and 2K were synthesized by combining cationic regulation and &#960;-conjugated units, where 1Na maintains large birefringence while overcoming the layered growth habit. The evaluation of 1Na from synthesis to growth to preliminary optical devices was completed, and its optical properties, strong interlayer interaction, and the source of crystal structure stability were analyzed through theoretical calculations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light polarization modulation involves the capacity to respond selectively to light-mater interaction and is dependent on the optical anisotropy of crystalline materials. The &#960;-conjugated component is almost typically utilized to produce such materials in the short-wave ultraviolet region; however, the conflicting link between high optical anisotropy and strong layered habit is difficult to reconcile. As a result, many anisotropic crystals are limited to tiny crystals rather than processing optical devices. This study designs crystals with beneficial but easy-to-grow layered structure and strong optical anisotropy by bridging the interlayer binding to ordered &#960;-conjugated units. To this end, two new hybrid crystals Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][HCOO]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (1Na) and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][HCOO]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2K) are reported by combining cationic regulation and &#960;-conjugated units. The strong interlayer interaction and stable crystal structure of 1Na have been found to be caused by the orbital hybridization and Lewis acidity of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [HCOO] groups. This allows for the easy growth of centimeter-large, high optical quality 1Na single crystals, providing crystal assurance for all-around testing for a practical crystal. Using the most accurate minimal deviation angle method, the birefringence is measured to be 0.174&#8211;0.258 @253-1013&#160;nm, surpassing all reported crystals with the same components of [HCOO] or [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] in the applied short-wave ultraviolet region as well as the corresponding commercial crystals. More importantly, preliminary Glan&#8211;Taylor prism is designed to test its light polarization ability. This work will serve as a guide for future research on innovative short-wave ultraviolet birefringent crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stable Gold Nanoparticles with Tunable Surface Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were achieved through in situ free&#8208;radical polymerization, resulting in a single&#8208;loading structure with controllable morphology and tunable surface properties. The crosslinked polymer shell surrounding the nanoparticles contributes to enhanced stability, excellent biocompatibility, and prolonged blood circulation in mice.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), as a class of functional nanomaterials, have attracted considerable interest for biomedical applications owing to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, colloidal solutions of Au NPs are thermodynamically unstable because of their high surface energy, resulting in poor stability and biocompatibility in physiological environments. Herein, we present a novel strategy for coating Au NPs using in situ polymerization to form a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network polymer shell around each particle. This approach enables the creation of an ultra&#8208;stable core&#8208;shell structure that effectively improves biocompatibility and stability, even in complex biological environments. The surface characteristics of the polymer shell can also be precisely tailored by carefully selecting the monomers to meet biomedical application requirements. These properties enable prolonged circulation within the bloodstream and enhanced tumor targeting in mice. This strategy offers an ultra&#8208;stable, aqueous&#8208;based, and biocompatible polymer shell for Au NPs, paving the way for the surface modification of gold nanomaterials in biomedical applications.

         <title>Taxonomy of Chemical Bondings: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent focus on supramolecular and nanosized systems produced a major increase in the types of observed noncovalent interactions and in the diversity of terms used to designate them. A hierarchical categorization (taxonomy) of terms used to designate electrophile&#183;&#183;&#183;nucleophile interactions is proposed here. Core elements of this classification are some recent IUPAC definitions referring to the electrophile.








Abstract
The concept of the chemical bond is fundamental to chemistry, governing atomic interactions that define all known matter. Despite this central role, the classification and most convenient naming of chemical bonds remain subjects of debate due to the diverse theoretical models and experimental observations. Modelings from quantum mechanical calculations and heuristic principles from experimental observations offer valuable and complementary insights, but sometimes the match and coalescence of these different approaches into a common terminology is not immediate. This paper describes a hierarchical categorization of noncovalent interactions based on the electrophilic atom involved, aligning with IUPAC definitions of hydrogen bonding (HB), halogen bonding (HaB), chalcogen bonding (ChB), and pnictogen bonding (PnB). The resulting taxonomy may avoid some ambiguities that arise from naming interactions based on single chemical/physical features. The proposed categorization that moves from more general and comprehensive terms to more specific and descriptive terms may ensure clarity, comprehensiveness, consistency with periodic trends, and invariancy over evolving understanding of the chemical bonds so that findings can be communicated and stored effectively via both human and machine based protocols.

         <title>Quantitative Tracking of Apopotic Caspase&#8208;3 In Vivo for Early Evaluation of Radiation Therapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, disease&#8208;associated markers are only qualitatively imaged  in&#8208;vivo by conventional probes in an activated on/off mode. However, accurate quantification of markers (especially protease&#8217;s dynamic concentration) in real&#8208;time in&#8208;vivo remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we developed a protease activated ratiometric fluorescent (FL) probe that emits both reference and responsive signals at 1550 nm, enabling the accurate quantification of disease&#8208;associated protease in&#8208;vivo after administration into living organisms. This probe was fabricated by conjugating FL molecules with Ln3+&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles throughout a substrate peptide of caspase&#8208;3. Caspase&#8208;3 induces a response signal while ensuring a consistent reference signal, resulting in a ratiometric signal with a linear correlation with the caspase&#8208;3 concentration and a limit of detection of 9.96 U/mL. An early efficacy assessment system established accordingly can predict the cancer therapeutic effect within 12 h after treatment, which would otherwise require several days or weeks to become evident, thus guiding the optimization of the therapeutic regimen. Thus, the ratiometric NIR&#8208;II FL probe holds the potential for advancing from qualitative imaging to quantitative detection by enabling the in&#8208;situ quantification of disease markers.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO in 100%: The Synergistic Effect of Nickel and Europiumin Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic transition&#8208;rare earth metal (3d&#8208;4f) clusters with synergestic catalytic activity are rarely identified. Herein, two families of closely related 3d&#8208;Eu clusters were designed to analyze the role of Eu(III) ions during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO. The [M24Eu8] family, where M = Co or Ni, shows much lower activity (CO production &lt; 2078 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) compared to the [M24Eu10] family (CO production &gt; 5838 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). This is due to the two additional Eu(III) ions in the apical position of the latter which are very active for converting CO2 into CO. Moreover, we found the nickel analogues are better than the cobalt ones, especially for [Ni24Eu10] which exhibits 100 % CO selectivity and very high efficacy of 6545.3 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, while the [Co24Eu10] only shows 55 % CO selectivity. Therefore, the coexistence of both apical Eu(III) and Ni(II) ions has been experimentally revealed to be critical for this exceptional catalytic performance of the [Ni24Eu10] cluster. As such, this work unambiguously reveals a synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts and may open a new avenue for more sophisticated reaction design by using the heterometallic coordination clusters</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Single&#8208;Atom Site to Dual&#8208;Atom Site in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts: A Universal Strategy for Enhancing Durability in Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits highly active, selective, and strong H2O2 decomposition capability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. 








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising non&#8208;noble metal oxygen reduction catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, their practical applications are still limited by unsatisfactory long&#8208;term stability. This is because the N atoms of the active FeN4 moiety are easy to protonate, leading to the leaching of Fe atoms, and the H2O2 generated during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process triggers the Fenton reaction, further accelerating the dissolution of Fe. To address these critical stability challenge, we developed a general strategy to transform FeN4 single&#8208;atom sites to Fe2N6 dual&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. This is achieved by treating the presynthesized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in a H2/Ar atmosphere to break the C&#9472;N bonds near the FeN4 sites while introducing Fe and N precursors to form the Fe2N6 sites. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the newly formed Fe2N6 sites are structurally more stable in acidic ORR and produce negligible H2O2 (&lt;1%). Therefore, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits an extremely low Fe demetalation ratio (0.61 at%) in 0.1&#160;M HClO4 after 80k cycling. More surprisingly, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst can effectively decompose H2O2 with a high decomposition rate of 15.7&#160;mmol min&#8722;1, approaching that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Pt/C catalyst (17&#160;mmol min&#8722;1). As a result, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst assembled PEMFC operates stably for 300&#160;h with only 7% current density attenuation, whereas that of the pristine Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst&#8208;based device declines by 84% within 100&#160;h.

     alt="Transforming Single-Atom Site to Dual-Atom Site in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts: A Universal Strategy for Enhancing Durability in Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work develops a general strategy to transform FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom sites to Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dual-atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits highly active, selective, and strong H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition capability for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising non-noble metal oxygen reduction catalyst for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, their practical applications are still limited by unsatisfactory long-term stability. This is because the N atoms of the active FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moiety are easy to protonate, leading to the leaching of Fe atoms, and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generated during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process triggers the Fenton reaction, further accelerating the dissolution of Fe. To address these critical stability challenge, we developed a general strategy to transform FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom sites to Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dual-atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with various carbon substrates. This is achieved by treating the presynthesized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ar atmosphere to break the C&#9472;N bonds near the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites while introducing Fe and N precursors to form the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sites. Our theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the newly formed Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sites are structurally more stable in acidic ORR and produce negligible H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;lt;1%). Therefore, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits an extremely low Fe demetalation ratio (0.61 at%) in 0.1&#160;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; after 80k cycling. More surprisingly, the transformed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst can effectively decompose H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a high decomposition rate of 15.7&#160;mmol min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, approaching that of the state-of-the art Pt/C catalyst (17&#160;mmol min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Multiactivity of Nanozyme Liposome Regulates the Homeostasis of Biochemical Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biomimetic liposome (CeO2@M) with nanozyme multiactivity to regulate the homeostasis of microenvironment. Artificial liposomes with negatively charged liposomes, like endothelial membranes, reduce blood component adhesion. The CeO2 nanozyme hydrolyzes ATP/ADP, lessening platelet aggregation, and regulates the level of biochemical factors such as ROS to maintain the homeostasis of the microenvironment for tissue regeneration.








Abstract
In living systems, cascade reactions involving multiple enzymes, critical for regulating the biochemical microenvironment's homeostasis, are essential to transplantation remodeling. However, for ready&#8208;to&#8208;use purposes, designing and constructing therapeutic liposomes that replicate natural cell functions during the initial transplantation phase remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology for tissue engineering. Herein, we developed a biomimetic liposome with multienzymatic nanozyme activity to regulate proinflammatory factors induced by exogenous implants. The liposomes were fabricated through the self&#8208;assembly of artificial membranes on CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). These membranes, featuring a negatively charged surface analogous to endothelial cell (EC) membranes, effectively attenuate blood component adhesion and aggregation. The CeO2 nanozyme not only hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), reducing subsequent platelet aggregation, but also regulates biochemical microenvironment homeostasis, thereby promoting tissue regeneration. This work advances the development of cell&#8208;like entities capable of modulating signaling communication between living and abiotic interfaces.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Ordering Outperforms Coordination Effects in Governing Oxygen Reduction Catalysis on High&#8208;Index Nickel Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study explored the link between ferromagnetic ordering, coordination number, and ORR activity in nickel single&#8208;crystal foils. We found that Ni (210) facets outperform Ni (310) and Ni (520) due to higher saturation magnetization and optimized d&#8208;band positioning. DFT calculations confirmed that ferromagnetic ordering, not surface coordination, drives catalytic performance by enhancing spin polarization and lowering energy barriers. External magnetic fields further boosted the activity of Ni foils.








Abstract
The role of surface spin configuration in spin&#8208;dependent catalytic reactions remains contentious, particularly when compared to the established dominance of coordination environments. Here, we resolve this debate by systematically probing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanisms on high&#8208;index Ni single&#8208;crystal facets ([210], [310], [520]) through integrated density functional theory (DFT) and experimental studies. Contrary to conventional d&#8208;band center predictions, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic ordering fundamentally dictates catalytic activity by stabilizing triplet O2 adsorption and lowering spin&#8208;forbidden transition barriers. The Ni (210) facet exhibits superior ORR performance (half&#8208;wave potential: 0.842&#160;V vs. RHE), outperforming Ni (310) and Ni (520) due to its optimized d&#8208;band center and enhanced saturation magnetization. External magnetic fields amplify this effect, yielding a 28% current density enhancement for Ni (210)&#8212;nearly triple that of Ni (520). Spin&#8208;polarized DFT calculations reveal that ferromagnetic ordering reduces the potential&#8208;determining step energy barrier for *OH desorption by 7.0%, overriding coordination&#8208;number effects. These findings establish ferromagnetic alignment as a critical design criterion for spin&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, offering a paradigm shift from coordination&#8208;centric optimization to spin&#8208;polarized interface engineering.

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Driven by Efficient Nitrate Reduction via Bimetallic Iron/Zinc Polyphthalocyanine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks enable highly efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia. When integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, this reaction facilitates rapid salt ion mass transfer, allowing the conversion of natural seawater into drinkable water and simultaneously converting nitrate contaminants into a useful chemical.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity and nitrate contamination in water sources are critical environmental sustainability challenges. We address these two challenges by coupling seawater desalination with electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) via bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks. They serve as high&#8208;performance catalysts for NO3RR toward ammonia (NH3) production. The efficient NO3RR is integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, enabling the production of freshwater from seawater and the removal of nitrate from contaminated water. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that Zn&#8208;N4 units incorporated into the Fe polyphthalocyanine framework modulate Fe&#8208;N4 sites&#8217;&#160;d&#8208;band center to enhance the adsorption of NO3&#8722; and the generation of *H, resulting in 3.22 times higher turnover frequency and highly selective reduction toward NH3. The optimized Fe8Zn1PPc delivered NH3 Faradic efficiency (&gt;97% over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.95&#160;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), the NH3 yield rate of 2.68&#160;mmol h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus RHE, and over 120&#160;h of stable operation, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts for NO3RR. The desalination device achieves the highest salt removal rates (1326.92&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 min&#8722;1) among various desalination methods. Ten cycles of natural seawater desalination to drinking water are demonstrated with 99% ion removal. This work presents an innovative solution for addressing sustainable water challenges.

The desalination device achieves the highest salt removal rates (1326.92&#160;&#181;g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) among various desalination methods. Ten cycles of natural seawater desalination to drinking water are demonstrated with 99% ion removal.

         <title>Modular Access to P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of (Thio)Phosphonic Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy using newly modified chiral PIM ligands enables modular access to diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with high stereocontrol. This approach tolerates broad functionality, constructs challenging P&#9552;S motifs, and enables late&#8208;stage nucleoside derivatization, providing a versatile platform for drug and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutic development.








Abstract
Chiral phosphorus(V) centers&#8212;particularly those bearing fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted frameworks&#8212;are key stereochemical motifs in pharmaceuticals, nucleic acid therapeutics, and functional materials. However, their stereoselective construction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy enabled by rationally engineered PIM ligands that affords broad and modular access to structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds. By harnessing the tunable Lewis acidity and well&#8208;defined chiral environment of the catalyst&#8212;together with the distinct mechanistic features of chiral Lewis acid catalysis&#8212;this strategy overcomes the substrate scope limitations that have constrained traditional approaches. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and delivers high levels of stereocontrol across seven distinct substitution patterns, including the efficient construction of chiral P&#9552;S motifs previously considered synthetically challenging. Importantly, the approach enables efficient late&#8208;stage derivatization of nucleosides and their analogs, thereby providing a general entry point to stereodefined P(V)&#8208;containing bioactive molecules. This work not only expands the utility of transition&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis in phosphorus chemistry, but also establishes a versatile framework for applications in drug discovery and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics where precise stereochemical control is essential.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Ratchet Mechanism Accelerates Regioselective Metal&#8208;Cation Exchange in a Heterobimetallic Helicate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates form with high diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity via single&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly or self&#8208;sorting. White&#8208;light exposure autonomously operates one helicate as a molecular ratchet, promoting the selective formation of an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium structure. This ratchet mechanism furthermore accelerates regioselective metal&#8208;cation exchange from a homometallic to a heterometallic helicate.








Abstract
Molecular machines rely on their capacity to exploit non&#8208;equilibrium processes to perform work. However, the development of these non&#8208;equilibrium processes, such as molecular ratchets, is still in its early stages. Here, we report a diazocine&#8208;containing ligand (L) harbouring two distinct chelating coordination sites that can self&#8208;sort into dinuclear homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates ([FeII2L](OTf)4, [CoII2L](OTf)4, [ZnII2L](OTf)4, [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4, [ZnIICoIIL](OTf)4) with precisely controlled metal cation distribution. The photoisomerisation of the helicates operates via a molecular ratchet mechanism, resulting in metastable diastereomers that shift the system from thermodynamic equilibrium. Continuous white&#8208;light irradiation autonomously drives this ratchet process, selectively enriching an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pseudo&#8208;mesocate structure. Crucially, the ratchet mechanism can significantly accelerate metal&#8208;cation exchange from the [ZnII2L](OTf)4 helicate to the [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4 helicate. Thus, the system operates in a manner reminiscent of a &#8220;claw machine&#8221;, selectively seizing FeII ions when subjected to a precisely controllable external stimulus. These findings lay the foundation for creating adaptive and reconfigurable supramolecular structures that use non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena on a molecular level.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Alternating Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with Tunable Properties Enabled by Substitution Effects and Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structurally diversity were synthesized by a &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8208;repolymerization&#8221; strategy. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. 








Abstract
The development of innovative poly(ether&#8208;ester)s with perfectly alternating ether and ester functionalities to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. Herein, we prepared a series of enantiopure cyclic thioether&#8208;ester monomers bearing various pendant substituents by a facile &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8221; strategy. The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers will afford stereoregular poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structural diversity. The varieties of substituent size, position and stereo&#8208;configuration provide the opportunity to systematically investigate polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as structure&#8208;properties relationship for the resulting poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. Of note, these polymers can be chemically recycled by either ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or alcoholysis, with high monomer regeneration efficiency. The systematic investigation of substitution effects and structure&#8208;property relationships in this work provides a molecular blueprint for designing novel chemically recyclable polymers with high performance.

         <title>Nature of Anti&#8208;Dissipative High&#8208;Energy Excited States in Quaterpyridine&#8208;Bridged Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoexcitation, meta&#8208;connected quaterpyridine&#8208;bridged Ru complexes undergo fast inter&#8208;ligand electron transfer like typical chromophores, but unusually slow intra&#8208;ligand electron transfer within bridge&#8208;centered MLCT states. The energy saved was exploited for photoreductions and photooxidations with model electron donors and acceptors, respectively. Design guidelines involving ancillary&#8208;ligand substitution and bridge topology were derived.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy excited states with slow rates for internal conversion to the lowest&#8208;energy excited state are prone to be intercepted before they dissipate energy to the medium. In a previous report, oligomeric Ru(II) photosensitizers bearing a bridging 2,2&#8242;:5&#8242;,3&#8243;:6&#8243;,2&#8244;&#8211;quaterpyridine scaffold showed promising anti&#8208;dissipative behavior in photoinduced electron transfer reactivity. In here, a range of electron accepting and electron donating substituents were incorporated on the ancillary 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands to modulate the excited&#8208;state dynamics. This allowed to unambiguously identify the nature of high&#8208;energy excited states and derive design guidelines for the achievement of anti&#8208;dissipative behavior in oligomeric Ru(II) polypyridines relevant for solar fuels production and photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Electrolytes with Tailored Solvent&#8211;Solvent Interactions for Flame&#8208;Retardant Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work, by introducing solvent&#8211;solvent interactions, achieves an ion&#8208;aggregate&#8208;rich solvation structure at low concentrations, promoting the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, effectively suppressing the reaction between trimethyl phosphate and the sodium metal anode, thereby enabling stable cycling of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs), which possess abundant sodium resources and high energy density, have attracted widespread attention. However, the continuous reaction between the electrolyte and the sodium metal anode, along with the formation of an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), leads to rapid capacity decay and the safety hazard of potential ignition. In this work, designing a low&#8208;cost and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte with solvent&#8211;solvent interactions is achieved by introducing sodium&#8208;difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) as a single salt into the ester&#8208;based electrolyte on the basis of trimethyl phosphate. Theoretical research combined with experimental study disclose through the solvent&#8211;solvent interactions, an ion&#8208;aggregate&#8208;rich solvation structure is formed at low concentrations, leading to the formation of a gradient SEI enriched with inorganic compounds such as B and F on the anode. This effectively suppresses interfacial reactions and sodium dendrite growth, significantly improving the cycling stability along with the optimizing the safety of SMBs. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery using this electrolyte maintains a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93% after 5000 cycles (320 days) at 1C. This approach provides a reliable solution for the application of flame&#8208;retardant electrolytes in SMBs, which also sheds light on the designing principle of advanced battery systems.

         <title>Highly Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant and Self&#8208;Adaptive Surface&#8208;Initiated Bimetal&#8208;Mediated Controlled Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel and versatile self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional polymer brushes under ambient conditions with exceptional oxygen tolerance. By introducing a bimetal CuZn alloy, the system self&#8208;adaptively regulates the dissociation of copper species, ensuring robust and controllable polymer brush growth across a wide range of distances between the bimetallic alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate.








Abstract
We report herein a self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (SI&#8208;BMCRP) for fabricating various polymer brushes using microliter volumes under ambient conditions. The introduction of bimetal CuZn alloy can self&#8208;adaptively control the dissociation of copper species while still realizing the controllability of polymer brush growth with high oxygen tolerance at a wide range of distances between the bimetal alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate. The successful fabrication of multiscale and multifunctional polymer brushes with high&#8208;end group fidelity and patterned architectures further demonstrates the robust nature of SI&#8208;BMCRP. The resultant polymer brushes show great potential for new applications in moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation, breath monitoring, and speech recognition.

         <title>ABC&#8208;seq Expands Small RNAs Profiling with Successive Nucleic Acid Structure&#8208;Differentiated Enzymatic Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce ABC&#8208;seq, a versatile smRNA&#8208;seq method addressing challenges in library construction, such as adapter ligation biases, dimer byproducts, and amplification bias. ABC&#8208;seq employs successive enhanced recognition for smRNAs and integrates randomized adapters as UMIs for precise quantification, leveraging nucleic acid structural differences between smRNAs libraries and adapter dimers, supported by robust validation and biological data.








Abstract
Small RNAs (smRNAs) play crucial roles in gene regulation, but current sequencing methods face a set of tangled challenges, including adapter ligation bias, high adapter dimer byproducts, and amplification variability, which limit their capacity to fully capture smRNA diversity. Here, we develop ABC&#8208;seq, a general strategy to enhance smRNA recognition through successive structure&#8208;differentiated recognition. We designed two randomized adapters, each containing a restriction enzyme recognition motif or a cleavage site. Then, we operate two product structure&#8208;differentiated enzymatic reactions to maximally suppress randomized adapter dimer. Furthermore, the randomized sequence in adapters serves as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in smRNA&#8208;seq data analysis to correct amplification bias and improves quantification accuracy. Using ABC&#8208;seq, we identified a wider range of smRNAs, including miRNAs, scRNAs, and snoRNAs, in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, detecting 9.4% more miRNAs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, ABC&#8208;seq revealed smRNAs associated with cancer drug responses and their roles in immune modulation in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer. ABC&#8208;seq expands the smRNA landscape and offers new insights into complex gene regulatory networks.

         <title>Operando XAFS Deciphering Dynamic Evolution of Heteronuclear Cu&#8211;Ni From Atomic Sites to Atomic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the intrinsic potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction of Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear sites during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Through operando XAFS and microscopy, we reveal the potential&#8208;driven transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7). The tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs effectively reduce the occupancy of Cu 3d&#8211;C 2p antibonding orbitals, thereby promoting CO2 protonation and significantly accelerating eCO2RR kinetics.








Abstract
Revealing the dynamic evolution of atomic&#8208;level active sites during catalytic reactions is critical for identifying true catalytic centers and optimizing the adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, elucidating the dynamic atomic/electronic transformation mechanisms of metal sites in multimetallic systems and achieving atomic&#8208;level control remains challenging. Here, we report a potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction intrinsic to Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear atomic sites during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and microscopy unveil the transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7) at potentials from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.2&#160;V versus RHE, anchored on porous carbon through N/S coordination. The Cu&#8208;rich evolution reshapes geometric structures of active sites, inducing gradual electron localization, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy of CO2 intermediates as evidenced by operando measurements and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs formed at &#8722;0.9&#160;V reduce the antibonding orbital occupancy between Cu 3d and C 2p states, facilitating CO2 protonation and enhancing eCO2RR kinetics. These findings demonstrate high CO selectivity and catalytic stability, providing fundamental insights into the dynamic reconstruction and catalytic mechanism of atomic&#8208;scale active sites.

         <title>Merging One&#8208; and Multi&#8208;Photon Processes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Enhanced NIR Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal and Photochemical Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a paradigm for the development of highly stable and multifunctional HOF materials to enable the full&#8208;spectrum utilization of sunlight, which is achieved through a dual&#8208;process mechanism involving one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitations, facilitated by direct absorption of NIR light within a single HOF platform, for synergistically enhanced performance in photothermal, photochemical, and chiroptical applications.








Abstract
Direct application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for solar&#8208;thermal and solar&#8208;chemical conversions is of emergent interest to improving efficiency in solar&#8208;energy utilization. Herein, we report a synthetic approach to NIR&#8208;responsive materials by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;1/2/3) from multifunctionalized Ru&#8208;components incorporating chiral, photoactive, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;stacking, and protonation/deprotonation subunits. Significantly, protonation of the imidazole&#8208;subunits in HOF&#8208;3 promotes densified packing to extend NIR absorption tail up to 1100&#160;nm with a narrowed bandgap of 1.41&#160;eV, meanwhile leads to spontaneous resolution of enantiomeric &#916;&#8208;/&#923;&#8208;HOF&#8208;3. Consequently, remarkably enhanced photothermal effect and photocatalytic performance, including chiroptical activity induced by circularly polarized NIR light, are achieved through synergy of direct one&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon NIR absorption, underscoring effectiveness to bring multifunctionalities into ordered HOFs for generation of robust and effective materials with multimode NIR responsiveness.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Cathode Constructed Solely by Carbon Dots for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots are solely applied as the active cathode material in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries for the first time, which exhibit decent cycling performance, excellent capacity retention, and ultrahigh ion diffusion ability.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have been explored widely in the electrochemistry field, owing to their unique structures and rich properties. However, in the reported devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, CDs are always used as additives to modify the electrodes or regulate the electrolytes because they have been regarded as inert and low&#8208;capacity materials all along. Here, for the first time, o&#8208;phenylenediamine derived CDs are selected as the only protagonist to construct cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such CDs (p&#8208;CDs) have a special &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenazine&#8208;based structure, with carbon cores for electrical conductivity and active sites for embedding Zn2+ and H+. The p&#8208;CDs solely constructed cathode material delivers a superior capacity of 290&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and a decent capacity of 103&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 10&#160;A g&#8722;1, as well as an ultrahigh ion diffusion coefficient of 10&#8722;8&#160;&#8764;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;cm2 s&#8722;1. The p&#8208;CDs assembled ZIBs exhibit a stable long&#8208;term cycling, retaining 87.4% of the original capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles. Various characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the electron&#8208;deficient N as the active sites on p&#8208;CDs can embed/release Zn2+ and H+ reversibly.

         <title>Location&#8208;Differentiated DNA Hierarchical Cyclic Construction Demarcating Identical Biomolecules Across Cell Membrane Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial demarcation of identical biomolecules across distinct cell membrane microenvironments has not been well determined. Here we report location&#8208;differentiated DNA hierarchical cyclic construction for lipid raft&#8208;differentiated spatial profiling in living cells. It can differentially visualize identical biomolecules inside and outside lipid rafts, and quantitatively measures molecule distribution rate (lipid raft to the whole cell membrane).








Abstract
Local molecular composition across cell membrane microenvironments exerts profound effects on cellular physiology and pathology. Yet spatial demarcation of identical biomolecules inside and outside lipid raft microdomains has not been determined. Here we report location&#8208;differentiated DNA hierarchical cyclic construction for lipid raft&#8208;differentiated spatial profiling of identical biomolecules in living cells. It contains two sequential DNA cyclic construction reactions: primary one triggered by total target molecules and secondary one activated by lipid raft's location markers proximal to target molecules. Using this method, we differentially visualize identical biomolecules localized in lipid raft and non&#8208;lipid raft microdomains with different signals. We demonstrate the robustness and universality of this method by testing cell surface RNAs and proteins in diverse cell types. We reveal their diverse spatial demarcation with intrinsic heterogeneity. In both lipid raft&#8208;disrupting cells and senescent cells, MUC1 protein is dynamically organized between these two microdomains. Our strategy provides a promising avenue to investigate physiological and pathological functions of dynamic molecular compositions across cellular microenvironments.

         <title>Tunable Oxygen Vacancy Clusters Enhanced Catalytic Activity of CeO2 Nanorods on CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and halogen&#8208;free strategy for CO2 cycloaddition is achieved using CeO2 nanorods enriched with oxygen vacancy clusters. The Ce3+ ions and lattice oxygens in the vicinity of the vacancy clusters construct abundant frustrated Lewis pair sites, which boost substrate adsorption and activation, reduce reaction energy barriers, stabilize intermediates, and accelerate product desorption.








Abstract
Constructing heterogeneous halogen&#8208;free catalysts featuring efficiently activated CO2 and epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via an atom&#8208;economical route is significant but remains a big challenge. In this work, we develop an atmosphere&#8208;assisted strategy for preparing mesoporous CeO2 nanorods with tunable oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations, which boosts the performance of CO2 cycloaddition. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis elucidates that oxygen vacancy clusters regulate the dynamic equilibrium of the multiscale structure of CeO2 via a synergistic &#8220;compression&#8208;expansion&#8221; mechanism. Furthermore, the high concentrations of oxygen vacancy clusters form abundant frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) sites, which remarkably promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 with epoxides. Thus, the performance of CO2 cycloaddition was substantially intensified. A 95% yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when the reaction was conducted with RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 at 110&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the kinetic properties and the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition on FLP sites in RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 were investigated based on the in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts with tunable FLP sites for the efficient activation and conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals by modulating oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations.

         <title>Azine&#8208;Pyridine Frame Generated Covalent Organic Frameworks and Self&#8208;Polymerized Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a family of azine&#8208;pyridine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that promote proton and electron transport through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. These COFs exhibit thermochromism, self&#8208;assemble into meter&#8208;scale films, and show enhanced heavy metal ion reduction, UV shielding, and battery performance, offering new opportunities in reticular chemistry, environmental science, and energy storage.








Abstract
Engineering covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into industrializable films with inherent functionalities has remained a major challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, through developing skeletal azine&#8208;pyridine conformation, we present an effectual synthetic frame to convert a family of powdery COFs into self&#8208;polymerized COFs films under green and ambient conditions. The active proton tautomerism in our azine&#8208;pyridine frame offers a thermochromism, facilitating self&#8208;polymerization of large&#8208;area COFs films from ca. 10&#160;nm to &gt;30&#160;&#181;m thickness with outstanding chemical stability, industrializable processability, and mechanical strength. More remarkably, our azine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based COFs first display various fresh properties, i.e., up to 1913 and 624&#160;mg g&#8722;1 reducing capacities on ions of Au3+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Au0 and Cr6+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Cr3+, 99.9% UV&#8208;blue light shielding and 97.2% transmissivity of visible lights and 10&#8208;fold increase in Zn battery lifetime. We expect that the azine&#8208;pyridine synthetic frame will serve as a generalizable route to boost the development of reticular chemistry, environmental science, and nano&#8208;electronics.

The active proton tautomerism in our azine-pyridine frame offers a thermochromism, facilitating self-polymerization of large-area COFs films from ca. 10&#160;nm to &amp;gt;30&#160;&#181;m thickness with outstanding chemical stability, industrializable processability, and mechanical strength. More remarkably, our azine-pyridine-based COFs first display various fresh properties, i.e., up to 1913 and 624&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; reducing capacities on ions of Au&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&#8594;&#160;Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&#8594;&#160;Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, 99.9% UV-blue light shielding and 97.2% transmissivity of visible lights and 10-fold increase in Zn battery lifetime. We expect that the azine-pyridine synthetic frame will serve as a generalizable route to boost the development of reticular chemistry, environmental science, and nano-electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simple and Rapid Tumor EV Enrichment Enabled by Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided Entanglement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective isolation of extracellular vesicle (EV) subpopulations is essential for their biomedical applications. We present a simple, rapid, and versatile strategy termed LODGE (Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided EV Entanglement) for the enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from biofluids. LODGE facilitates the application of tEVs in biomarker discovery, therapeutic agents, and disease diagnosis, as evidenced by proteomic profiling, bioactivity assays, and cancer classification.








Abstract
Specific subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold significant clinical potential for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic agents. However, this field remains underutilized due to the lack of straightforward and versatile techniques for isolating EV subpopulations from biofluids. Here, we present LODGE, a long DNA probe&#8208;guided EV entanglement strategy for the simple, rapid, and selective enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from clinical specimens. LODGE uses two long DNA affinity probes to recognize specific subpopulations, causing them to aggregate with the assistance of splint strands, thereby achieving nondestructive, high&#8208;yield, and high&#8208;purity separation of tEVs within a short period. Proteomic analysis revealed that the isolated tEVs contributed to the identification of tumor&#8208;associated biomarkers compared to total EVs. Additionally, by incorporating a split G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;containing molecular trap domain, a novel structure that significantly improves the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T (ThT), into DNA affinity probes, we developed an innovative LODGE&#8208;ThT sensing strategy for the highly sensitive profiling of multiple tEV subpopulations. Using data from the tEVs alongside clinical indicators processed with machine learning algorithms, we effectively classified five tumor types. Our results show that LODGE is a promising tool for identifying specific EV subpopulations, and fostering their biomedical applications.

         <title>Resiquimod&#8208;Induced Nanovaccine (RINV) for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the dual roles of resiquimod (R848) as both an immune stimulant and a structural unit, this study conjugates R848 onto fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer to develop an antigen carrier G5&#8208;R848. G5&#8208;R848 forms stable nanovaccines with OVA model antigen or tumor lysates and facilitates cytosolic antigen delivery. The nanovaccines demonstrate potent DCs maturation and cross&#8208;presentation and elicit significantly increased tumor antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell responses.








Abstract
Cancer nanovaccines have emerged as a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy due to their capability of eliciting robust tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. However, structural complexity and insufficient spatiotemporal coordination of immune activation pose substantial challenges for optimizing the therapeutic potential of nanovaccines. Herein, a resiquimod&#8208;induced nanovaccine (RINV) is devised for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) was covalently conjugated to fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer through a disulfide linker to obtain the vaccine carrier G5&#8208;R848. In this design, R848 not only fulfills its biological role as a vaccine adjuvant but facilitates uniform nanovaccine formation with the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) due to its distinctive chemical structure. Redox&#8208;triggered intracellular R848 release further promotes cytosolic delivery of antigen and subsequent antigen cross&#8208;presentation. In vivo studies demonstrated that the nanovaccine induces remarkable prophylactic and therapeutic effects in the B16F10&#8208;OVA melanoma model. Moreover, G5&#8208;R848 forms personalized nanovaccines by complexing with cell lysates from resected B16F10 and 4T1 tumor tissues, effectively inhibiting postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Encapsulating Ionophores in Zeolite Imidazolate Framework&#8208;8 for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Ion Fluctuations in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, ionophore was encapsulated in zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticle for long&#8208;term ion recognition with high stability. The mechanical mismatch between implanted electrodes and brain tissue was addressed by sputtering gold nanoparticles (AuNP) on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers as a flexible electrode substrate. This study provides a versatile strategy for developing ion&#8208;selective microsensors that well meet the demands of long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring.








Abstract
Various ions in the brain (e.g., H+, K+, and Ca2+) play essential roles in neural information transmission and physiopathological processes. Real&#8208;time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long&#8208;term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion&#8208;selective microsensor for long&#8208;term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long&#8208;term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer&#8208;based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Hollow Microreactors with Catalytic Nanobrushes for Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated living CDSA endows the engineering of the surface of hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures and enables specific inner&#8208;outer spatial isolation of various catalytic species on tailored microreactor. Notably, the microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes and internal Pt&#8208;Ni alloys revealed prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine (95.4% sel.).








Abstract
Micro/nanoreactors with hollow structures have traditionally focused on the design of the internal catalytic microenvironment, while precise engineering of their external surfaces at a nanoscale level is particularly rare. Here, we develop a unique approach to elaborately engineer the surface of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;based hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures that serve as an external catalytic platform. This involves the anchoring of high&#8208;density micellar brushes onto the epidermis of ZIF&#8208;8 via surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, followed by the rapid capture of multiple species to fabricate the catalytic nanobrushes. Such a nanoscale fluff&#8208;like surface in combination with an internal cavity that encapsulates other functional components enables specific spatial isolation of various catalysts. The resultant microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes for esterification and internal Pt&#9472;Ni alloys for hydrogenation reveals prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine with a high selectivity of 95.4%. Remarkably, the microreactor decorated with PW12 nanobrushes can greatly prompt the catalytic efficiency of esterification with the inhibited competition from the hydrogenation reaction. Overall, this work provides an innovative guidance for the rational creation of multifunctional microreactors with fine surface nanostructures.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides feature significant potential for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) but encounter insufficient C2+ selectivity primarily due to the inherent symmetric charge distribution at Cu sites hindering asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling. Here we report a unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with&#160;asymmetric,&#160;corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs to boost asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst of La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, their ordered, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 pyramids and CuO6 octahedra feature localized charge density redistribution, creating abundant asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites with distinct electronic structures and also strengthening Cu&#8208;O covalency. In CO2RR (in both alkaline and acidic media), La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; greatly promotes C2+ formation while producing negligible CH4, showing a Faradaic efficiency ratio (C2+ to CH4) of up to 180. Moreover, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, achieving a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 85.0% at 400 mA cm&#8208;2, together with well&#8208;boosted stability, outperforms previously reported Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalysts. Our experiments and theoretical calculations attribute the superb performance mainly to the following factors: the asymmetric CuO5&#8208;CuO6 sites promoting differentiated *CO adsorption/hydrogenation to favor asymmetric *CO&#8208;*CHO coupling; the strengthened Cu&#8208;O covalency stabilizing the Cu sites. Extending this strategy to two additional pairs of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides generates similarly successful results.</dc:description>

The &#8220;pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#8221; electrolyte employs the amide polymer encapsulation matrix (APEM) to construct localized charge&#8208;transfer channels toward solvents, tuning the negative charge center. The APEM promotes cation&#8208;anion coordination in the primary solvation sheath, establishing the AGGs&#8208;dominated interface, thereby achieving excellent wide&#8208;temperature performance (&#8722;40&#8764;80&#160;&#176;C) and high energy density (490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).








Abstract
Electric vehicles and electric aircraft demand all&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, the interaction mechanism between charge transfer in the solvation sheath and interfacial evolution is not yet clear. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#8221; strategy by introducing an amide polymer encapsulation matrix (APEM) to construct local charge&#8208;transfer channels to solvents for tuning the negative charge center. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron X&#8208;ray tomography reveal that the APEM drags out the polar solvent and promotes cation&#8208;anion coordination in the primary solvation sheath, contributing to AGGs&#8208;dominated interfacial solvation chemistry. The designed electrolyte improves the cyclability of Li|LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 up to 300 cycles at 4.6&#160;V and high&#8208;temperature capability at 80&#160;&#176;C. Even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, it still delivers a high capacity of 87.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with negligible capacity decay for 160 cycles. Industrial 3&#160;Ah&#8208;level pouch cells over 490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 exhibit 91.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles, manifesting high potential in extreme applications.

         <title>Automated Iterative N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated iterative assembly of MIDA or TIDA boronate building blocks enables generalized and automated preparation of many different types of small functional molecules in a modular fashion. However, until now, this engine could not leverage nitrogen atoms as iteration handles, excluding molecules rich in N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bonds. Here, we disclose a new iteration&#8208;enabling group, CbzT, that reversibly attenuates the reactivity of nitrogen atoms and enables generalized catch&#8208;and&#8208;release purification. Leveraging CbzT, we achieve the automated modular synthesis of Imatinib (Gleevec), a widely used drug. This work substantially expands the range of small molecules that can be synthesized using automated block chemistry.








Abstract
Small molecule solutions to many contemporary societal challenges await discovery, but the artisanal and manual process via which this class of chemical matter is typically accessed limits the discovery of new functions. Automated assembly of (N&#8208;methyl iminodiacetic acid) MIDA or (tetramethyl N&#8208;methyl iminodiacetic acid) TIDA boronate building blocks via iterative C&#9472;C bond formation, an approach we call &#8220;block chemistry&#8221;, alternatively enables generalized and automated preparation of many different types of small molecules in a modular fashion. But in its current form, this engine cannot also leverage nitrogen atoms as iteration handles. Here, we disclose a new iteration&#8208;enabling group, CbzT (p&#8208;TIDA boronate&#8208;substituted carboxybenzyl), that reversibly attenuates the reactivity of nitrogen atoms and enables generalized catch&#8208;and&#8208;release purification. CbzT is leveraged to achieve the automated modular synthesis of Imatinib (Gleevec), an archetypical clinically approved kinase inhibitor, in which building blocks are iteratively linked by both N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bonds. This work substantially expands the types of small molecules that can be iteratively assembled in an automated modular fashion. It also advances the concept of intentionally developing chemistry that machines can do.

         <title>Zwitterionic Heavier Pnictinidenes in Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic pnictinidenes: A new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species stabilized by bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate ligands is reported, enabling the isolation of Sb and Bi in multiple oxidation states. These thoroughly characterized systems exhibit cationic character and engage in redox catalysis, facilitating catalytic hydrodefluorination and dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes, expanding the scope of main group redox chemistry.








Abstract
Herein, we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low&#8208;valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Access to P&#8208;Chiral Triarylphosphine Oxides via Insertion of P&#9472;H Bonds into Diazonaphthoquinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric insertion of P&#9472;H bond into carbene has been developed to access P&#8208;chiral phosphine oxides in excellent enantioselectivity.








Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the enantioselective insertion of carbenes into heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds, this chemistry is restricted to the construction of carbon&#8208;based chirality. The asymmetric insertion of carbenes into P&#9472;H that delivers P&#8208;chiral products remains untouched. Rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides via asymmetric C&#9472;P coupling of a secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) with diazonaphthoquinone is herein reported. Driven by aromatization, this protocol affords a variety of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides tethered to a 2&#8208;naphthol functionality in excellent enantioselectivity by following a kinetic resolution reaction pattern. The diverse synthetic and catalytic applications of the P&#8208;chiral products highlight the value of this method, even though the derivatized trivalent chiral phosphine bears a rather low barrier of racemization.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Chemoselectivity in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) Alkyne Cyclotrimerization</title>

Chemoselectivity Challenge: A precise catalyst design allows for chemoselectivity control over alkyne reactivity to yield pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) cyclotrimerization. Operative mechanism has been elucidated by means of stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations.








Abstract
The synthesis of pentafulvenes with varied substituents has been efficiently achieved using novel rhodium&#8208;based catalysts via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) alkyne cyclotrimerization. A rational design of the catalyst structure, including pyridonato, NHC, and CO ligands, ensures the alkyne chemoselectivity and prevents the formation of robust rhodium&#8208;fulvene species. Furthermore, the judicious choice of acidity and steric properties of different alkynes enables the preparation of cross&#8208;coupled fulvene derivatives. Stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations, shed light on the reaction mechanism, showing that it includes an initial alkyne deprotonation, two successive alkyne insertions, cyclization, and protonolysis, the first insertion being the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Unexpected Activities of CYP152 Peroxygenases Toward Non&#8208;carboxylic Substrates Reveal Novel Substrate Recognition Mechanism and Catalytic Versatility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study unveils novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities of CYP152 peroxygenases toward various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group. Mechanistic analyses provide new insights into non&#8208;carboxylic substrate&#8208;assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis for hydrogen peroxide activation, inspiring potential applications in industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.








Abstract
Exploring and exploiting the catalytic promiscuity of enzymes is a central topic and captivating challenge in enzymology. CYP152 peroxygenases are attractive biocatalysts for diverse reactions under mild conditions using H2O2 as cofactor. However, their substrate scope is limited by a carboxyl group required for substrate assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis, following the well&#8208;accepted principle that heme&#8208;dependent H2O2&#8208;utilizing enzymes employ a carboxyl group within their active sites to facilitate H2O2 activation. Herein, we reveal for the first time that several CYP152 family members can directly degrade various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group, exhibiting novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities. Through crystal structure analysis, isotope tracing experiments, and QM/MM calculations, we elucidate that the phenolic hydroxyl group activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent(s) functionally replaces the carboxyl group, forming hydrogen bonds with the conserved arginine leading to Compound I formation. The oxygen atom of the newly formed hydroxyl group originates from water, bypassing the conventional oxygen rebound step. These findings provide first insights into the mechanisms of P450 peroxygenases toward non&#8208;carboxylic substrates, expanding our knowledge of biological C&#9472;H activation and C&#8208;halogen bond cleavage beyond canonical P450 reactions. This discovery holds immense potential for harnessing these enzymes in innovative strategies for industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.

         <title>Si/Carbon&#8208;dots with Surface N&#8208;C Sites Promoting Proton and Electron Transfers in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH step is considered the rate&#8208;determining step in the oxygen reduction reaction. Silane chain&#8208;grafted carbon dots with N&#8208;C active sites help overcome the energy barrier through promoting proton and electron transfers, thereby enhancing H2O2 production in photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed through either a two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron pathway, both of which are important for a wide range of applications. The intermediate conversion of *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH recognized as the rate&#8208;determining step in ORR, with its efficiency strongly dependent on the nature of active sites at the surface of a catalyst. Herein, Si&#8208;supported carbon dots (Si&#8208;CDs) are introduced as cocatalysts in a photocatalytic system, where their nitrogen&#8211;carbon sites play a pivotal role in lowering the energy barrier for *OOH formation by promoting proton and electron transfers, thus enhancing the H2O2 production rate in ORR. This strategy is broadly applicable across a wide range of photocatalysts, both with and without use of sacrificial agents. The H2O2 production rate for Zn0.5Cd0.5S (30&#160;mg) increased from 13.0 to 40.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 when 0.6&#160;mg of Si&#8208;CDs were added. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations are conducted to reveal the reaction pathway and the reduced energy requirements for the *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH conversion. This study provides a unique example of overcoming a key barrier in ORR using a metal&#8208;free catalyst and promotes potential applications in various fields.

         <title>Mechanistic Promiscuity in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated CO2 Reduction Reaction: One&#8208; Versus Two&#8208;Electron Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobalt complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2&#8314;, and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2&#8314; show contrasting CO&#8322; reduction behaviors. [(Hbbpya)CoII]2&#8314; selectively forms CO via a fast, two&#8208;electron pathway aided by a &#8208;NH proton relay, while [(Mebbpya)CoII]2&#8314; favours hydrogen evolution due to a slower, competitive one&#8208;electron mechanism. Stopped&#8208;flow studies reveal a reactive CO&#8322; radical anion, offering insights into their distinct catalytic pathways.








Abstract
We compare the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) activity and selectivity of the complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+, which contain two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine chelating groups linked by &#8208;NH or &#8208;NCH3 moieties, respectively. Whereas [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ forms CO under electrocatalytic conditions in presence of phenol (PhOH) with high selectivity, [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+ shows higher hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low selectivity for CO production. The molecular origin of the difference in product selectivity was analysed based on spectroscopic trapping of reactive intermediates and detailed kinetic and theoretical studies. A difference in mechanism is evident; whereas an efficient proton relay mediated by the &#8208;NH group initiates a two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 in the case of [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+, one&#8208;electron chemistry prevails for [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+. Under stopped&#8208;flow conditions, we trapped the one&#8208;electron reduced CO2 radical anion in [(Mebbpya)CoI(CO2&#8722;&#8226;)], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions. This study underlines the importance of subtle electronic and protonation changes in controlling the CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Dual Chemical Scissors Strategy Enables 1D Antimony Selenates with Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III)&#8212;were successfully designed and synthesized via dual chemical scissors strategy. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong SHG response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for UV NLO applications.








Abstract
The rational, function&#8208;driven design of advanced inorganic functional materials remains a significant challenge, primarily attributed to their inherently complex and highly connected 3D frameworks of most oxide&#8208;based systems. Herein, we report a &#8220;dual chemical scissors&#8221; strategy that synergistically combines the effects of fluoride ions and stereochemically active lone pairs to precisely modulate local coordination environments and enable controlled dimensional reduction. Using this approach, we successfully synthesized the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III). These compounds feature well&#8208;defined helical chain structures constructed from SbOxFy polyhedra and SeO4 tetrahedra, resulting in pronounced optical anisotropy and robust nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for ultraviolet NLO applications. This work establishes a powerful and generalizable structural design paradigm for constructing polar low&#8208;dimensional architectures and underscores the effectiveness of targeted coordination modulation in advancing high&#8208;performance optical materials.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Carbazolyl Cyanobenzene Conjugates: Enabling Biomolecule Functionalization via Photoredox and Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce two methods for incorporating carbazolyl cyanobenzenes onto peptides: a C&#8208;terminus decarboxylative functionalization and a Cys&#8208;selective SNAr reaction. Both conjugates exhibit excellent photoredox/energy&#8208;transfer properties, enabling their use for C&#8208;terminal alkynylation and Cys&#8208;selective thiol&#8208;ene reactions on peptides, as well as proximity&#8208;driven labeling next to integrin &#945;v&#946;3 by aryl azide excitation in living cells.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2012, carbazolyl (iso)phthalonitrile (Cz(I)PN) derivatives have found significant applications as photocatalysts (PCs) in organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce two efficient methods for incorporating carbazolyl cyanobenzenes into various peptide sequences. The first method involves a photomediated decarboxylative functionalization of the C&#8208;terminus of peptides, leading to the formation of various carbazolyl benzonitrile (CzBN) derivatives. The second method exploits a cysteine&#8208;selective SNAr reaction on a fluorinated arene precursor, resulting in novel peptide&#8208;3CzIPN (triscarbazolyl&#8208;isophthalonitrile) conjugates. Both types of conjugates maintain delayed fluorescence properties, exhibit similar or wider redox potential, and possess higher excited state energy when compared to currently used cyanoarenes. We demonstrated the photocatalytic activity of these conjugates first through a photo&#8208;mediated peptide C&#8208;terminal decarboxylative alkynylation. Then, water&#8208;soluble peptide conjugates were used to catalyze a thiol&#8208;ene reaction on cysteine in aqueous media. Finally, we achieved protein labeling via aryl azide excitation both in vitro and at the cellular level using peptide&#8208;CzIPN conjugates. By incorporating a peptide ligand of the protein integrin &#945;v&#946;3, proximity&#8208;driven labeling next to this target was realized by aryl azide excitation in living cells, showing an excellent overlap with antibody&#8208;based imaging. These findings reveal the potential of cyanoarene&#8208;peptide conjugates for proximity&#8208;driven photochemistry in a complex biological context.

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, polymer&#8208;containing Cage&#8208;POPs and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.</dc:description>

The structures parallel the non&#8208;VESPR structures of alkaline earth metal difluorides and dihydrides, such that FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar, FCa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar but with a shallow bending&#8208;potential curve, while FSr(&#951;2&#8208;OF) and FBa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) are non&#8208;planar. Bonding analyses show that the interactions between the metal center M2+ and the negatively charged ligands F&#8722; and OF&#8722; are mainly electrostatic. Moreover, for FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF), donation of electron density from OF&#8722; to empty s and p orbitals of magnesium is involved. However, for the heavier alkaline earth metal compounds, the donation to empty d orbitals of the metal center becomes dominant in orbital interactions, which contributes to their non&#8208;planar structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;Tag Chemical Inducers of Dimerization to Probe Receptor Oligomerization and Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling protein&#8208;protein interactions is critical for dissecting signaling pathways, especially those initiated by ligand&#8208;receptor interactions which alter receptor oligomerization and drive downstream signaling cascades. Traditional methods for driving protein&#8208;protein complexes are using antibodies that face limitations in terms of stoichiometry, geometric rigidity, and antibody specificity. Chemical Inducers of Dimerization (CIDs) for fusion proteins such as HaloTag (Halo) and SNAP&#8208;Tags (SNAP) offer precise and covalent control of protein proximities, overcoming limitations of antibody&#8208;dependent methods. In this study, we expand the toolkit of Halo and SNAP CIDs with (1) benzylguanine (BG) and HaloTag ligand (HTL) crosslinkers featuring varying polyethylene glycol linker lengths and update this kit with (2) a FRET&#8208;based dimerizing sensor to induce and verify protein proximity. Here we establish our CIDs on extracellularly Halo&#8208; and SNAP&#8208;tagged TGF&#946;, BMP, neurotrophic factor and metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby elucidating the signaling potential of ligand&#8208;independent dimerization in a heteromeric fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsaturated Phosphine Oxides for Modular Antibody Rebridging and Single Reagent Peptide&#8208;Cyclisation&#8208;Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals; especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>Trigonal Planar Bis(carbene)Cu(I) Complexes Enable Divergent H2 Activation with H2O for Accelerated Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trigonal planar naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene)Cu(I) alkyl, hydroxide, and ethoxide complexes promote a divergent mechanism of H2 activation for the rare catalytic hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes at mild conditions at copper. 








Abstract
CuH&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydrogenation is rare compared to those of carbonyl&#8208;derived substrates. Olefin insertion into Cu&#8211;H to form Cu&#8208;alkyl is ubiquitous; however, subsequent H2 activation remains unknown to our knowledge. Herein, we investigated the transformations of &#946;&#8208;H elimination, H2 cleavage, and catalytic olefin hydrogenation in a series of linear and trigonal planar Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl complexes supported by monodentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and bidentate naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligands, respectively. Contrary to unreactive linear species, trigonal planar variants promote &#946;&#8208;H elimination, hydrogenolysis, and catalytic hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes at mild temperatures and H2 pressure. The rare isolation of a naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene)CuH monomer further affirms two predominant competing pathways for H2 cleavage of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity at Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl or internal electrophilic substitution at Cu(I)&#8208;OH. Employing either isolated or in situ generated Cu(I)&#8208;OH complex, via protonolysis of alkyl precatalyst by adventitious water, significantly accelerated catalysis compared to that operating primarily by the metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity pathway. DFT calculations and energy decomposition analysis on the disparate &#946;&#8208;H elimination reactivity between linear and trigonal planar tert&#8208;butyl complexes and the mechanism of H2 activation at a hydroxide complex, indicate that coordination geometry at Cu(I) and properties of the naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligand are integral to the transformations reported here.

         <title>A Dual Cofactor Co&#8208;Decorated Covalent Organic Framework as an Electron Transfer Regulator for Biomimetic Dioxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking the synergy of multiple active sites of oxygenase to achieve selective O2 activation for various oxidation is a very challenging but meaningful task. By introducing the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide active site dihydropyridine amido (DHPA) moiety and heme, a dual cofactor co&#8208;decorated covalent organic framework (COF) was obtained to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of the cytochrome P450 for biomimetic O2 activation. Covalent co&#8208;decoration of dual cofactors in COFs ensures the rapid photogenerated electron&#160;transfer from DHPA to heme FeIII to generate FeII, selectively activating O2 to form FeIII&#8722;O2&#8226;&#8722; resembling the cytochrome P450 for improving the efficiency and selectivity of alcohol oxidation, avoiding conventionally complex multistep cofactor shuttling and regeneration. Control experiments of a COF analogue containing heme but not DHPA suggested that this dual cofactor construction strategy renders COFs the excellent activity and&#160; selectivity for O2 activation. As far as we know, this represents the first case of introducing dual cofactor into COFs to echo the cytochrome P450. The well&#8208;defined structural characters and the fine&#8208;modified bioactive properties open a new avenue to develop novel COFs, which not only augments the diversity of the COFs family but also broadens the application of COFs in the field of biomimetic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Energy Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion Through Anion Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanol, with its high market value and stable global demand, stands out as an attractive product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, achieving high ethanol selectivity and energy efficiency at industrial current densities remains challenging. In this study, we employed a blended anion modulation strategy to enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion. The Cu2(OH)3F pre&#8208;catalyst achieved faraday efficiencies of 50% and 93% for ethanol and C2+, respectively, at 700 mA cm&#8722;2 in a blended electrolyte consisting of 2 M KOH and 1 M KCl. Comprehensive electrochemical tests, combined with in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis, revealed that chloride and hydroxide increased *CO coverage for efficient C&#8208;C coupling. Moreover, hydroxide stabilizes the *CHCOH intermediate through hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed hydroxide on the catalyst surface, while Cl synergistically enhances its reactivity by promoting water dissociation toward the ethanol pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategy for Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes: Regulated Active Groups Enable High Capacity and Voltage in Aqueous and Seawater Aluminium ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials demonstrate significant potential as electrodes for aqueous batteries, owing to their high theoretical capacity, structurally tunable frameworks, and sustainable material accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule organic electrode materials enable better active&#8208;site accessibility but remain challenged by the dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which deteriorates cycling stability, and poor conductivity due to limited conjugation. Here, we designed an organic small&#8208;molecule cathode material (DPPZ&#8208;CN) featuring functional pyridine, pyrazine, and cyano groups. Its highly conjugated fused N&#8208;heteroaromatic structure provides strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity, resulting in improved stability, capacity, and conductivity. The electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano group further modulates electron delocalization and molecular orbitals, enhancing electronic conductivity and operating voltage. Through combined theoretical and experimental studies, including operando synchrotron FT&#8208;IR, in situ Raman, ex situ XPS and 1H NMR, we demonstrate that DPPZ&#8208;CN facilitates efficient dual&#8208;cation storage (Al3+/H+), thereby reducing Al3+ cation repulsion and induced structural distortion. As a result, the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery exhibits outstanding capacity, a well&#8208;defined voltage plateau, and an extended lifespan in organic aluminum batteries with aqueous and seawater electrolytes, highlighting its potential for operation in challenging environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Chemical and Photochemical Stability for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest for their potential in photocatalytic solar fuel generation. However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused&#8208;heterocycle thiazole&#8208;linked COFs (TZ&#8208;COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction using chrysene&#8208;6,12&#8208;diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused&#8208;ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12 M HCl), strong base (12 M KOH and 1 M MeONa), reducing (1 M NaBH4) and oxidizing (1 M H2O2) agents, along with   superior  photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazole s introduce  new,  robust protonation sites  compared to commonly used imine  linkages, which  improve  the hydrophilicit y , expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework .  TZ&#8208;COF&#8208;17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.</dc:description>

However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused-heterocycle thiazole-linked COFs (TZ-COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one-pot three-component reaction using chrysene-6,12-diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused-ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12 M HCl), strong base (12 M KOH and 1 M MeONa), reducing (1 M NaBH4) and oxidizing (1 M H2O2) agents, along with   superior  photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazole s introduce  new,  robust protonation sites  compared to commonly used imine  linkages, which  improve  the hydrophilicit y , expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework .  TZ-COF-17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Bromine Complexation and Kinetics: A Bisimidazole Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8208;Br Static Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8211;bromine (Zn&#8211;Br) static batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage, yet the practical application is hindered by the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off about bromine complexing agents (BCAs) between bromine complexation strength and redox kinetics. Herein, we report a rationally designed bisimidazolium salt, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;1&#8208;yl) butane dibromide ([bMImB]Br2), which features a symmetric molecular structure that reconciles this contradiction. [bMImB]Br2 demonstrates strong bromine affinity, stemming from its high atomic charge of N+ and low solubility&#8212;properties comparable to those of tetraalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts. Simultaneously, it retains low steric hindrance typical of monoimidazole compounds, thereby enabling fast electrode kinetics. As a result, Zn&#8211;Br batteries incorporating [bMImB]Br2 deliver a high specific energy of 116 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1, alongside an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.22% and energy efficiency (EE) of 89.35% at 10 mAh&#183;cm&#8722;2 (0.5 C) for over 150 cycles. Furthermore, the flexible pouch cell maintains a discharge capacity of 110 mAh and 99.7% CE over 100 cycles, even under mechanical deformation. This work offers a generalizable molecular design strategy for developing next&#8208;generation BCAs in halogen&#8208;based energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Homologous Ladder Cyclohexasilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of five new examples of ladder cyclohexasilanes, possessing up to three consecutive fused rings. The synthesis of ladder compounds is challenging for both organic and inorganic skeletons, but Si&#8217;s tetrahedral geometry introduces the problem of diastereoisomerism: with each additional ring, the number of possible stereoisomers differing only in relative configuration at the ring fusion increases. By coupling a 1,4&#8208;dipotassiooligosilyl dianion to a central cyclohexasilane, we report the isolation of three of the five possible diastereomers of the ladder tricyclohexasilane. Combined experimental and theoretical studies suggest a kinetic selectivity for the cis diastereomer and a thermodynamic preference for the trans diastereomer that is also dependent on the structure of the dianion. Computational studies show that with each additional ring in the trans&#8208;diastereomeric series, the predicted onset of light absorption shifts to longer wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Derived Polyanionic Crosslinked Gel Interfacial Layer with Ion&#8208;Sieving and Ion&#8208;Regulating Capabilities for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sever side reactions and rampant dendrite growth on the zinc (Zn) electrode significantly hinder the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs).  Herein, we fabricate a multifunctional interfacial layer composed of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and  polyanionic gel featuring ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capabilities that effectively protects the Zn anode. The abundant &#8208;SO3&#8208; groups in polyanionic gel optimize the Zn2+ solvent sheath structure and simultaneously possess ion&#8208;sieving function, which significantly facilitate Zn2+ migration.The lignin derivatives pre&#8208;adsorb onto the Zn anode surface, guiding nucleation along the Zn (002) plane and providing electrostatic shielding effects to facilitate uniform Zn2+ deposition. In addition, polyanionic gel inhibits water activity by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water, while the PVDF layer adjacent to Zn electrode side significantly reduces the free water&#8208;induced side reactions. Consequently, the Zn electrodes with this protective layer demonstrated stable and efficient deposition/stripping behavior over a wide range of current densities. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells demonstrate remarkable cycling stability, maintaining the capacity of 176.1 mAh g&#8208;1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1 and 101.2 mAh g&#8208;1 after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1. This innovative strategy offers a promising approach to develop high&#8208;performance AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored in Metal Borides Enable Hydrogen Spillover for&#160;Superior Electrochemical Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of nitrate represents a promising and sustainable route for valuable ammonia generation. However, a vital challenge in the nitrate reduction reaction is an insufficient supply of active hydrogen (*H) and slow kinetics at a low working potential, which results in low production efficiency and high energy consumption. Here, we report the single&#8208;atom Ru decorated nanoporous metal borides as a high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalyst utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. Notably, the RuSA/np&#8208;Ni3B exhibits a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.2%, a NH3 yield of 30.4 mg h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1, and an energy efficiency of 39.1% at &#8208;0.1 V vs. RHE. In situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;atom Ru anchored in nanoporous Ni3B not only can efficiently dissociate water into *H and simultaneously promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface, but also can optimize surface states of Ni3B active centers, which synergistically reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer integrating nitrate reduction reaction with furfuryl alcohol oxidation reaction achieves current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;1.72 V with 100 h stability, improving the energy efficiency and economy of the system.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration NO is important but suffers from low Faraday efficiency and current density because of severe competitive hydrogen and ammonia evolution reactions. Here, porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies reveal that porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing ammonia and hydrogen formation. This work paves the way for accessing low&#8208;concentration gaseous reactants for various catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

Here, porous carbon-supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies reveal that porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing ammonia and hydrogen formation. This work paves the way for accessing low-concentration gaseous reactants for various catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Responsive RNA Release Through Structural Optimization of Disulfide&#8208;Containing Acyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical methods for modifying and manipulating RNA are crucial for advancing its biological studies and applications. While post&#8208;synthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation has enabled on&#8208;demand RNA activation, its application to larger, biologically relevant RNAs remains challenging. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;responsive RNA modification via post&#8208;synthetic acylation to functionalize RNAs. Three strategies were developed to introduce multiple disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts at 2&#8217;&#8208;OH positions, temporarily blocking RNA function. Exposure to glutathione (GSH) can trigger the traceless release of RNA and restore its biological function. We demonstrate the versatility of this redox&#8208;responsive strategy with RNA constructs of varying lengths, including short synthetic RNA, single guide RNA (sgRNA) as well as longer messenger RNA (mRNA). Furthermore, these disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts respond to endogenous GSH, restoring mRNA translation without the need for cytotoxic exogenous stimuli. Taken together, these results offer a simple and generalizable method for modifying and modulating RNAs regardless of length or origin through structural optimization of acyl groups for facilitating RNA release, setting the stage for broad applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bioinspired Diazafluorenone Catalytic System for Aerobic Oxidative Deamination of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper amine oxidases catalyzed aerobic oxidation of primary amines into carbonyl compounds is an important biological process, as well as a useful transformation for organic synthesis. A new bioinspired organocatalyst, 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), has been discovered, which exhibits impressive characteristics including simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity, enabling it to effectively mimic the function of copper amine oxidases. Oxidative deamination of &#945;&#8208;amino amides presents an attractive approach to access &#945;&#8208;keto amides, however, it is difficult to achieve due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric effect. The diazafluorenone displays high catalytic activity in this transformation, producing various biologically significant &#945;&#8208;keto amides in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the diazafluorenone catalyst is able to promote direct oxidation of benzylamines into aromatic aldehydes, instead of the generally formed product&#8208;reactant imines, which leads to not greater than 50% yields of the desired aldehydes. The current aerobic oxidative deamination proceeds via a pathway similar to the biological process, involving transamination, hydrolysis/aminolysis, and aerobic oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Selection of Ribofuranose&#8208;Isomer Among Pentoses by Phosphorylation with Diamidophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique structure&#8208;function relationship of the ribofuranose&#8208;ring in RNA has inspired various chemical pathways to select for the ribofuranose form (over the ribopyranose form), especially in a prebiotic context. Herein we show that the reaction of diamidophosphate (DAP) with the four pentoses &#8208; ribose, arabinose, xylose and lyxose &#8208; naturally selects the ribofuranose form more efficiently when compared to the other three pentoses. All four pentoses form the initial diamidophosphate&#8208;adduct &#8211; however, ribose undergoes rapid conversion to ribofuranose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while the other three pentoses show significant accumulation of the initially formed DAP&#8208;adducts and slow conversion to the cyclicphosphate products. Arabinose and xylose show a distribution between furanose&#8208;, and pyranose&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while lyxose forms the furanose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and &#8208;pyranose&#8208;2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products. This trend is also manifested when starting from a mixture of pentoses where ribofuranose 1,2&#8208;amidocyclicphosphate dominates the product distribution. Such selection for ribofuranose among pentoses by phosphorylation (a) provides another venue of how a ribofuranose&#8208;structure can selectively emerge through abiotic chemical reaction suitable for elaboration towards RNA and (b) adds to the body of experimental work addressing the chemical origin of RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons. We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65 nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550 nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A 'Cocktail' Fluorescent Probe for Multi&#8208;ROS Imaging Unveils Ferroptosis&#8208;Driven Liver Fibrosis Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liver fibrosis is a pathological repair response triggered by chronic liver injury. Without treatment, it may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing to high mortality rates. To date, no approved therapies specifically target advanced liver fibrosis, thus exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis has become crucial. Previous studies have highlighted significant controversy regarding the role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis. Given that ROS serve as key mediators in both ferroptosis and liver fibrosis, ROS may serve as a molecular nexus connecting ferroptosis and liver fibrosis. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular network involving ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, we designed and synthesized the first multi&#8208;functional 'cocktail' fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, enabling highly sensitive and selective simultaneous imaging of O2&#8226;&#8211;, H2O2 and ONOO&#8722;. FP&#8208;ROS was successfully employed to assess ferroptosis levels in the livers of fibrosis mice following drug intervention. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we elucidated the signaling pathway NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a critical role in HSCs activation and further elucidates the molecular interplay between ROS and ferroptosis in fibrosis progression. These findings provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin PtSe2 Nanowires in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum selenide (PtSe2) has shown great potential for application in electrocatalysis. One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures are particularly advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance, as they expose abundant active sites at the edges and enable rapid charge transport. However, the synthesis of 1D PtSe2 nanostructures for efficient electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of ultrathin (0.4&#8208;2.0 nm) PtSe2 nanowires (NWs) using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a confined template via direct selenization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The atom&#8208;resolved electron microscope combined with spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, possessing zigzag edges and higher thermodynamical stability. Owing to the rich&#8208;edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684 wt%, with an overpotential of 47 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7 mV dec&#8208;1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low&#8208;cost and efficient Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the future.</dc:description>

Owing to the rich-edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as-prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684 wt%, with an overpotential of 47 mV@10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7 mV dec-1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low-cost and efficient Pt-based catalysts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The distinctive chemical properties of fluorine atoms have enabled fluorine&#8208;containing compounds to make significant strides in the pharmaceutical and materials fields. However, due to the very limited synthetic methods, the enormous potential of N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds has not yet been unlocked. In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. Additionally, the reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sila&#8208;Cycloaddition of Dichlorodisilanes: Selective Si&#8211;Cl Activation for Cyclic Disilanes and Enantioenriched Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4+2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. This transformation proceeds under mild, reductive nickel catalysis via an unusual Si&#8211;Cl bond activation pathway and accommodates a broad range of dienes, including bulk feedstocks, cyclic, multi&#8208;substituted, aliphatic, aromatic dienes, and trienes. An asymmetric variant further enables the efficient construction of chiral disilane frameworks with high enantioselectivity. The resulting disilacarbocycle adopts boat&#8208;like conformations, as revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis, due to the elongated Si&#8211;Si and Si&#8211;C bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that a triplet Ni0 species engages in an SN2&#8208;type oxidative addition to the Si&#8211;Cl bond, favoring this pathway over a concerted Si&#8211;Si activation. The resulting Si&#8211;Ni(I) intermediates are energetically preferred over Si&#8211;Ni(II) analogs in the subsequent diene insertion step.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;&#173;Photosensitizer Repositioning Affords an Enantiocomplementary Enzyme for [2+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of genetic code expansion and directed evolution has recently given rise to enantioselective photoenzymes for [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of quinolone and indole derivatives. However, the enzymes reported to date only allow access to one enantiomeric series of the strained cyclobutane products. Here, guided by a crystal structure of our previously engineered enzyme EnT1.3, we show how judicious repositioning of the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer affords an enantiocomplementary [2+2]&#8208;cyclase, CEnT1.0. Following directed evolution, a proficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzyme (CEnT1.4) emerged that promotes [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of a quinolone derivative with exquisite enantiocontrol (99% e.e.) and substantially enhanced regioselectivity compared with EnT1.3 (r.r. 62:1 vs 9:1). Structural analysis of CEnT1.4, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveal a well&#8208;sculpted active site pocket that pre&#8208;organises the substrate for regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalysis. This study highlights the versatility offered by genetically programmed (photo)catalytic elements when developing enzymes for altered stereochemical outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Activated Tumor&#8208;Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical molecular imaging with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe (termed MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS&#8208;responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high&#8208;contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (~3 mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3.8V Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery Enabled by a Conjugated Ladder Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries based on non&#8208;metal charge carriers like NH4+ recently have attracted intensive attention due to high safety, environmental friendliness, low cost and fast kinetics. However, NH4+ electrolytes suffer from a narrow electrochemical potential window, making it challenging to construct high&#8208;voltage and energy&#8208;dense devices. Here we report a quaternary ammonium (NR4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) working at a high voltage of 3.8V, which was enabled by a conjugated ladder polymer poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) anode for NR4+ storage and a graphite cathode for anion uptake. The BBL functions as an efficient NR4+ host by carbonyl/enol transformation, delivering a high capacity of 120 mAh/g, low average potential, high stability and excellent rate performance. In the redox process, the electronic and ionic conductivities of BBL change periodically, accompanied with the formation of radical anion (&#9679;&#8722;) and diradical dianion (2&#9679;&#8722;). In combination with an anion&#8208;intercalation graphite cathode, the assembled graphite//BBL DIB exhibits a maximum energy/power density up to 232 Wh/kg and 6865 W/kg based on mass of graphite, superior rate performance and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of NR4+ as cation carrier and its efficient host, which will inspire novel design for high&#8208;performance non&#8208;metallic energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>New Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Based on Covalent Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single&#8208;molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage&#8208;electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single&#8208;molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single&#8208;molecule conductance was found at 10&#8208;3.5 G&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well&#8208;defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.</dc:description>

         <title>From Corrosion to Creation: Interfacial De&#8208;electronation Drives Hydrogenation&#8208;Energy Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal corrosion, conventionally perceived as a destructive phenomenon driven by de&#8208;electronation, imposes significant economic burdens and safety hazards. To repurpose corrosion into a valuable resource, we demonstrate a macroscopic corrosion battery concept that harnesses galvanic corrosion to drive the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals and energy generation, challenging conventional corrosion mitigation paradigms. By spatially segregating corrosion process, the system couples anodic metal de&#8208;electronation with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) deposition, while integrating diverse cathodic reactions including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction, electrocatalytic hydrogenation, and hydrogen peroxide reduction with remarkable accelerated kinetics. The prototype system demonstrates concurrent production of p&#8208;aminophenol (14.3 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) and zinc oxalate (86.9 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) while generating 34.2 mW cm&#8208;2 of electrical power. Techno&#8208;economic analysis establishes the inaugural empirical validation of economic feasibility for corrosion&#8208;driven energy&#8208;matter symbiosis, highlighting its high gross profit. Transcending conventional corrosion engineering boundaries for inorganic synthesis, this methodology mechanistically deciphers MOF growth kinetics and advanced system design. By broadening the scope of corrosion utilization, this work enables a paradigm shift from damage mitigation to value creation, providing a blueprint for sustainable chemical&#8208;energy ecosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Power of Dark State Photocages: An Efficient Pathway to Triplet State under Near&#8208;Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocage platform provides a synergistic approach to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Before light activation, both pro&#8208;photosensitizers and pro&#8208;drugs remain inert, ensuring safety. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, they undergo photoactivation and controlled release in deep tissues. However, the low photolysis efficiency of conventional singlet&#8208;state photocages limits their in vivo applications, necessitating an exploration of how excited&#8208;state dynamics influence photolysis. In this study, we introduce the concept of a "dark state photocage" and establish a photocage platform responsive to NIR light by incorporating phenoxazine or phenothiazine groups. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the dark state enhances triplet&#8208;state formation and facilitates intersystem crossing, thereby promoting photolysis. These photocages achieve functional molecule release under low&#8208;power NIR light (15 mW&#183;cm&#8315;&#178;), with an efficiency of up to 90%. This advancement enables a sharp transition from an "OFF" to an "ON" tumor imaging signal and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer under NIR light irradiation, effectively integrating PDT and chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Acrylamide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via Mannich Polymerization for Efficient Gold Recovery from Complex E&#8208;waste Leachates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization involving 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene, Meldrum&#8217;s acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide&#8208;linked COFs (Tb&#8208;PD&#8208;M, Tb&#8208;ND&#8208;M, and Tb&#8208;AD&#8208;M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C=O and N&#8208;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, Tb&#8208;AD&#8208;M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Differentiation of Homologous Anisodimensional Frameworks Driven by Site&#8208;Selective Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretically, distinguished from the dimensional isomers in reticular chemistry, structures with different dimensions can also be formed by site&#8208;selective polymerization using identical building blocks bearing a high density of reactive sites. Unfortunately, the spatial confinement imposes significant challenges for molecular building blocks to achieve dimensional differentiation via their intrinsic site&#8208;selective reactivity. In this work, we first report the dimensional transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) driven by site&#8208;selective polymerization of identical molecular building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. This unique phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time to originate from the role of aniline in enhancing the reversibility of the reaction system and modulating the conformational flexibility of the monomers. We systematically elucidated the mechanism underlying this dimensional transformation and successfully demonstrated the generality of the synthetic strategy. Moreover, the residual benzaldehyde in the frameworks generated via the site&#8208;selective polymerization of the building blocks can serve as exciton acceptors, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work not only offers a novel strategy for regulating the dimensionality of COFs, but also provides a valuable reference for precisely controlling the conformational flexibility of building blocks to enable topological transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Macrocycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Strategy for Interchangeable Screwdriver&#8208;Like On&#8208;Demand Post&#8208;Functionalization of Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post&#8208;functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time&#8208;consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs. Moreover, their functions are difficult to change once the functionalities are covalently attached to COF skeletons. Herein, we report a macrocycle&#8208;based supramolecular strategy for variable noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform like an interchangeable screwdriver. As a proof of concept, pillar[5]arene (P5A) with electron&#8208;rich cavity is incorporated into COF as macrocycle host to anchor different electron&#8208;deficient guests of various functions. Such a design allows tunable post&#8208;functionalization of COF through host&#8208;guest interactions for customized utilities, which has been demonstrated by using a series of guests including organic salts for iodine capture and cyano&#8208;based ligands for metal ion separation. Removing the guests enables recycling of COF, consecutive reinstallation of different guests, and continuous use for implementing expected tasks. This work establishes a general noncovalent approach to on&#8208;demand interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Cyanogen Vacancies in Prussian Blue for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB), recognized as a promising cathode material, has gained significant attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the influence of anion vacancies on the stability of the PB framework remains controversy, impeding a comprehensive grasp of their precise role in electrochemical performance and the controlled synthesis of PB with smaller unitary anionic vacancies remains challenging because of the limitations inherent in current synthesis strategy. Herein, we present an anion complexation method to synthesize PB materials with modulable cyanogen vacancy contents. Furthermore, we propose a vacancy&#8208;driven mechanism that promotes spin transitions coupled with lattice bending, which is more reversible at low&#8208;spin Fe sites, leading to excellent low&#8208;spin stability and the design of materials with outstanding electrochemical performance. This anion complexation method not only provides a novel synthetic pathway for PB materials but also advances the understanding of the composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships between cyanogen vacancy structures and spin transition mechanism, highlighting its potential for future energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Polyester Waste using Reconstructed Defective&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical recycling of polyester waste presents a promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular economy. However, the development of efficient, low&#8208;cost recycling methods that minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions remains challenging. Here, we report an approach for depolymerization polyester waste to bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) using a reconstructed metal&#8208;organic framework (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) catalyst under mild conditions. The r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT exhibited a space&#8208;time yield of 1035.8 gBHET gcat&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 at 190 &#186;C. Importantly, this is an order of magnitude higher than that reported for similar MOF&#8208;based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the depolymerization pathway involves the activation of oxygen and ethylene glycol adsorbed on r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT, forming nucleophilic intermediates. These intermediates then facilitate the cleavage of polyester C&#8211;O bond through nucleophilic attack, thereby gradually generating the BHET product. Sustainability evaluation results validated the circular economy feasibility of the recycling approach, with a minimum sales price (MSP) of 498 $/ton, much lower than the MSP of the traditional petroleum&#8208;based production route (1,000 $/ton). The approach also achieved a 61% reduction in energy use and a 52% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a sustainable solution for managing polyester waste accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of Retro&#8208;Isomeric Peptides for Tuning the Polymer Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidomimetic polymers containing hydrophobic amino acids and non&#8208;peptidic linkages are interesting for various applications, particularly hydrophobic coatings. We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers decorated with azide and alkyne,&#160;viz. N3&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M1) and its retro&#8208;isomer N3&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M2), for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. On heating the crystals at 100 &#176;C, both monomers underwent TAAC polymerization, yielding isomeric &#8216;difficult peptide&#8217; polymer mimics. The monomers showed stark differences in reactivity and regiochemistry of the product formed. Monomer&#160;M1&#160;yielded polymer&#160;P1&#160;having a 1:1 ratio of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linkages, and monomer&#160;M2&#160;reacted regiospecifically, giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer&#160;P2. We investigated the hydrophobicity of these isomeric polymers by measuring water contact angles (WCA) of surfaces coated with these polymers;&#160;P1&#160;and&#160;P2&#160;showed WCA of 120&#176; and 132&#176;, respectively. Our study demonstrates that sequence reversal is a novel approach for accessing structurally and functionally different polymers&#160;via&#160;topochemical polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;state NMR Reveals Reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cell Wall Due to a Host&#8208;Defence Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited availability of antifungal drug treatments and the rising issue of drug resistance highlight the urgent need for new antifungal drugs to combat drug&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The host&#8208;defence peptide cathelicidin&#8208;2 has demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on azole&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus but its mechanism of action remains elusive. We applied a tailored set 1H and 13C detected solid state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to elucidate the cell wall composition of Aspergillus fumigatus and to shed light on the mechanism of action of the peptide within the cell wall. Our results revealed that presence of the peptide affects galactosaminogalactan, an important component involved in the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, as well as other specific polysaccharides and amino acids within the mobile cell wall domain. At longer exposure times, the peptide also influences the rigid cell wall domains by enhancing water penetration into the hydrophobic rigid cell wall domain. The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (chevron&#8208;GNR and chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Cryptographic Key&#8208;Based Fluorescence Encryption Enabled by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing threats of data forgery and security breaches necessitate the development of advanced encryption strategies beyond traditional cryptographic methods. Fluorescence&#8208;based encryption has emerged as a promising alternative, yet current systems suffer from low security due to simple, reversible stimuli responses. Here, we introduce a novel lock&#8208;and&#8208;key encryption system using a chiral cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CDMOF), termed Zole@CDMOF (Zole = acetylated benzoimidazole), for enantioselective discrimination of phenylethylamine (PEA) enantiomers. In this framework, the confined Zole guest serves as the lock, while PEA enantiomers act as the key, selectively triggering fluorescence turn&#8208;on via acetyl&#8208;O bond cleavage and restoring excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of deacetylated Zole. Mechanistic studies reveal that enantioselectivity arises from thermodynamic differences and distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between PEA enantiomers. To enhance practical application, Zole@CDMOF is fabricated into a flexible sensor via a simple scotch tape strategy, enabling direct visual indexing of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, we propose a barcode&#8208;based chiral encryption model, establishing a quadruply encrypted system with ultra&#8208;high security&#8212;allowing only one out of approximately two million keys to unlock the data. This study pioneers the first chiral cryptographic key in fluorescence encryption, paving the way for ultra&#8208;secure encryption, advanced chiral sensing, and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SE) cells hold great promise for electrochemical synthesis of pure H2O2, yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR) in such systems, particularly when using pure water as the proton source, remain unclear. While both Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H&#8208;mediated) and Eley&#8208;Rideal (ER, water&#8208;derived proton&#8208;coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, their practical dominance under SE conditions has locked experimental validation. Herein, we designed a hierarchical Ni&#8208;N2&#8208;C&#8208;O single&#8208;atom/NiO nanocluster co&#8208;decorated porous carbon nanosheet catalyst (NiSA&#8208;NiO/pCNs) that achieved exceptional 2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR performance, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a H2O2 partial current density of 356 mA cm&#8722;2 (equivalent to 6.6 mmol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 production rate) in a membrane&#8208;free SE cell. Through detailed analysis of reaction intermediates and the local pH using in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect and density functional theory simulations, we demonstrated the critical role of NiO nanoclusters in tuning the protonation pathway: the water dissociation (WD) capability of NiO activates the ER mechanism via fast proton transfer from solvent water, whereas NiSA/pCNs without NiO preferentially follow the LH mechanism through surface&#8208;adsorbed *H intermediates from the interfacial transferred proton. These findings establish a catalyst design principle for controlling interfacial proton transfer routes in solid&#8208;state H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Eley&#8208;Rideal Mechanism in Electrochemical Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Eley&#8208;Rideal (ER) mechanism is pivotal in heterogeneous catalysis processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, which rely heavily on the interaction between solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;phase species. In this study, we examine the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene to explore the factors influencing the ER mechanism. We employed the density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the hydrogenation of acetylene on face&#8208;centered cubic metals and copper&#8208;based alloys. Microkinetic modeling identifies changes in the rate&#8208;determining steps of different alloys as electronegativity decreases. We then constructed the volcano plot for the adsorption energy towards C2H2 and the reaction rate, which predicted that Cu3Au is the best candidate alloy for the C2H2 semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Both extensive prior research and our experimental findings validated our volcano plot. Notably, our work points out the two key determinants of the ER mechanism: atomic activation and steric hindrance. For metals with weaker adsorption, steric hindrance primarily obstructs the ER mechanism, while for metals with stronger adsorption, the ER mechanism is hindered due to the challenge of atomic activation. Therefore, introducing weak adsorption sites into moderately adsorptive metals can improve the overall efficiency of the ER reaction by balancing these two factors.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Porous Aromatic Framework Cathode with Fast Redox Kinetics for Ultralow&#8208;Temperature (&#8208;70 &#8451;) Potassium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 A g&#8208;1) at 25 &#8451;. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;20 &#8451; and 130.1 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;40 &#8451; at 0.2 A g&#8208;1). Even at &#8208;70 &#8451;, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8208; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.</dc:description>

However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor-acceptor (D-A) porous aromatic framework (PAF-310) using p-type phenazine (PZ) and n-type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low-temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF-310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g-1 at 50 A g-1) at 25 &#8451;. Furthermore, PAF-310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low-temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g-1 at -20 &#8451; and 130.1 mAh g-1 at -40 &#8451; at 0.2 A g-1). Even at -70 &#8451;, PAF-310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1). Moreover, various in/ex-situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co-storage mechanism of K+ and PF6- in PAF-310.

         <title>Regioselective C&#8208;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform = H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.</dc:description>
