         <title>Combination of Knoevenagel Polycondensation and Water&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Michael&#8208;Addition&#8208;Elimination for the Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs), belonging to the class of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties. Despite the successful synthesis, it remains elusive for the relevant polymerization mechanism, which leads to relatively low crystallinity and poor reproducibility. In this work, we demonstrate the novel synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs via the combination of Knoevenagel polycondensation and water&#8208;assisted dynamic Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination, abbreviated as KMAE polymerization. The existence of C=C bond exchange between two diphenylacrylonitriles (M1 and M6) is firstly confirmed via in&#8208;situ high&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy study of model reactions. Notably, the intermediate M4 synthesized via Michael&#8208;addition can proceed the Michael&#8208;elimination quantitatively, leading to an efficient C=C bond exchange, unambiguously confirming the dynamic nature of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination. Furthermore, the addition of water can significantly promote the reaction rate of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for highly efficient C=C bond exchange within 5 mins. As a result, the KMAE polymerization provides a highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by four examples of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;BDAN, and V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN, based on the simulated and experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns as well as N2&#8208;adsorption&#8208;desorption measurements. Moreover, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;TEM) analysis shows crystalline domain sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm for the newly synthesized V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vinylene-linked two-dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V-2D-COFs), belonging to the class of two-dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;-conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)-substituted V-2D-COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties.

         <title>A Water&#8208;soluble Highly Oxidizing Cobalt Molecular Catalyst Designed for Bioinspired Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt complex supported by a dianionic 2,2'&#8208;([2,2'&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6'&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold, which is a rare example of a high&#8208;oxidation species, as demonstrated by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical data. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the Co  IV  center of the mononuclear complex in the solid state resides in the high (sextet, S = 5/2) spin state. The complex can effectively catalyze water oxidation via a single&#8208;site water nucleophilic attack pathway with an overpotential of only 360 mV in phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. The key intermediate toward water oxidation was speculated by theoretical calculations and was identified by in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The results are important to the accessibility of high&#8208;oxidation state metal species in synthetic models for achieving robust and reactive oxidation catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the Length Limit of Dihydrodiboraacenes: Synthesis and Characterizations of Boron&#8208;Embedded Heptacene and Nonacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes (boraacenes) have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science. However, extending the skeleton of boraacenes to higher acenes (N &#8805; 6) is synthetically challenging because of their limited stability under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of boron&#8208;embedded heptacene (  DBH  ) and nonacene (  DBN  ) as the hitherto longest boraacenes. The former is highly stable (even after 240 h in tetrahydrofuran) while the latter is air&#8208;sensitive with the half&#8208;life (  t  1/2  ) of 11.8 min. The structures of both compounds are verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing a linear backbone with an antiaromatic C  4  B  2  core. Photophysical characterizations associated with theoretical calculations indicate that both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable  DBH  manifests an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#177;2% and can be chemically reduced to its radical anion and dianion states, implying the value of boron&#8208;doped higher acenes as novel functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>K3SbS4 as a Potassium Superionic Conductor with Low Activation Energy for K&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state K&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are key elements to address the current problems in K secondary batteries. Here, we report a sulfide&#8208;based K&#8208;ion conductor K  3  SbS  4  with a low activation energy of 0.27 eV. W&#8208;doped K  3&#8208;x  Sb  1&#8208;x  W  x  S  4  (x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12) compounds were also explored for increasing vacancy concentrations and improving ionic conductivity. Among them, K  2.92  Sb  0.92  W  0.08  S  4  exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10  &#8208;4  S/cm at 40 &#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium ion conductors at ambient temperature. In addition, K  2.92  Sb  0.92  W  0.08  S  4  is electrochemical stable with long&#8208;chained potassium polysulfide of K  2  S  x  . A room&#8208;temperature solid potassium&#8208;sulfur (K&#8208;S) battery system has therefore been successfully demonstrated, which is the first K&#8208;S battery prototype using non&#8208;commercial inorganic&#8208;based electrolyte to block the polysulfide shuttle.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Spin State of Fe Center by Bridge Bonded Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti Ligands for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring functional substrates and precisely regulating the electronic structures of atomic metal active species with moderate spin state are of great importance yet remain challenging. Here, we provide an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligand regulated spin&#8208;state transition strategy to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe centers. Theoretical calculations firstly indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands in FeN3O&#8208;O&#8208;Ti can induce the low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin state transition and O2  adsorption optimization of FeN3O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the oriented catalyst was prepared from atomic&#8208;Fe doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots and ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene. The optimal catalyst exhibits an intrinsic activity that is almost 5 times higher than the contrast sample (without axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands). Moreover, it also delivers a superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery and H2  /O2  anion exchange membrane fuel cell in a wide&#8208;temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Microsecond Backbone Motions Modulate the Oligomerization of the DNAJB6 Chaperone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAJB6 is a prime example of an anti&#8208;aggregation chaperone that functions as an oligomer. DNAJB6 oligomers are dynamic and subunit exchange is critical for inhibiting client protein aggregation. The T193A mutation in the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of DNAJB6 reduces both chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation of client proteins, and has recently been linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Here, we show by NMR, including relaxation&#8208;based methods, that the T193A mutation has minimal effects on the structure of the &#946;&#8208;stranded CTD but increases the population and rate of formation of a partially folded state. The results can be rationalized in terms of &#946;&#8208;strand peptide plane flips that occur on a timescale of ~100 &#956;s and lead to global changes in the overall pleat/flatness of the CTD, thereby altering its ability to oligomerize. These findings help forge a link between chaperone dynamics/ oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation activity which may possibly lead to new therapeutic avenues tuned to target specific substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylindoles via Atroposelective Cyclization of Ynamides Catalyzed by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, asymmetric catalysis of ynamides has attracted much attention, but these reactions mostly constructed central chirality, except for few examples on the synthesis of axially chiral compounds which exclusively relied on noble&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, a facile access to axially chiral N&#8208;heterocycles enabled by chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, organocatalysts and ligands based on such axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole skeletons are demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Performance Descriptors in CO2 Hydrogenation over Iron&#8208;based Catalysts Promoted with Alkali Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal promoters have been widely employed for preparation of heterogeneous catalysts used in many industrially important reactions. However, the fundamentals of their effects are usually difficult to access. Herein, we unravel mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the role of alkali metals in CO2  hydrogenation over Fe&#8208;based catalysts through the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques, spatially resolved steady&#8208;state and transient kinetic analyses. The promoters affect electronic properties of iron in iron carbides. These carbide characteristics determine catalyst ability to activate H2  , CO and CO2  . The Allen scale electronegativity of alkali metal promoter was successfully correlated with the rates of CO2  hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons and CH4  as well as with the rate constants of individual steps of CO or CO2  activation . The derived knowledge can be valuable for designing and preparation of catalysts applied in other reactions where such promoters are also used.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterotrimetallic Double Cavity Cages: Syntheses and Selective Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of two heterotrimetallic double cavity cages, [PdnPtmL4]6+, (where n=1 and m =2 or n=2 and m=1) is described. The cages are shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The cage with two identical cavities can bind two identical guest molecules in a non&#8208;cooperative fashion, whereas the cage with two different cavities can bind two different guests in a segregated manner.







Abstract
A strategy for the generation of heterotrimetallic double cavity (DC) cages [PdnPtmL4]6+ (DC1: n=1, m=2; and DC2: n=2, m=1) is reported. The DC cages were generated by combining an inert platinum(II) tetrapyridylaldehyde complex with a suitably substituted pyridylamine and PdII ions. 1H and DOSY nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data were consistent with the formation of the DC architectures. DC1 and DC2 were shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The structure of DC1, which features two identical cavities, binding two 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DAQ) guest molecules was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, DC1 was shown to bind two molecules of 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) in a statistical (non&#8208;cooperative) manner. In contrast, DC2, which features two different cage cavities, was found to interact with two different guests, 5&#8208;FU and cisplatin, selectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure Sulfoxides by Concurrent Photocatalytic Oxidation and Biocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of biocatalysis and photocatalysis was combined in one pot for a concurrent reduction&#8211;oxidation sequence to gain access to enantiopure sulfoxides. In a cyclic deracemization process the enantioselective biocatalytic reduction is followed by a non&#8208;stereoselective light&#8208;dependent oxidation to yield the desired target compounds in &gt;99&#8201;% ee. rac&#8208;sulfoxides carrying various substituents on the aromatic ring were well accepted by the system.







Abstract
The concurrent operation of chemical and biocatalytic reactions in one pot is still a challenging task, and, in particular for chemical photocatalysts, examples besides simple cofactor recycling systems are rare. However, especially due to the complementary chemistry that the two fields of catalysis promote, their combination in one pot has the potential to unlock intriguing, unprecedented overall reactivities. Herein we demonstrate a concurrent biocatalytic reduction and photocatalytic oxidation process. Specifically, the enantioselective biocatalytic sulfoxide reduction using (S)&#8208;selective methionine sulfoxide reductases was coupled to an unselective light&#8208;dependent sulfoxidation. Protochlorophyllide was established as a new green photocatalyst for the sulfoxidation. Overall, a cyclic deracemization process to produce nonracemic sulfoxides was achieved and the target compounds were obtained with excellent conversions (up to 91&#8201;%) and superb optical purity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee).

     alt="Synthesis of Enantiopure Sulfoxides by Concurrent Photocatalytic Oxidation and Biocatalytic Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of biocatalysis and photocatalysis was combined in one pot for a concurrent reduction&#8211;oxidation sequence to gain access to enantiopure sulfoxides. In a cyclic deracemization process the enantioselective biocatalytic reduction is followed by a non-stereoselective light-dependent oxidation to yield the desired target compounds in &amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee. rac-&lt;/i&gt;sulfoxides carrying various substituents on the aromatic ring were well accepted by the system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concurrent operation of chemical and biocatalytic reactions in one pot is still a challenging task, and, in particular for chemical photocatalysts, examples besides simple cofactor recycling systems are rare. However, especially due to the complementary chemistry that the two fields of catalysis promote, their combination in one pot has the potential to unlock intriguing, unprecedented overall reactivities. Herein we demonstrate a concurrent biocatalytic reduction and photocatalytic oxidation process. Specifically, the enantioselective biocatalytic sulfoxide reduction using (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-selective methionine sulfoxide reductases was coupled to an unselective light-dependent sulfoxidation. Protochlorophyllide was established as a new green photocatalyst for the sulfoxidation. Overall, a cyclic deracemization process to produce nonracemic sulfoxides was achieved and the target compounds were obtained with excellent conversions (up to 91&#8201;%) and superb optical purity (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Critical Role of Removing Impurities in Nickel Oxide on High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles have been synthesized via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). The inverted perovskite solar cell based on a NiOx&#8208;IL hole transport layer exhibits a striking efficiency exceeding 22.62&#8201;%, and a superior operational stability maintaining 92&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at a maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
The performance enhancement of inverted perovskite solar cells applying nickel oxide (NiOx) as the hole transport layer (HTL) has been limited by impurity ions (such as nitrate ions). Herein, we have proposed a strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). Experimental and theoretical results illustrate that the cation of the ionic liquid can inhibit the adsorption of impurity ions on nickel hydroxide through a strong hydrogen bond and low adsorption energy, thereby obtaining NiOx&#8208;IL HTL with high conductivity and strong hole&#8208;extraction ability. Importantly, the removal of impurity ions can effectively suppress the redox reaction between the NiOx film and the perovskite film, thus slowing down the deterioration of device performance. Consequently, the modified inverted device shows a striking efficiency exceeding 22.62&#8201;%, and superior stability maintaining 92&#8201;% efficiency at a maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Assisted Aqueous Manganese&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton intercalation chemistry was introduced in aqueous manganese&#8208;ion cells, in which the layered Al0.1V2O5&#8901;1.5&#8201;H2O cathode exhibits a consequent Mn2+ and H+ ion intercalation/extraction mechanism. Such an energy release/storage process contributes to high capacity, fast kinetics and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Aqueous manganese&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) are promising energy storage systems because of the distinctive merits of Mn metal, in terms of high abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. Conventional MIBs are based on the Mn2+ ion storage mechanism, whereas the capacity in cathode materials is generally limited due to the high charge density and large solvated ionic radius of Mn2+ ions in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, proton intercalation chemistry is introduced in aqueous MIBs, in which the layered Al0.1V2O5&#8901;1.5&#8201;H2O (AlVO) cathode exhibits a consequent Mn2+ and H+ ion intercalation/extraction process. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance, including high capacity, fast reaction kinetics and stable cycling behavior. Benefiting from this proton intercalation chemistry, the aqueous Mn||AlVO cells could deliver high specific energy and power simultaneously. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance aqueous MIBs.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Dynamic Microbial Fe(III) Respiration Metabolism with a Living Cell&#8208;Compatible Electron&#8208;Sensing Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ was developed to achieve dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism monitoring in S. putrefaciens. With excellent monitoring performance, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe offers the potential to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response of S. putrefaciens to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Additionally, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for biosynthesis efficiency optimization.







Abstract
Monitoring microbial metabolism is vital for biomanufacturing processes optimization. However, it remains a grand challenge to offer insight into microbial metabolism due to particularly complex and dynamic processes. Here, we report an electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ for real&#8208;time and dynamic monitoring of Fe(III) respiration metabolism. The quenched persistent luminescence of Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ is recovered when Fe3+ accepted electrons from the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism, enabling the real&#8208;time monitoring of microbial metabolism. The probe shows the capability to verify the role of related biomolecules in microbial Fe(III) respiration metabolism, to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Furthermore, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for improving biosynthesis efficiency by monitoring Fe redox recycling in microbial co&#8208;culture.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Embedded [n]Helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach has been used to synthesize azulene&#8208;embedded pristine [n]helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7) that show low&#8208;lying first electric states, small optical energy gaps, and anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. These azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes contribute to the non&#8208;benzenoid helicene library and allow structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.







Abstract
Azulene is a non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic building block with unique chemical structure and physicochemical properties. By using the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthetic strategy, we synthesized three azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes ([n]AzHs, n=5, 6 and 7), in which one terminal azulene subunit was fused with n&#8208;2 benzene rings. P&#8208; and M&#8208;enantiomers were observed in the packing diagrams of [5]&#8208;, and [6]AzHs. However, P&#8208; and M&#8208;[7]AzHs could be isolated by recrystallization of the racemic mixture. These [n]AzHs were endowed with new properties through the azulene moiety such as low&#8208;lying first electric state (S1), small optical energy gap and anti&#8208;Kasha emission. [6]&#8208;, and [7]AzHs exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (gabs) maxima of about 0.02, which is among the highest |gabs| values of helicenes in the visible range. These azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes contribute to the non&#8208;benzenoid helicene library and allow the structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.

These &lt;b&gt;[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]AzHs&lt;/b&gt; were endowed with new properties through the azulene moiety such as low-lying first electric state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), small optical energy gap and &lt;i&gt;anti-&lt;/i&gt;Kasha emission. &lt;b&gt;[6]-&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;[7]AzHs&lt;/b&gt; exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (g&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;) maxima of about 0.02, which is among the highest |g&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;| values of helicenes in the visible range. These azulene-embedded [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]helicenes contribute to the non-benzenoid helicene library and allow the structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Caging Enables the Control of Endogenous DNA Alkyltransferase Activity with Light inside Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first control of endogenous human O6&#8208;alkylguanine&#8208;DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) activity with light in live cells via the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging strategy without genetic engineering is reported. The light&#8208;responsive alkylated AGT is dealkylated for the first time to recover the DNA repair activity in breast cancer MCF&#8208;7 cells by the dose&#8208;dependent light irradiation.







Abstract
The control of endogenous protein activity with light inside live cells is helpful for the high spatiotemporal probing of their dynamic roles. Herein, we report the first small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging approach to control the endogenous human O6&#8208;alkylguanine&#8208;DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) activity with light, and the caged AGT is constructed from the native intracellular AGT. The photo&#8208;responsive O6&#8208;benzylguanine derivative O6&#8208;NBG3 is developed to site&#8208;specifically cage the AGT&#8242;s catalytic cysteine residue, and the light irradiation on&#8208;demand restores AGT&#8242;s activity in vitro, in bacteria, and in mammalian cells. With O6&#8208;NBG3, the alkylated AGT is dealkylated for the first time to recover the DNA repair activity in breast cancer MCF&#8208;7 cells by the dose&#8208;dependent light irradiation. This decaging strategy enables the localized modulation of endogenous AGT activity with high temporal precision without genetic engineering, which holds great potential for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Extreme Enhancement of Carbon Hydrogasification via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plants capture CO2 from the air and fix it with H2O into carbohydrate molecules via photosynthesis. The main photosynthesized biomass, wood, can be converted into charcoal and chemicals via pyrolysis. The charcoal can then be hydrogenated into hydrocarbons using a mechanochemical method. The produced CH4 can be used directly as fuel, or as a feedstock for the synthesis of other chemicals, thereby creating a neutral or negative carbon cycle.







Abstract
Carbon hydrogasification is the slowest reaction among all carbon&#8208;involved small&#8208;molecule transformations. Here, we demonstrate a mechanochemical method that results in both a faster reaction rate and a new synthesis route. The reaction rate was dramatically enhanced by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional thermal method. Simultaneously, the reaction exhibited very high selectivity (99.8&#8201;% CH4, versus 80&#8201;% under thermal conditions) with a cobalt catalyst. Our study demonstrated that this extreme increase in reaction rate originates from the continuous activation of reactive carbon species via mechanochemistry. The high selectivity is intimately related to the activation at low temperature, at which higher hydrocarbons are difficult to form. This work is expected to advance studies of carbon hydrogasification, and other solid&#8208;gas reactions.

         <title>Demonstrating and Unraveling a Controlled Nanometer&#8208;Scale Expansion of the Vacancy Defects in Graphene by CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancies is desired for molecular separation, sensing and electronics applications. Unfortunately, available etching methods always lead to vacancy nucleation making it challenging to control etching. Herein, we report CO2  &#8208;led controlled etching down to 2&#8211;3 &#197; per minute while completely avoiding vacancy nucleation. This makes CO2  a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion. We show that CO2  expands the steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free edges with an activation energy of 2.71 eV, corresponding to the energy barrier for the dissociative chemisorption of CO2  . We demonstrate the presence of an additional configurational energy barrier for nanometer&#8208;sized vacancies resulting in a significantly slower rate of expansion. Finally, CO2  etching is applied to map the location of the intrinsic vacancies in the polycrystalline graphene film where we show that the intrinsic vacancy defects manifest mainly as grain boundary defects where intragrain defects from oxidative etching constitute a minor population.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Driven by the development of new functional inks, inkjet&#8208;printed electronics has reached several milestones by moving from the integration of simple electronic elements (e.g., temperature and pressure sensors, RFID antennas, etc.) to high&#8208;tech application fields (  e.g  . optoelectronics, energy storage and harvesting, medical diagnosis). Currently, inkjet printing techniques suffer from spatial resolution higher than several micrometers, a redhibitory threshold for miniaturization and for many applications that require to control organization of constituents at the nanometer scale. In this review, we present the physico&#8208;chemical concepts and the equipment constraints underpinning the resolution limit of inkjet printing method and point out the input of molecular, supramolecular and nanomaterial&#8208;based approaches for their circumvention. Based on these considerations, we propose future trajectories for inkjet&#8208;printing resolution improvement that will be driven and supported by breakthroughs coming from chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanographene with Multiple Embedded Heptagons: Cascade Radical Photocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization was used in the synthesis of nanocarbons with embedded heptagons, providing a new approach towards nanocarbons with novel topologies. The nanographene reported herein bears six heptagons, representing the nanocarbon containing largest number of heptagons by organic synthesis reported to date. The embedded heptagons distort the graphene core into a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
Although heptagons are widely found in graphenic materials, the precise synthesis of nanocarbons containing heptagons remains a challenge, especially for the nanocarbons containing multiple&#8208;heptagons. Herein, we show that photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization (PIRC) can be used to synthesize multi&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded nanocarbons. Notably, a nanographene containing six heptagons (1) was obtained via a six&#8208;fold cascade PIRC reaction. The structure of 1 was clearly validated and showed a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation. Experimental bond analysis and theoretical calculations indicated that the heptagons in 1 were non&#8208;aromatic, whereas the peripheral rings were highly aromatic. Compared to planar nanographene with the same number of &#960; electrons, 1 had a similar optical gap due to a compromise between the decreased conjugation in the wrapped structure and enhanced electronic delocalization at the rim. Electrochemical studies showed that 1 had low&#8208;lying oxidation potentials, which was attributed to the nitrogen&#8208;doping.

         <title>Rapid Access to Multisubstituted Acrylamides from Cyclic Ketones via Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of enol triflates has been developed for rapid, modular and regioselective synthesis of multisubstituted acrylamides from simple ketones. The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and the use of bulky secondary amide&#8208;derived norbornenes appears to be a key parameter to maintain high efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
A strategy to access diverse multisubstituted acrylamides from cyclic ketones is realized via palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;carbamoylation and ipso&#8208;functionalization of the corresponding enol triflates. The development of bulky C2 secondary amide&#8208;substituted norbornene cocatalysts is the key to achieve the desired reactivity and selectivity. Readily available carbamoyl chlorides serve as effective electrophiles; various moieties including alkenyl, hydrogen, alkynyl, aryl, and alkyl groups can be installed at the ipso position. In addition, tandem &#945;&#8208;carbamoylation/ipso&#8208;annulations are demonstrated to furnish lactam&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds. The utility of this method is exemplified in the streamlined preparation of a platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF)&#8208;antagonist.

         <title>Boosting Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Synergistic Photoelectric Effect and Plasmonic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;field assisted strategy is presented to boost cycling stability (86.9&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency after 100 cycles at 0.10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and rate capability at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of a Li&#8211;CO2 battery based on the synergetic photoelectric effect of TiO2 and plasmonic interaction of silver nanoparticles.







Abstract
Sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution kinetics at cathodes seriously impede the realistic applications of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Herein, synergistic photoelectric effect and plasmonic interaction are introduced to accelerate CO2 reduction/evolution reactions by designing a silver nanoparticle&#8208;decorated titanium dioxide nanotube array cathode. The incident light excites energetic photoelectrons/holes in titanium dioxide to overcome reaction barriers, and induces the intensified electric field around silver nanoparticles to enable effective separation/transfer of photogenerated carriers and a thermodynamically favorable reaction pathway. The resulting Li&#8211;CO2 battery demonstrates ultra&#8208;low charge voltage of 2.86&#8197;V at 0.10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, good cycling stability with 86.9&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency after 100 cycles, and high rate capability at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work offers guidance on rational cathode design for advanced Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and beyond.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Elastomers from Stereochemistry&#8208;Directed Hydrogen Bonding in Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemical configuration of the rigid&#8208;ring structures of isosorbide (ISPU) and isomannide (IMPU) direct strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions which impart unique properties including strain&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent behavior, significant strain hardening, and high optical clarity that are not possible using other chemical approaches to elastomer design.







Abstract
The remarkable elasticity and tensile strength found in natural elastomers are challenging to mimic. Synthetic elastomers typically feature covalently cross&#8208;linked networks (rubbers), but this hinders their reprocessability. Physical cross&#8208;linking via hydrogen bonding or ordered crystallite domains can afford reprocessable elastomers, but often at the cost of performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;tough, reprocessable elastomers based on linear alternating polymers. The incorporation of a rigid isohexide adjacent to urethane moieties affords elastomers with exceptional strain hardening, strain rate dependent behavior, and high optical clarity. Distinct differences were observed between isomannide and isosorbide&#8208;based elastomers where the latter displays superior tensile strength and strain recovery. These phenomena are attributed to the regiochemical irregularities in the polymers arising from their distinct stereochemistry and respective inter&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding.

         <title>The Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Generated Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular imprinting and using a unique enzyme, for the first time, the protein&#8208;templated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;generated aptamers (EGAs) against a protein target is demonstrated which shows enhanced binding compared to a control. This suggests that EGAs can be formed through dynamic interactions between the EGAs and the target protein as well as competition for binding EGAs between the enzyme and the target.







Abstract
Inspired by the chemical synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers, we demonstrated for the first time, the protein&#8208;target mediated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;generated aptamers (EGAs). We prepared pre&#8208;polymerisation mixtures containing different ratios of nucleotides, an initiator sequence and protein template and incubated each mixture with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Upon purification and rebinding of the EGAs against the target, we observed an enhancement in binding of templated&#8208;EGAs towards the target compared to a non&#8208;templated control. These results demonstrate the presence of two primary mechanisms for the formation of EGAs, namely, the binding of random sequences to the target as observed in systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and the dynamic competition between TdT enzyme and the target protein for binding of EGAs during synthesis. The latter mechanism serves to increase the stringency of EGA&#8208;based screening and represents a new way to develop aptamers that relies on rational design.

         <title>Atom Swapping on Aromatic Rings: Conversion from Phosphinine Pincer Metal Complexes to Metallabenzenes Triggered by O2 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic method for metallabenzene was developed in which a phosphorus atom in a phosphinine ring is swapped with transition metal fragments. The oxidation of a phosphinine pincer iridium complex by O2 afforded iridabenzene via exchange of the phosphorus atom and the iridium fragment. Dianionic rhodabenzene was synthesized by O2 oxidation of an analogous rhodium complex, followed by reduction by metallic potassium.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel method for the synthesis of metallabenzenes by swapping the phosphorus atom in an aromatic phosphinine ring with transition metal fragments. The oxidation of a phosphine&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;phosphine pincer iridium complex by O2 triggered the replacement of the phosphorus atom of the phosphinine ring by an iridium fragment to afford iridabenzene. Dianionic rhodabenzene was also synthesized from a phosphinine rhodium complex by oxidation of the phosphorus atom, followed by subsequent reduction using metallic potassium. The aromaticity of the newly synthesized irida&#8208; and rhoda&#8208;benzenes was evaluated both experimentally and theoretically.

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular machine is presented that uses the light&#8208;powered unidirectional rotation trajectory of a molecular motor to actively thread a tetraethylene glycol chain through a macrocyclic ring. This molecular setup thus realizes the miniaturization of macroscopic threading providing a fundamental entry step into mechanical molecular weaving or sewing processes.







Abstract
Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano&#8208;scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a &#8220;molecular knitting&#8221; counterpart.

         <title>Increasing the Number of Aluminum Atoms in T3 Sites of a Mordenite Zeolite by Low&#8208;Pressure SiCl4 Treatment to Catalyze Dimethyl Ether Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST), the undesired framework aluminum atoms in the 12&#8208;MR channels of a mordenite (MOR) zeolite migrate to the desired T3 sites to increase the number of favorable active sites.







Abstract
Controlling the location of aluminum atoms in a zeolite framework is critical for understanding structure&#8211;performance relationships of catalytic reaction systems and tailoring catalyst design. Herein, we report a strategy to preferentially relocate mordenite (MOR) framework Al atoms into the desired T3 sites by low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST). High&#8208;field 27Al NMR was used to identify the exact location of framework Al for the MOR samples. The results indicate that 73&#8201;% of the framework Al atoms were at the T3 sites after LPST under optimal conditions, which leads to controllably generating and intensifying active sites in MOR zeolite for the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction with higher methyl acetate (MA) selectivity and much longer lifetime (25&#8197;times). Further research reveals that the Al relocation mechanism involves simultaneous extraction, migration, and reinsertion of Al atoms from and into the parent MOR framework. This unique method is potentially applicable to other zeolites to control Al location.

         <title>A Morphing [4Fe&#8208;3S&#8208;nO]&#8208;Cluster within a Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange of one amino acid (Cys&#8208;&gt;Glu) coordinating the Ni/Fe/S&#8208;cluster in carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODH) is the main difference resulting in the formation of a Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster, found in CooS&#8208;V, while conserving the overall architecture of CODHs. The Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster in CooS&#8208;V reversibly rearranges dependent on its redox&#8208;state.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO. Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster. Here, we report on the structure and reactivity of such a deviant enzyme, termed CooS&#8208;VCh. Its structure reveals the typical CODH scaffold, but contains an iron&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxo hybrid&#8208;cluster. Although closely related to true CODHs, CooS&#8208;VCh catalyzes neither CO oxidation, nor CO2 reduction. The active site of CooS&#8208;VCh undergoes a redox&#8208;dependent restructuring between a reduced [4Fe&#8208;3S]&#8208;cluster and an oxidized [4Fe&#8208;2S&#8208;S*&#8208;2O&#8208;2(H2O)]&#8208;cluster. Hydroxylamine, a slow&#8208;turnover substrate of CooS&#8208;VCh, oxidizes the hybrid&#8208;cluster in two structurally distinct steps. Overall, minor changes in CODHs are sufficient to accommodate a Fe/S/O&#8208;cluster in place of the Ni,Fe&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;cluster of CODHs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorescent Block Copolymer Micelles with Responsive Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The encapsulation of Schiff base&#8208;like zinc(II) complexes into micelles derived from polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) diblock copolymers that offer coordination sites was investigated. Incorporation and ligation results in strongly emissive micelles with enhanced quantum yields and thermal stability compared to the neat complex in pyridine. The responsivity towards medium and acidity was utilized to design a turn&#8208;on emission sensor material upon micelle formation.







Abstract
Responsive fluorescent materials offer a high potential for sensing and (bio&#8208;)imaging applications. To investigate new concepts for such materials and to broaden their applicability, the previously reported non&#8208;fluorescent zinc(II) complex [Zn(L)] that shows coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission was encapsulated into a family of non&#8208;fluorescent polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles leading to brightly emissive materials. Coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission upon incorporation and ligation of the [Zn(L)] in the P4VP core outperform parent [Zn(L)] in pyridine solution with respect to lifetimes, quantum yields, and temperature resistance. The quantum yield can be easily tuned by tailoring the selectivity of the employed solvent or solvent mixture and, thus, the tendency of the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP diblock copolymers to self&#8208;assemble into micelles. A medium&#8208;dependent off&#8211;on sensor upon micelle formation could be established by suppression of non&#8208;micelle&#8208;borne emission background pertinent to chloroform through controlled acidification indicating an additional pH&#8208;dependent process.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroalkynylation of Unactivated 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is reported. Taking advantage of amide coordination and ligand control, both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkynylation were readily accessible with high enantioselectivities. Computational studies revealed the origin of the ligand&#8208;controlled change of regioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective functionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is challenging due to the difficulty to discriminate the enantiotopic faces. Enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity remains elusive. We report here an amide&#8208;directed, regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated alkenes. The regioselectivity can be readily tuned by the choice of a proper ligand. Catalytic alkynylations occurred with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity to afford products containing acyclic tertiary or quaternary stereocenters &#946; to an amide. Combining a sequence of alkene isomerization and regioselective hydroalkynylation, we further realized an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal asymmetric conjugated alkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity is dictated by the ligand structures.

         <title>Highly Stable and Reactive Platinum Single Atoms on Oxygen Plasma&#8208;Functionalized CeO2 Surfaces: Nanostructuring and Peroxo Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports have recently become increasingly interesting catalytic materials. Nonetheless, their non&#8208;trivial preparation and limited thermal and environmental stability constitutes an issue for their potential applications. Here we demonstrate that an oxygen plasma pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO  2  ) surface serves to anchor Pt single atoms, making them active and resistant towards sintering in the CO oxidation reaction. Through a combination of experimental results obtained on well&#8208;defined CeO  2  films and theory, we show that the O  2  plasma causes surface nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo (O  2  2&#8208;  ) species, favoring the uniform and dense distribution of isolated strongly bonded Pt  2+  atoms. The promotional effect of the plasma treatment was further demonstrated on the powder Pt/CeO  2  catalysts. We believe that plasma functionalization can be applied to other metal/oxide systems to achieve tunable and stable catalysts with a high density of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Based Linear Nonalternant Nanoribbons with Bright Emission and Ambipolar Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report stepwise solution&#8208;synthesis of linear nonalternant nanoribbons (  NNRs  ), featuring pentagonal rings  peri  &#8208;fused onto the repeating perylene unit. The X&#8208;ray single crystal structures demonstrated their &#960;&#8208;backbones as a twisted ribbon, with the longest crystalline length of the nanoribbon up to 3.9 nm.  NNRs  exhibited an orange to deep&#8208;red photoluminescence even under the room light, with absolute  &#934;  F  up to 82%, most likely due to ring&#8208;strain induced molecular stiffness. Benefiting from the enlarged size and the antiaromatic character of pentagons, all of  NNRs  possessed ambipolar redox properties, especially for longer nanoribbons showing multiple reversible reductions and oxidations. In addition, experimental and theoretical results indicated a ground state open&#8208;shell singlet diradicaloid for the dication of longer  NNRs  . Our studies reveal the intriguing nonalternant structures and physical properties of this type of nanoribbons, involving the striking effects of the multiple annulated pentagons, and also provide fundamental insights into their electronic structures</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Dyes Into Fluorophores: Exciton&#8208;Induced Emission with Chain&#8208;like Oligo&#8208;BODIPY Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a systematic study demonstrating to which extent exciton formation can amplify fluorescence based on a series of ethylene&#8208;bridged oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. A set of non&#8208; and weakly fluorescent BODIPY motifs was selected and transformed into discrete, chain&#8208;like oligomers by linkage via a flexible ethylene tether. The prepared superstructures constitute excitonically active entities with non&#8208;conjugated, Coulomb&#8208;coupled oscillators. The non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels of Internal Conversion (IC), also combined with an upstream reductive Photoelectron Transfer (rPET) and Intersystem Crossing (ISC) were addressed at the monomeric state and the evolution of fluorescence and (non&#8208;)radiative decay rates studied along the oligomeric series. We demonstrate that a &#8220;masked&#8221; fluorescence can be fully reactivated irrespective of the imposed conformational rigidity. This work challenges the paradigm that a collective fluorescence enhancement is limited to sterically induced motional restrictions.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding is an effective tool in solid&#8208;state supramolecular chemistry to stabilize crystal structures. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200236), Zhengxu Cai and co&#8208;workers introduced intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) into a host&#8212;guest room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system, achieving fluorescence&#8212;phosphorescence dual emission. The weak intermolecular interactions of the halogen bond are sensitive to external stimuli (heat, mechanical force and X&#8208;rays), realizing colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli response behavior.

Self&#8208;propulsion multifunctional microrobots harboring chiral supramolecular selectors represent a promising pathway for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; while employing different readouts (e.g., optical and electrical). The combination of different active compounds in a single architecture allows for a multifunctional microrobot that simultaneously exhibits chiral recognition, but also fluorescent properties and the ability to be magnetically navigable and propelled in the presence of a chemical fuel, as described by Martin Pumera and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116090).

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Observation of Structural Dynamics Triggering Excimer Formation in a Perylene Bisimide Folda&#8208;Dimer by Ultrafast Time&#8208;Domain Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excimer (a contraction of the excited&#8208;state dimer) is the most classical photoproduct which has been generally regarded as a trap site. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202114474), Hyungjun Kim, Frank W&#252;rthner, Dongho Kim and co&#8208;workers have captured the vibrational snapshots triggering the excimer formation and relaxation processes of the perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using the ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. Understanding the mechanism of the excimer provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

         <title>Tandem Macrolactone Synthesis: Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Exiguolide by a Macrocyclization/Transannular Pyran Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones were synthesized by integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition under gold and ruthenium catalysis. Single&#8208;step access to a variety of 14&#8208; to 20&#8208;membered macrolactones containing a tetrahydropyran ring was possible from readily available linear precursors in good yields and with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. A 13&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, an anticancer marine macrolide, showcased the feasibility of our domino reaction sequence for macrolactone synthesis and also demonstrated the power of transannular reactions for rapid assembly of the tetrahydropyran rings of the target natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Allylation of Unactivated Electron&#8208;Deficient Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles are widespread in pharmaceuticals but methods for their transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization remain limited. This report describes a general, mild, and effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of heterocyclic aromatic compounds, including pyridines, pyrazines, pyrimidines, pyridazines, triazines, benzimidazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, as well as 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;indoles. The exquisite selectivity for benzylic sites at the 2&#8208;position is hypothesized to be controlled by coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)  2  subverting generally presumed pKa&#8217;s of benzylic protons. Furthermore, the broad range of heterocyclic substrates, the diversity of electrophiles, and excellent functional group compatibility suggest its future application to synthesis of complex molecules and library diversification in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites Passivated Black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 toward Stable and Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites can effectively passivate and stabilize 3D perovskites for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To CsPbI  3  &#8208;based PSCs, the influence of high temperature annealing on LD perovskite passivation effect has to be taken into account due to the black&#8208;phase CsPbI  3  crystallization requires high temperature treatment, however, which has been rarely concerned so far. Here, the thermal stability of LD perovskites based on three hydrophobic organic ammonium salts and their passivation effect toward CsPbI  3  and the whole device performance, have been investigated. It is found that, phenyltrimethylammonium iodide (PTAI) and its corresponding LD perovskites exhibit excellent thermal stability. Further investigation reveals that PTAI&#8208;based LD perovskites are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, which not only enhance the phase stability of CsPbI  3  but also effectively suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a consequence, the champion PSC device based on CsPbI  3  exhibit a record efficiency of 21.0% with high stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanopore Sensing Assay Resolves Cascade Reactions in a Multienzyme System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic cascade reactions are widely used to synthesize complex molecules from simple precursors. The major underlying mechanism of cascade reactions is substrate channeling, where intermediates of different enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. Here, we report a nanopore sensing assay that allows accurate quantification of all the reaction intermediates and the product of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. A DNA&#8208;peptide complex is used as the initial substrate which undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages in solution. All the temporal changes of the intermediates and product can be obtained through nanopore translocation recordings. Furthermore, we find that in a confined environment such as liposome, substrate channeling occurs between two sets of the three enzymes. Our results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to determine and quantify substrate channeling effects, which is potentially useful for designing and evaluating multienzyme systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes: Synthesis, Structures, and Ring Reconstruction via Atom Transfer under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Buckybowls possess unique properties that can be tailored by embedding main group elements into their &#960;&#8208;scaffolds. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed for producing monoazadichalcogenasumanenes (4a/4b, 6a/6b, 7a/7b) derived from sumanene by replacing its three benzylic carbons with one nitrogen and two chalcogen atoms (S for 4a/4b, Se for 6a/6b, Te for 7a/7b). Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes are deeper &#960;&#8208;bowls than trichalcogensumanenes as C&#8211;N bond is much shorter than C&#8211;X (X = S, Se, Te). Particularly, bowl&#8208;depth of 4b (0.95 &#197;) is greater than that of corannulene (0.85 &#197;). The nitrogen atom donates electron density to the entire &#960;&#8208;system that makes monoazadichalcogenasumanenes electron&#8208;rich. Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes undergo ring reconstruction of chalcogenophene ring via transferring a chalcogen atom from one molecule to another under acidic conditions. It is found that both nitrogen and chalcogen atoms play crucial role on this reaction, including conversion rate and relative ratio of ring reconstruction products.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing GLUT1&#8208;Targeted Pro&#8208;oxidant Ascorbate for Synergistic Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#8208;O&#8208;substituted ascorbate&#8211;photosensitizer conjugate AA&#8208;EtNBS proved the benefits of exploiting ascorbate chemistry in GLUT1&#8208;targeted anticancer phototherapy. AA&#8208;EtNBS undergoes a reversible structural conversion of the ascorbate moiety in response to the redox environment, leading to a GLUT1&#8208;targeted pro&#8208;oxidant effect and synergistic phototherapeutic efficacy.







Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to realize effective photodynamic therapy (PDT), there is still a lack of therapeutic approaches concisely structured to mitigate the major obstacles of PDT in clinical applications. Herein, we report a molecular strategy exploiting ascorbate chemistry to enhance the efficacy of PDT in cancer cells overexpressing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). AA&#8208;EtNBS, a 5&#8208;O&#8208;substituted ascorbate&#8211;photosensitizer (PS) conjugate, undergoes a reversible structural conversion of the ascorbate moiety in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), thereby promoting its uptake in GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed KM12C colon cancer cells and perturbing tumor redox homeostasis, respectively. Due to the unique pro&#8208;oxidant role of ascorbate in tumor environments, AA&#8208;EtNBS effectively sensitized KM12C cancer cells prior to PS&#8208;mediated generation of superoxide radicals under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. AA&#8208;EtNBS successfully exhibited GLUT1&#8208;targeted synergistic therapeutic efficacy during PDT both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study outlines a promising strategy employing ascorbate both as a targeting unit for GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and redox homeostasis destruction agent, thereby enhancing therapeutic responses towards anticancer treatment when used in conjunction with conventional PDT.

     alt="Harnessing GLUT1-Targeted Pro-oxidant Ascorbate for Synergistic Phototherapeutics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5-O-substituted ascorbate&#8211;photosensitizer conjugate &lt;b&gt;AA-EtNBS&lt;/b&gt; proved the benefits of exploiting ascorbate chemistry in GLUT1-targeted anticancer phototherapy. &lt;b&gt;AA-EtNBS&lt;/b&gt; undergoes a reversible structural conversion of the ascorbate moiety in response to the redox environment, leading to a GLUT1-targeted pro-oxidant effect and synergistic phototherapeutic efficacy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive efforts to realize effective photodynamic therapy (PDT), there is still a lack of therapeutic approaches concisely structured to mitigate the major obstacles of PDT in clinical applications. Herein, we report a molecular strategy exploiting ascorbate chemistry to enhance the efficacy of PDT in cancer cells overexpressing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). &lt;b&gt;AA-EtNBS&lt;/b&gt;, a 5-O-substituted ascorbate&#8211;photosensitizer (PS) conjugate, undergoes a reversible structural conversion of the ascorbate moiety in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), thereby promoting its uptake in GLUT1-overexpressed KM12C colon cancer cells and perturbing tumor redox homeostasis, respectively. Due to the unique pro-oxidant role of ascorbate in tumor environments, &lt;b&gt;AA-EtNBS&lt;/b&gt; effectively sensitized KM12C cancer cells prior to PS-mediated generation of superoxide radicals under near-infrared (NIR) illumination. &lt;b&gt;AA-EtNBS&lt;/b&gt; successfully exhibited GLUT1-targeted synergistic therapeutic efficacy during PDT both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study outlines a promising strategy employing ascorbate both as a targeting unit for GLUT1-overexpressed cancer cells and redox homeostasis destruction agent, thereby enhancing therapeutic responses towards anticancer treatment when used in conjunction with conventional PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Concurrent Template Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Nanoparticles with Controllable Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general concurrent template strategy was reported for precise synthesis of mesoporous intermetallic nanoparticles with desired morphology, ordered mesostructure, and controlled intermetallic phases. The resultant mesoporous intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles exhibited the phase&#8208;dependent selectivity and excellent stability for selective hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene.







Abstract
We report a general concurrent template strategy for precise synthesis of mesoporous Pt&#8208;/Pd&#8208;based intermetallic nanoparticles with desired morphology and ordered mesostructure. The concurrent template not only supplies a mesoporous metal seed for re&#8208;crystallization growth of atomically ordered intermetallic phases with unique atomic stoichiometry but also provides a nanoconfinement environment for nanocasting synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles with ordered mesostructure and rhombic dodecahedral morphology under elevated temperature. Using the selective hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic reaction, mesoporous intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles exhibited remarkably controllable intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic selectivity and excellent catalytic stability. This work provides a very powerful strategy for precise preparation of ordered mesoporous intermetallic nanocrystals for application in selective catalysis and fuel cell electrocatalysis.

         <title>A Liquid Interfacial SERS Platform on a Nanoparticle Array Stabilized by Rigid Probes for the Quantification of Norepinephrine in Rat Brain Microdialysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Towards the challenge for reliable determination of trace chemicals in the brain, we created a SERS platform on functionalized AuNPs array formed at liquid/liquid interface in a uniform fashion over a large substrate area through ternary regulations for real&#8208;time quantification of trace norepinephrine (NE). The rigid molecule, 4&#8208;((4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;ylethynyl)&#8208;phenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;benzaldehyde (RP1) was designed and co&#8208;assembled at AuNPs with 4&#8208;mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) to chemically define NE via dual recognition. Meanwhile, the rigid structure assembly of RP1 and MPBA efficiently fixed interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis. Furthermore, Raman peak of C&#8801;C group in silent region was taken as response element to further improve the determination accuracy. Combining with microdialysis technique, this SERS platform was developed for in&#8208;the&#8208;field testing of NE in rat brain microdialysates followed by anxiety model.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3H&#8208;Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles represents an ideal approach to the synthesis of useful chiral indoline scaffolds. However, very few catalytic systems based on precious metals have been developed to realize this challenging reaction. Herein, we report a Mn&#8208;catalyzed AH of 3H&#8208;indoles with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic resolution of racemic 3H&#8208;indoles by AH was also achieved with high s&#8208;factors to construct quaternary stereocenters. Many acid&#8208;sensitive functional groups, which cannot be tolerated when using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ruthenium catalyst, were compatible with manganese catalysis. This new process expands the scope of this transformation and highlights the uniqueness of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis. The reaction could proceed with catalyst loadings at the parts per million (ppm) level with an exceptional turnover number of 72,350. This is the highest value yet reported for an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Substitution of Methyl Azaarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction of methyl azaarenes is described. Azaarenes such as (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline are all tolerated. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% yield and 99% ee). The utilization of the Knochel reagent TMPZnBr&#8226;LiBr warrants the direct formation of benzylic nucleophiles without additional activating reagents.  1  H NMR studies suggested a two&#8208;fold function of the Knochel reagent in this reaction. The synthetic utility of this method has been showcased by a concise enantioselective synthesis of an allosteric protein kinase modulator.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layered Cu5&#160;Nanoclusters on FeS2&#160;with Dual Catalytic Sites for Efficient and Selective H2O2&#160;Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the distribution of reactive oxygen species generated from H2O2 activation is the prerequisite to ensuring the efficient and safe use of H2O2 in the chemistry and life science fields. Herein, we demonstrate that constructing a dual Cu&#8208;Fe site through the self&#8208;assembly of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layered Cu5 nanoclusters onto FeS2 surface achieves selective H2O2 activation with high efficiency. Unlike its unitary Cu or Fe counterpart, the dual Cu&#8208;Fe sites residing at the perimeter zone of Cu5/FeS2 interface facilitate H2O2 adsorption and barrierless decomposition into &#8226;OH via forming a bridging Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;Fe complex. The robust in situ formation of &#8226;OH governed by this atomic&#8208;layered catalyst enables the effective oxidation of several refractory toxic pollutants across a broad pH range, including alachlor, sulfadimidine, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, p&#8208;chlorophenol, p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. This work highlights the concept of building a dual catalytic site in manipulating selective H2O2 activation on the surface molecular level towards efficient environmental control and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Guided Synthesis of a Mo/Zn Dual Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Synergistic Effect and Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a facile route to dual single&#8208;atom nanozyme composed of Zn and Mo utilizing the non&#8208;covalent nano&#8208;assembly of polyoxometalates and supramolecular coordination complexes as the metal atom precursor, and the macroscopic amphiphilic aerogel as the supporting substrate. The dual single&#8208;atom of Zn and Mo have high contents of 1.5 wt% and 7.3 wt%, which exhibit a synergistic effect and a peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The Zn/Mo site was identified as the main active center by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation. The detection of versatile analytes including intracellular H2O2, glucose in serum, cholesterol, and ascorbic acid in commercial beverages was achieved. The nanozyme had an outstanding stability and maintained its performance after one year&#8217;s storage. This study develops a new peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and provides a robust synthetic strategy for single&#8208;atom catalyst by utilizing the aerogel as a facile substrate that is capable in stabilizing various metal atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;based Kinematic Theory for Nanocrystal Morphology Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth of crystalline nanoparticles (NPs) generally involves three processes: nucleation, growth, and shape evolution. Among them, the shape evolution is less understood, despite the importance of morphology for NP properties. Here, we propose a symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate the process. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus (or seed) symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories. The theory accommodates the conventional criteria of the major existing theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking process during the growth of anisotropic structures. Furthermore, complex dendritic growth is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. Thus, it provides a framework to explain the shape evolution, and extends the morphogenesis prediction to cases, which cannot be treated by other theories.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Breslow Intermediates from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Aldehydes Involves Autocatalysis by the Breslow Intermediate, and a Hemiacetal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under aprotic conditions, the stoichiometric reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) such as imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes with aldehydes affords Breslow Intermediates (BIs), involving a formal 1,2&#8208;C&#8208;to&#8208;O proton shift. We herein report kinetic studies (NMR), complemented by DFT calculations, on the mechanism of this kinetically disfavored H&#8208;translocation. Variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) revealed that the kinetic orders of the reactants vary for different NHC&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde ratios, indicating different and ratio&#8208;dependent mechanistic regimes. We propose that for high NHC&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde ratios, the H&#8208;shift takes place in the primary, zwitterionic NHC&#8208;aldehyde adduct. With excess aldehyde, the zwitterion is in equilibrium with a hemiacetal, in which the H&#8208;shift occurs. In both regimes, the critical H&#8208;shift is auto&#8208;catalyzed by the BI. Kinetic isotope effects observed for R&#8208;CDO are in line with our proposal. Furthermore, we detected an H&#8208;bonded complex of the BI with excess NHC (NMR).</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe Bonding Regulates the Active Ni Sites of Ni&#8208;MOFs via Iron Doping and Decorating with FeOOH for Super&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
Iron doping and FeOOH decorating leads to interfacial Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding in Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;(Ni&#8208;MOF)/FeOOH. This interfacial bonding can regulate the active Ni site to give the appropriate adsorption behavior of intermediates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;(Ni&#8208;MOF)/FeOOH shows outstanding catalytic performance with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and high durability.







Abstract
The integration of Fe dopant and interfacial FeOOH into Ni&#8208;MOFs [Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;(Ni&#8208;MOFs)/FeOOH] to construct Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding is demonstrated and the origin of remarkable electrocatalytic performance of Ni&#8208;MOFs is elucidated. X&#8208;ray absorption/photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculation results indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding can facilitate the distorted coordinated structure of the Ni site with a short nickel&#8211;oxygen bond and low coordination number, and can promote the redistribution of Ni/Fe charge density to efficiently regulate the adsorption behavior of key intermediates with a near&#8208;optimal d&#8208;band center. Here the Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;(Ni&#8208;MOFs)/FeOOH with interfacial Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding shows superior catalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210&#8197;mV at 15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability with &#8776;3&#8201;% attenuation after a 12&#8197;h cycle test. This study provides a novel strategy to design high&#8208;performance Ni/Fe&#8208;based electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline media.

&lt;p&gt;Iron doping and FeOOH decorating leads to interfacial Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding in Fe-doped-(Ni-MOF)/FeOOH. This interfacial bonding can regulate the active Ni site to give the appropriate adsorption behavior of intermediates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, Fe-doped-(Ni-MOF)/FeOOH shows outstanding catalytic performance with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and high durability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of Fe dopant and interfacial FeOOH into Ni-MOFs [Fe-doped-(Ni-MOFs)/FeOOH] to construct Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding is demonstrated and the origin of remarkable electrocatalytic performance of Ni-MOFs is elucidated. X-ray absorption/photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculation results indicate that Fe-O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding can facilitate the distorted coordinated structure of the Ni site with a short nickel&#8211;oxygen bond and low coordination number, and can promote the redistribution of Ni/Fe charge density to efficiently regulate the adsorption behavior of key intermediates with a near-optimal d-band center. Here the Fe-doped-(Ni-MOFs)/FeOOH with interfacial Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bonding shows superior catalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210&#8197;mV at 15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent stability with &#8776;3&#8201;% attenuation after a 12&#8197;h cycle test. This study provides a novel strategy to design high-performance Ni/Fe-based electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silaborative Assembly of Allenamides and Alkynes: Highly Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled Access to Bi&#8208; or Trimetallic Skipped Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereo&#8208; and regiocontrolled reaction between allenamides, alkynes, and a bis&#8208;metallative reagent (Me2PhSiBpin and Et3SiBpin) is reported for the first time. This new method for accessing functionalized 1,4&#8208;dienes under phosphine&#8208;free palladium catalysis has good functional group compatibility as showcased through late&#8208;stage diversification. By virtue of computational calculations and experimental evidence, regio&#8208; and stereochemical insight was confirmed.







Abstract
A highly stereo&#8208; and regiocontrolled multicomponent approach to skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes decorated with one boryl and two silyl functionalities is described. This Pd&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economical union of allenamides, alkynes, and Me2PhSiBpin (or Et3SiBpin) proceeds without the use of phosphine ligands, instead relying on chelation through the internal amide group of the allenamide sulfonyl. A variety of alkynes, including those derived from complex bioactive molecules, can be efficiently coupled with allenamides and Me2PhSiBpin in good yields and with excellent selectivity. The synthetic potential was demonstrated through multiple valuable chemoselective transformations, establishing new disconnections for functionalized dienes. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the reaction first proceeded through borylation of the allenamide, followed by silylation of the alkyne and then reductive elimination, which convergently assemble the skipped 1,4&#8208;diene.

         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical metal&#8208;free photoredox three&#8208;component coupling of thiols with readily available alkynes and &#945;&#8208;vinylsulfide has been developed. The reaction uses the easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle EosinY/DBU photocatalytic system, resulting in a one&#8208;pot synthesis of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds. The reaction mechanism was investigated by combining mass spectrometry, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer measurements and computational modeling, revealing a unique photoredox cycle.







Abstract
The first example of an intermolecular thiol&#8211;yne&#8211;ene coupling reaction is reported for the one&#8208;pot construction of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds. Thiol&#8211;yne&#8211;ene coupling opens a new dimension in building molecular complexity to access densely functionalized products. The employment of Eosin&#8197;Y/DBU/MeOH photocatalytic system suppresses hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and associative reductant upconversion (via C&#8722;S three&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;bond formation). Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combining online ESI&#8208;UHRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling, determination of quantum yield, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer measurements and computational modeling revealed a unique photoredox cycle with four radical&#8208;involving stages. As a result, previously unavailable products of the thiol&#8211;yne&#8211;ene reaction were obtained in good yields with high selectivity. They can serve as stable precursors for synthesizing synthetically demanding activated 1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Soft Alloys Constructed with Distinct Mesoatoms via Self&#8208;Sorting Assembly of Giant Shape Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional metal alloy&#8208;originated superlattices with large volume asymmetry were successfully constructed in soft matter by blending binary giant shape amphiphiles, especially including a first experimentally observed CaCu5 phase in soft matter. Furthermore, the thermodynamic origin of these superlattices was also quantitatively analyzed by isoperimetric quotient.







Abstract
The packing structures of spherical motifs affect the properties of resultant condensed materials such as in metal alloys. Inspired by the classic metallurgy, developing complex alloy&#8208;like packing phases in soft matter (also called &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;) is promising for the next&#8208;generation superlattice engineering. Nevertheless, the formation of many alloy&#8208;like phases in single&#8208;component soft matter is usually thermodynamically unfavourable and technically challenging. Here, we utilize a novel self&#8208;sorting assembly approach to tackle this challenge in binary blends of soft matter. Two types of giant shape amphiphiles self&#8208;sort to form their discrete spherical motifs, which further simultaneously pack into alloy&#8208;like phases. Three unconventional spherical packing phases have been observed in these binary systems, including MgZn2, NaZn13, and CaCu5 phases. It's the first time that the CaCu5 phase is experimentally observed in soft matter. This work demonstrates a general approach to constructing unconventional spherical packing phases and other complex superlattices in soft matter.

         <title>Drastic Events and Gradual Change Define the Structure of an Active Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Alumina Catalyst for Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the high performance of the extensively used copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst for methanol synthesis is still unknown. How the catalyst is treated before use strongly determines its ultimate performance. Here, using combined operando X&#8208;ray methods the evolution of the industrial CZA catalysts is followed and key events that define the final structure are identified.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst is one of the most important catalysts. Nevertheless, understanding of the complex CZA structure is still limited and hampers further optimization. Critical to the production of a highly active and stable catalyst are optimal start&#8208;up procedures in hydrogen. Here, by employing operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, we follow how the industrial CZA precursor evolves into the working catalyst. Two major events in the activation drastically alter the copper&#8208; and zinc&#8208;containing components in the CZA catalyst and define the final working catalyst structure: the reduction of the starting copper(II) oxide, and the ripening and re&#8208;oxidation of zinc oxide upon the switch to catalytic conditions. These drastic events are also accompanied by other gradual, structural changes. Understanding what happens during these events is key to develop tailored start&#8208;up protocols that are aimed at maximal longevity and activity of the catalysts.

A thin covalent organic framework layer is in situ fabricated on Li (COF&#8208;Li) to suppress Li dendrite growth and mitigate side reactions on the Li anode. COF&#8208;Li exhibits a non&#8208;dendritic morphology during repeated Li plating/stripping and demonstrates a remarkable cycle life of &gt;13&#8201;200&#8197;h with an impressive low overpotential of 16&#8197;mV at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal shows great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical applications of Li&#8208;metal batteries are still challenged by the formation of Li dendrites and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on metallic Li. Herein, a thin covalent organic framework layer is in situ fabricated on Li (COF&#8208;Li) to suppress Li dendrite growth and mitigate the side reaction on the Li anode. The COF has a periodic and uniform porosity, allowing for selectively sieving Li ions and guiding a uniform Li deposition. As a result, the COF&#8208;Li exhibits a non&#8208;dendrite morphology during repeated Li plating/stripping and demonstrates a remarkable cycle life over 13&#8201;200&#8197;h with an extremely low overpotential of only 16&#8197;mV at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>GSH Depletion&#8208;Induced Activation of Dimersomes for Potentiating the Ferroptosis and Immunotherapy of &#8220;Cold&#8221; Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abundant glutathione (GSH) in &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors weakens the ferroptosis therapy and the immune response. Herein, inspired by lipids, we fabricated cinnamaldehyde dimers (CDC) into lipid&#8208;like materials to form dimersomes capable of depleting GSH and delivering therapeutics to potentiate the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of breast cancer. The dimersomes exhibited superior storage stability for over one year. After reaching the tumor, they quickly underwent breakage in the cytosol owing to the conjugation of hydrophilic GSH on CDC by Michael addition, which not only triggered the drug release and fluorescence switch &#8220;ON&#8221;, but also led to the depletion of intracellular GSH. Specifically, it significantly enhanced the ferroptosis after combination with sorafenib (SRF) and elicited a robust immune response in vivo by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and the priming of CD8+ T cells. As a result, the CDC@SRF dimersomes cured breast cancer in all the mice after four doses of administration.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The divergent total synthesis of a group of kopsane indole alkaloids was achieved. The fused ring system was installed by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, SmI2&#8208;mediated cascade reduction/aldol reaction and a late&#8208;stage cascade reductive amination/lactamization.







Abstract
We have achieved the divergent total synthesis of four kopsane alkaloids which share a complex heptacyclic caged ring system. Key transformations include an asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to assemble the central bicyclo[2.2.2]octane moiety and the quaternary stereocenter at C20, a SmI2&#8208;mediated cascade reduction/aldol reaction to construct the five&#8208;membered ring and the quaternary stereocenter at C7, and a late&#8208;stage cascade reductive amination/cyclization to establish the highly strained caged ring system.

         <title>Diversifying Nanoparticle Superstructures and Functions Enabled by Translative Templating from Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Information transfer from &#960;&#8208;conjugated perylene diimide isomers to nanoparticle assemblies is successfully achieved through synchronized supramolecular polymerization and nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly, which enables the generation of self&#8208;assembled superstructures with long&#8208;range ordering, and potentially macroscopic materials, from synthetic small molecules and nanoparticles.







Abstract
Biology exploits a transcription&#8211;translation approach to deliver structural information from DNA to the protein&#8208;building machines with high precision. Here, we show how the structural information of small synthetic molecules could be used to guide the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into diversified yet long&#8208;range ordered superstructures, enabling the information transfer across four or five orders of magnitude in length scale. We designed three perylene diimide (PDI) based isomers differing by their site&#8208;specific substitutions of the methyl group, which were able to supramolecularly polymerize into diverse structures. Importantly, coassembly of these PDI isomers with nanoparticles (NPs) could produce diverse long&#8208;range ordered nanoparticle superstructures, including one&#8208;dimensional NPs chains, double helical NPs assemblies and two&#8208;dimensional NPs superlattices. Equally important, we demonstrate that the information originated from small molecules could diversify the functions of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports co&#8208;assembly induced solid&#8208;state cofacial to herringbone stacking transformation, as validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, using very simple molecular building blocks. The stacking transformation resulted in modulation of the physical properties of the supramolecular organizations, which promotes the precise understanding of the relationship between molecular packing and properties of supramolecular assemblies.







Abstract
The physical characteristics of supramolecular assemblies composed of small building blocks are dictated by molecular packing patterns in the solid&#8208;state. Yet, the structure&#8211;property correlation is still not fully understood. Herein, we report the unexpected cofacial to herringbone stacking transformation of a small aromatic bipyridine through co&#8208;assembly with acetylated glutamic acid. The unique solid&#8208;state structural transformation results in enhanced physical properties of the supramolecular organizations. The co&#8208;assembly methodology was further expanded to obtain diverse molecular packings by different bipyridine and acetylated amino acid derivatives. This study presents a feasible co&#8208;assembly approach to achieve the solid&#8208;state stacking transformation of supramolecular organization and opens up new opportunities to further explore the relationship between molecular arrangement and properties of supramolecular assemblies by crystal engineering.

         <title>Exceptional Selectivity to Olefins in the Deoxygenation of Fatty Acids over an Intermetallic Platinum&#8211;Zinc Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report an intermetallic PtZn alloy catalyst for the highly selective production of long&#8208;chain olefins from the direct deoxygenation of fatty acids. In the reaction over conventional metal catalysts like Pt, saturated alkanes are usually obtained as the major decarboxylation product.







Abstract
Direct deoxygenation of long&#8208;chain fatty acids can produce both saturated alkanes (CnH2n+2) and unsaturated olefins (CnH2n). However, the selectivity for the production of olefins via the decarbonylation route is relatively low because of the more favorable decarboxylation pathway. We present an atomically ordered intermetallic PtZn alloy on carbon catalyst (PtZn/C) with a record&#8208;high total selectivity (97&#8201;%) for undecane (C11H24) and undecene (C11H22) in the deoxygenation of lauric acid (C12H24O2). Interestingly, the selectivity for C11H22 is as high as 67.0&#8201;% on PtZn/C, which is significantly higher than that of 27.5&#8201;% obtained on the Pt/C counterpart under the same reaction conditions. Characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the intermetallic PtZn alloy not only inhibits the decarboxylation route by increasing the energy barrier of &#8722;COO* cleavage, but also facilitates the decarbonylation route by decreasing CO desorption energy, and therefore the major product is switched from alkanes to olefins.

&lt;p&gt;Herein we report an intermetallic PtZn alloy catalyst for the highly selective production of long-chain olefins from the direct deoxygenation of fatty acids. In the reaction over conventional metal catalysts like Pt, saturated alkanes are usually obtained as the major decarboxylation product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct deoxygenation of long-chain fatty acids can produce both saturated alkanes (C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+2&lt;/sub&gt;) and unsaturated olefins (C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;). However, the selectivity for the production of olefins via the decarbonylation route is relatively low because of the more favorable decarboxylation pathway. We present an atomically ordered intermetallic PtZn alloy on carbon catalyst (PtZn/C) with a record-high total selectivity (97&#8201;%) for undecane (C&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;) and undecene (C&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;) in the deoxygenation of lauric acid (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Interestingly, the selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; is as high as 67.0&#8201;% on PtZn/C, which is significantly higher than that of 27.5&#8201;% obtained on the Pt/C counterpart under the same reaction conditions. Characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the intermetallic PtZn alloy not only inhibits the decarboxylation route by increasing the energy barrier of &#8722;COO* cleavage, but also facilitates the decarbonylation route by decreasing CO desorption energy, and therefore the major product is switched from alkanes to olefins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of a Cobalt Diketimide into an Elusive Cobalt Aryl Nitrenoid Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoII diketimide complex was synthesized via an oxidative group transfer reaction of an aryl azide with a CoI synthon supported by a sterically demanding (TrL) dipyrrin ligand. Kinetic analysis established a pre&#8208;equilibrium between the diketimide and its monomeric Co aryl nitrenoid complex that is competent for intermolecular H&#8208;atom abstraction.







Abstract
The reactivity of (TrL)Co (TrL=5&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,9&#8208;(trityl)dipyrrin) toward various aryl azides was examined to elucidate the electronic structure and reactivity of dipyrrinato cobalt aryl nitrenoid complexes. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a CoII diketimide complex [(TrL)Co(NC6F5)]2 and its reversible C&#8722;C bond cleavage to yield a monomeric Co nitrenoid complex (TrL)Co(NC6F5). Exposure of [(TrL)Co(NC6F5)]2 to an excess amount of an H&#8208;atom donor cleanly affords the CoII anilide complex (TrL)Co(NHC6F5). The half&#8208;order decay of [(TrL)Co(NC6F5)]2 via H&#8208;atom abstraction (HAA) reveals saturation kinetic behavior indicating a pre&#8208;equilibrium between [(TrL)Co(NC6F5)]2 and (TrL)Co(NC6F5) prior to HAA. Furthermore, (TrL)Co(NC6F5) undergoes reductive coupling with another equivalent of azide to furnish the four&#8208;coordinate tetrazido complex (TrL)Co(&#954;2&#8208;N4(C6F5)2), expulsion of a fluorine atom to afford (TrL)CoF, and N&#8208;group transfer reactivity to PPh3.

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Rhonin Targets RHOGDI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of the pseudo&#8208;natural product Rhonin as the first small&#8208;molecule modulator of RHO GDP dissociation inhibitor (RHOGDI) is reported. Rhonin binds to RHOGDI and interferes with its function by disrupting the interaction between RHOGDI and RHO GTPases.







Abstract
For the discovery of novel chemical matter generally endowed with bioactivity, strategies may be particularly efficient that combine previous insight about biological relevance, e.g., natural product (NP) structure, with methods that enable efficient coverage of chemical space, such as fragment&#8208;based design. We describe the de novo combination of different 5&#8208;membered NP&#8208;derived N&#8208;heteroatom fragments to structurally unprecedented &#8220;pseudo&#8208;natural products&#8221; in an efficient complexity&#8208;generating and enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis sequence. The pseudo&#8208;NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure but occupy areas of chemical space not covered by NP&#8208;derived chemotypes, and may have novel biological targets. Investigation of the pseudo&#8208;NPs in unbiased phenotypic assays and target identification led to the discovery of the first small&#8208;molecule ligand of the RHO GDP&#8208;dissociation inhibitor 1 (RHOGDI1), termed Rhonin. Rhonin inhibits the binding of the RHOGDI1 chaperone to GDP&#8208;bound RHO GTPases and alters the subcellular localization of RHO GTPases.

         <title>A Host&#8211;Guest Electron Transfer Mechanism for Magnetic and Electronic Modifications in a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reversible magnetic phase switch between antiferromagnet and paramagnet has been achieved through host&#8211;guest electron transfer via I2&#8208;vapor sorption. The partial charge delocalization was formed in the I2&#8208;loaded framework, resulting in a hundred&#8208;fold increase in electrical conductivity via hopping electronic transport.







Abstract
Host&#8211;guest electron transfer (HGET) in molecular framework systems is a critical trigger for drastic functional changes in both host framework and guest. A reversible magnetic phase transition was achieved via HGET in a layered framework, [{Ru2(2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2)4}2(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)] (1), where 2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2&#8722; and BTDA&#8208;TCNQ represent 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoate and bis[1,2,5]dithiazolotetracyanoquinodimethane, respectively. The guest&#8208;free 1 with an antiferromagnetic ground state transformed into a paramagnet, [{Ru2(2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2)4}2(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)]I3 (1&#8208;I3), by adsorbing iodine (I2). The local charge distribution of [{Ru2II,III}+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ).&#8722;&#8208;{Ru2II,II}] in 1 was reversibly modified to [{Ru2II,III}+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)0&#8208;{Ru2II,II}](I3&#8722;) in 1&#8208;I3 through HGET. Theoretical calculations of 1&#8208;I3 indicated a partial charge delocalization as [{Ru2}(1&#8722;&#948;)+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)0&#8208;{Ru2}&#948;+](I3&#8722;) with &#948;&#8776;0.2, aided by weak ferromagnetic coupling. 1&#8208;I3 exhibited a hundred&#8208;fold enhancement in electrical conductivity compared to that of 1.

         <title>Cove&#8208;Edged Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene: Molecular Conformations and Amplified Spontaneous Emission</title>

An unprecedentedly large cove&#8208;edged nanographene (NG), hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene (HBPO), was synthesized. Different ratios of contorted conformations, &#8220;waggling&#8221; and &#8220;butterfly&#8221;, were found in the crystals. The amplified spontaneous emission, which was previously only reported for zigzag&#8208;edged NGs, can be observed in this cove&#8208;edged NG, thus enriching the choices of edge structures for potential applications in laser cavities.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of an unprecedentedly large cove&#8208;edged nanographene, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene (HBPO), is reported in this work. Chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed multiple conformations in solution. Two different molecular conformations, &#8220;waggling&#8221; and &#8220;butterfly&#8221;, were found in crystals by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the selectivity of conformations could be tuned by solvents. The optoelectronic properties of HBPO were investigated by UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The contorted geometry and branched alkyl groups suppress the aggregation of HBPO in solution, leading to a high fluorescence quantum yield of 79&#8201;%. The optical&#8208;gain properties were explored through transient absorption and amplified spontaneous emission spectroscopies, which enrich the choices of edge structures for potential applications in laser cavities.

         <title>Synthesis and Screening of a DNA&#8208;Encoded Library of Non&#8208;Peptidic Macrocycles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ligands for the &#8220;undruggable proteome&#8221; is likely to require the development of new chemical matter with a greater &#8220;molecular wingspan&#8221; than traditional Lipinski&#8208;compliant small molecules. A DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) of non&#8208;peptidic thioether macrocycles has been constructed and screened for high affinity protein ligands to a model protein, SA.







Abstract
There is considerable interest in the development of libraries of non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles as a source of ligands for difficult targets. We report here the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of a DNA&#8208;encoded library of several hundred thousand thioether&#8208;linked macrocycles. The library was designed to be highly diverse with respect to backbone scaffold diversity and to minimize the number of amide N&#8722;H bonds, which compromise cell permeability. The utility of the library as a source of protein ligands is demonstrated through the isolation of compounds that bind Streptavidin, a model target, with high affinity.

         <title>Anti&#8208;cooperative Self&#8208;Assembly with Maintained Emission Regulated by Conformational and Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fine tuning of emissive properties in the self&#8208;assembled state represents a bottleneck in contemporary supramolecular research. Herein, the effective transfer of emissive behavior from the molecularly dissolved to the aggregated state mediated by the delicate balance between attractive and repulsive interactions is demonstrated, leading to an anti&#8208;cooperative size&#8208;restricted growth with weak dye&#8211;dye interactions.







Abstract
Herein, we present a strategy to enable a maintained emissive behavior in the self&#8208;assembled state by enforcing an anti&#8208;cooperative self&#8208;assembly involving weak intermolecular dye interactions. To achieve this goal, we designed a conformationally flexible monomer unit 1 with a central 1,3&#8208;substituted (diphenyl)urea hydrogen bonding synthon that is tethered to two BODIPY dyes featuring sterically bulky trialkoxybenzene substituents at the meso&#8208;position. The competition between attractive forces (H&#8208;bonding and aromatic interactions) and destabilizing effects (steric and competing conformational effects) limits the assembly, halting the supramolecular growth at the stage of small oligomers. Given the presence of weak dye&#8211;dye interactions, the emission properties of molecularly dissolved 1 are negligibly affected upon aggregation. Our findings contribute to broadening the scope of emissive supramolecular assemblies and controlled supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Sulfamide: A Promising Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal Assembled from Polar Covalent [SO2(NH2)2] Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic optical properties of [SO2(NH2)2] tetrahedra and their ordered arrangement give the optimal balance between composition, structure, and properties, in addition to a very short absorption of 160&#8197;nm. The result is several optical performance records for non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials including the strongest second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency (about 4 times that of KDP).







Abstract
For the first time, the polar covalent tetrahedron [SO2(NH2)2] is revealed as a new deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;active unit according to theoretical calculations. Furthermore, sulfamide consisting of polar [SO2(NH2)2] units was confirmed as an excellent candidate as a DUV NLO crystal. Sulfamide provides the optimal balance between composition, structure, and properties, in addition to a very short absorption of 160&#8197;nm. It achieves multiple optical performance records for non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV NLO materials, including the strongest second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency (about 4 times that of KDP), the largest birefringence (obv.: 0.07@589.3&#8197;nm) and the shortest SHG wavelength predicted as 188&#8197;nm.

         <title>A Moisture&#8208;Assisted Rechargeable Mg&#8722;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable nonaqueous Mg&#8722;CO2 batteries have been realized in a moisture&#8208;assisted CO2 atmosphere exhibiting superior cycling life (250&#8197;h) and good reversibility. Compared with the anhydrous CO2 atmosphere, the humid system improves battery performance through the formation of discharge products which have a stronger interaction with the cathode substrate. The rechargeable battery reaction can be verified as 2&#8201;Mg+3&#8201;CO2+6&#8201;H2O&#8596;2&#8201;MgCO3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O+C.







Abstract
New sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies are required to address the energy crisis and CO2 emission. Among various metal&#8211;CO2 batteries that utilize CO2 and offer high energy density, rechargeable Mg&#8722;CO2 batteries based on earth&#8208;abundant and safe magnesium (Mg) metal have been limited due to the lack of a compatible electrolyte, operation atmosphere, and unambiguous reaction process. Herein, the first rechargeable nonaqueous Mg&#8722;CO2 batteries have been proposed with moisture assistance in a CO2 atmosphere. These display more than 250&#8197;h cycle life and maintain the discharge voltage over 1&#8197;V at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Combining with the experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the reaction in the moisture&#8208;assisted Mg&#8722;CO2 battery is revealed to be 2&#8201;Mg+3&#8201;CO2+6&#8201;H2O&#8596;2&#8201;MgCO3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O+C. It is anticipated that the moisture&#8208;assisted rechargeable Mg&#8722;CO2 batteries would stimulate the development of multivalent metal&#8208;CO2 batteries and extend CO2 fixation and utilization for carbon neutrality.

Combining with the experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the reaction in the moisture-assisted Mg&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery is revealed to be 2&#8201;Mg+3&#8201;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+6&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8596;2&#8201;MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;3&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O+C. It is anticipated that the moisture-assisted rechargeable Mg&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries would stimulate the development of multivalent metal-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and extend CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and utilization for carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Redox Allylic Alkylation to Access 3,3&#1371;&#8208;Disubstituted Oxindoles Enabled by Ni/NHC Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The feasibility of chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and nickel cooperative catalysis for creating asymmetric reactions has been convincingly demonstrated. The high efficiency of this catalytic system enables asymmetric allylic alkylation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with allylic carbonates and [3+3] annulation with racemic vinyl epoxides to provide straightforward access to highly enantioenriched 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles. The great practicality of this method in organic synthesis has been showcased by facile product modification and enantioselective synthesis of the key building block to access (&#8208;)&#8208;debromoflustramine B.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for the Prenylation Reaction of Carbazole&#8208;Containing Natural Products Catalyzed by Squalene Synthase&#8208;like Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some enzymes annotated as squalene synthase catalyze the prenylation of carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone&#8208;containing substrates in bacterial secondary metabolism. Their reaction mechanisms remain unclear because of their low sequence similarity to well&#8208;characterized aromatic substrate prenyltransferases (PTs). We determined the crystal structures of the carbazole PTs and revealed that the overall structure is well superposed on those of squalene synthases. In contrast, the stacking interaction between the prenyl donor and acceptor substrates resembles those observed in aromatic substrate PTs. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that the Ile and Asp residues are essential for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor, respectively, and a deprotonation mechanism of an intermediary &#963;&#8208;complex involving a catalytic triad is proposed. Our results provide a structural basis for a new subclass of aromatic substrate PTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer and Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission (SMWLE) materials has become a highly studied topic in recent years and through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is emerging as an important concept in this field. However, the preparation of ideal TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional pillar[5]arene (  TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA  ) with a linear donor&#8208;spacer&#8208;acceptor structure and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. The bulky pillar[5]arene between the donor and acceptor induces a twisted conformation and a non&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in intramolecular TSCT. In addition, the AIE feature and pillar[5]arene cavity endow  TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA  with responsiveness to viscosity and polar guests, by which the TSCT emission is triggered. The combination of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission of  TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA  generates SMWLE. Therefore, we provide a new and versatile strategy for the construction of TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Superhydrophilic 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks as Broadband Absorbers for Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based COF (TPAD&#8208;COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV&#8208;vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD&#8208;COF serving as highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94% under 1 sun irradiation. Futher extension of the light absorption range of TPAD&#8208;based COF is realized through post&#8208;synthetic modification by chelating BF  2  moieties. Systematical control experiments and analysis confirm that the hydrophilicity of photothermal conversion materials plays a more dominant role in the current TPAD&#8208;based COFs for SSG.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor Anodes for Ultrastable and Site&#8208;Selective Upconversion Photoinduced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor junctions, using photoactive n&#8208;type Si (n&#8208;Si) as a light absorber covered by a few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick protective SiO  x  /metal (SiO  x  /M, with M = Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co&#8208;reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. We show that n&#8208;Si/SiO  x  /Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiO  x  /Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35 h for n&#8208;Si/SiO  x  /Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 218 nm.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low-energy photons into high-energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions, using photoactive n-type Si (n-Si) as a light absorber covered by a few-nanometer-thick protective SiO  x  /metal (SiO  x  /M, with M = Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co-reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri-n-propylamine. We show that n-Si/SiO  x  /Pt and n-Si/SiO  x  /Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35 h for n-Si/SiO  x  /Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti-Stokes shift of 218 nm. We also demonstrate that these surfaces can be employed for spatially localized PECL. These unprecedented performances are extremely promising for future applications of PECL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

"&#960;&#8208;Type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221; that contain a 3e&#8208;2c &#960;&#8208;bond without an underlying &#963;&#8208;bond framework, however, have been unexplored so far both theoretically and experimentally. Herein, we report the synthesis of the first stable &#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species, a silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. This compound exhibits an extremely long bridgehead Si&#8211;Si bond (3.0638(8) &#197;) and a strong near&#8208;IR absorption at 922 nm in solution which arises from a HOMO &#8594; SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8211;Si) &#8594; &#960;*(Si&#8211;Si)] transition. DFT calculations revealed a &#960;&#8208;type bonding interaction between the two bridgehead silicon atoms with an unpaired electron mainly delocalized across the corresponding &#960;*&#8208;type orbital, which introduces a novel bonding motif for constructing &#960;&#8208;electron systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Bilayer Surface Passivation for High Efficiency Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of comprehensive surface passivation and effective interface carriers transfer plays a critical role in high performance perovskite solar cells. 2D structure is an important approach for surface passivation of perovskite film, however, its large bandgap could compromise carrier transfer. Herein, we synthesize a new molecule 2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) for the construction of bilayer quasi&#8208;2D structure precisely on tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite surface. This bilayer structure can passivate perovskite surface and ensure effective carriers transfer simultaneously. As a result, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (V  OC  ) of the device is increased without sacrificing short&#8208;circuit current density (J  SC  ), giving rise to a high certified efficiency from a credible third&#8208;party certification of narrow bandgap perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, theoretical simulation indicates that the inclusion of TEASCN make bilayer structure thermodynamically more stable, which provides a strategy to tailor the number of layers of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy Enhanced Perovskite Oxide Ceramic for Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of Oxygen to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a most promising and efficient route to produce hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ), yet the lack of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts have restricted their practical application. Herein, an entropy enhancement strategy has been employed to enable the low&#8208;cost perovskite oxide to effectively catalyze the electrosynthesis of H  2  O  2  . The optimized Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)  1/6  O  3  ceramic is scalable in kilogram level and displays commendable ORR activity in the alkaline media with high selectivity over 91% across the wide potential range for H  2  O  2  including an outstanding degradation property for organic dyes through the Fenton process. The exceptional performance of this perovskite oxide is attributed to the entropy stabilization&#8208;induced polymorphic transformation assuring the robust structural stability, decreased charge mobility as well as synergistic catalyst effects which we confirm using advanced in&#8208;situ Raman, transient photovoltage with Rietveld refinement as well as finite elemental analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating Colloidal Co&#8208;Assemblies that Accelerate their Own Destruction via Chemo&#8208;Structural Feedback</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological self&#8208;assemblies self&#8208; and cross&#8208;regulate each other via chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and feedback. Although artificial transient self&#8208;assemblies have been realized via activation/deactivation CRNs, the transient structures themselves do mostly not engage in the CRN. We introduce a rational design approach for chemo&#8208;structural feedback, and present a transient colloidal co&#8208;assembly system, where the formed co&#8208;assemblies accelerate their destruction autonomously. We achieve this by immobilizing enzymes of a deactivating acid&#8208;producing enzymatic cascade on pH&#8208;switchable microgels that can form co&#8208;assemblies at high pH. Since the enzyme partners are immobilized on individual microgels, the co&#8208;assembled state brings them close enough for enhanced acid generation. The amplified deactivator production (acid) leads to an almost two&#8208;fold reduction in the lifetime of the transiently formed pH&#8208;state. Our study thus introduces versatile mechanisms for chemo&#8208;structural feedback.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate Catalyzes the Dehydrocoupling of Phenylphosphine Borane to High Molar Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High molar weight polyphosphinoboranes represent materials with auspicious properties, but their preparation requires transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Here, calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is shown to induce the dehydropolymerization of phosphine boranes to high molar mass polyphosphinoboranes (up to M  n  = 43,000 Da). Combined GPC and  31  P DOSY NMR spectroscopic analyses, quantum chemical computations, and stoichiometric reactions disclose a P&#8208;H bond activation by the cooperative action of the square&#8208;planar aluminate and the electron&#8208;rich ligand framework. This first transition metal&#8208;free catalyst for P&#8208;B dehydrocoupling overcomes the problem of residual d&#8208;block metal impurities in the resulting polymers that might interfere with the reproducibility of the electronic properties for this emerging class of inorganic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Microcapsules for On&#8208;Demand Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional implanted drug delivery systems cannot easily change their release profile in real time to respond to physiological changes. Here we present a microfluidic aqueous two&#8208;phase system to generate microcapsules that can release drugs on demand as triggered by focused ultrasound (FUS). The biphasic microcapsules are made of hydrogels with an outer phase of mixed molecular weight (MW) poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate that mitigates premature payload release and an inner phase of high MW dextran with payload that breaks down in response to FUS. Compound release from microcapsules could be triggered as desired; 0.4 &#181;g of payload was released across 16 on&#8208;demand steps over days. We detected broadband acoustic signals amidst low heating, suggesting inertial cavitation as a key mechanism for payload release. Overall, FUS&#8208;responsive microcapsules are a biocompatible and wirelessly triggerable structure for on&#8208;demand drug delivery over days to weeks.</dc:description>

Overall, FUS-responsive microcapsules are a biocompatible and wirelessly triggerable structure for on-demand drug delivery over days to weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Can we tune the physiochemical properties of free&#8208;standing organic membranes without changing the building blocks or post&#8208;synthetic modifications? The Research Article by Dinesh Shetty et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200905) demonstrates a novel pre&#8208;synthetically controlled framework growth strategy to tune the hydrophobicity of the 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane shows potential use for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture, a significant environmental and water reuse issue.

         <title>Design Strategies for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Safe, inexpensive aqueous zinc batteries are expected to play a vital role in the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, but they currently display insufficient energy density. This Review articulates the design strategies effective in boosting the capacity, voltage, or both, highlights the challenges, and finally makes suggestions for future research directions.







Abstract
In recent years, the increasing demand for high&#8208;capacity and safe energy storage has focused attention on zinc batteries featuring high voltage, high capacity, or both. Despite extensive research progress, achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc batteries remains challenging and requires the synergistic regulation of multiple factors including reaction mechanisms, electrodes, and electrolytes. In this Review, we comprehensively summarize the rational design strategies of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc batteries and critically analyze the positive effects and potential issues of these strategies in optimizing the electrochemistry, cathode materials, electrolytes, and device architecture. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc batteries are outlined to guide research towards new&#8208;generation batteries for household appliances, low&#8208;speed electric vehicles, and large&#8208;scale energy storage systems.

         <title>Highly Enhanced Aromatics Selectivity by Coupling of Chloromethane and Carbon Monoxide over H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of CH3Cl with CO over H&#8208;zeolites is an efficient reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into aromatics, which ensures the sustainable development of natural gas in an environmental pathway. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202114953), Hongchao Liu, Wenliang Zhu, Zhongmin Liu, and co&#8208;workers report that high aromatics and BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity can be achieved with complete conversion of CH3Cl over HZSM&#8208;5, following a new aromatization mechanism.

         <title>Biosensing with Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical biosensors are important tools for basic research and non&#8208;invasive diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes are versatile near&#8208;infrared fluorescent and non&#8208;bleaching materials that can be chemically functionalized to detect a broad variety of biomolecules. This Review highlights chemical design strategies and provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in this dynamic field.







Abstract
Biosensors are powerful tools for modern basic research and biomedical diagnostics. Their development requires substantial input from the chemical sciences. Sensors or probes with an optical readout, such as fluorescence, offer rapid, minimally invasive sensing of analytes with high spatial and temporal resolution. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is beneficial because of the reduced background and scattering of biological samples (tissue transparency window) in this range. In this context, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have emerged as versatile NIR fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Here, we provide an overview of advances in SWCNT&#8208;based NIR fluorescent molecular sensors. We focus on chemical design strategies for diverse analytes and summarize insights into the photophysics and molecular recognition. Furthermore, different application areas are discussed&#8212;from chemical imaging of cellular systems and diagnostics to in&#8197;vivo applications and perspectives for the future.

         <title>Insights into Dynamic Surface Bromide Sites in Bi4O5Br2 for Sustainable N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simulating photosynthesis has long been one of the ideas for realizing the conversion of solar energy into industrial chemicals. Heterogeneous N  2  photofixation  in water is a promising way for sustainable production of ammonia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the complex aqueous photocatalytic N  2  reduction is still lacking. In this study, a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of catalyst surface for N  2  reduction are revealed on ultrathin Bi  4  O  5  Br  2  (BOB) nanosheets, in which the creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle. Our rapid scan in situ FT&#8208;IR spectra verify that photocatalytic N  2  reduction proceeds through an associative alternating mechanism on BOB surface with bromine vacancies (BrV&#8208;BOB). This work provides a new strategy to combine light&#8208;dependent facilitated reaction with light&#8208;independent regeneration of catalyst for advancing sustainable ammonia production.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of Nitrate Ion Enables Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lifespan of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by heterogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO3&#8211;) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of SEI in practical LMBs. NO3&#8211; is connected to an ether&#8208;based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO3&#8211; and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non&#8208;resonant &#8211;NO3 in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiNxOy and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7% for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO3 after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives perform a specific energy of 319 Wh kg&#8722;1 and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify SEI for stabilizing LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rational Biphasic Tailoring Strategy Enabling High&#8208;Performance Layered Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxide cathodes usually exhibit high compositional diversity, thus providing controllable electrochemical performance for Na&#8208;ion batteries. These abundant components lead to complicated structural chemistry, closely affecting the stacking preference, phase transition and Na  +  kinetics. With this perspective, we explore the thermodynamically stable phase diagram of various P2/O3 composites based on a rational biphasic tailoring strategy. Then a specific P2/O3 composite is investigated and compared with its monophasic counterparts. A highly reversible structural evolution of P2/O3&#8208;P2/O3/P3&#8208;P2/P3&#8208;P2/Z/O3&#162;&#8208;Z/O3&#162; based on the  Ni  2+  /Ni  3.5+  , Fe  3+  /Fe  4+  and Mn  3.8+  /Mn  4+  redox couples upon sequential Na extraction/insertion is revealed. The reduced structural strain at the phase boundary alleviates the phase transition and decreases the lattice mismatch during cycling, endowing the biphasic electrode a large reversible capacity of 144 mAh g  &#8208;1  with the energy density approaching 514 Wh kg  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchically Nanostructured Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Flexible Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of safe and environmentally&#8208;benign solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with intrinsic hydroxide ion&#8208;conduction for flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries is highly desirable yet extremely challenging. Herein, hierarchically nanostructured CCNF&#8208;PDIL SSEs with reinforced concrete architecture are constructed by nanoconfined polymerization of dual&#8208;cation ionic liquid (PDIL, concrete) within robust three&#8208;dimensional porous cationic cellulose nanofiber matrix (CCNF, reinforcing steel), where plenty of penetrating ion&#8208;conductive channels are formed and undergo dynamic self&#8208;rearrangement under different hydrated levels. The CCNF&#8208;PDIL SSEs synchronously exhibit good flexibility, mechanical robustness, superhigh ion conductivity of 286.5 mS/cm, and decent water uptake. The resultant flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries deliver a high&#8208;power density of 135 mW/cm2, specific capacity of 775 mAh/g and ultralong cycling stability with continuous operation of 240 hours for 720 cycles, far outperforming those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solid&#8208;state batteries. The marriage of biomaterials with diversity of ionic liquids creates enormous opportunities to construct advanced SSEs for solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanoid Gd Engineers Local Electron Densities of Ni 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generally, burgeoning single&#8208;atom catalysts show high selectivities yet low current densities whereas conventional nanoparticle catalysts exhibit relatively high current densities but low selectivities in terms of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work combines the advantages of the two classes of catalysts by constructing a Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst within which Ni(I) active sites are exposed outside the carbon layers and Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the carbon layers. Lanthanoid Gd atoms can not only engineer the local electron densities of Ni 3d orbitals, thus strengthening the electronic activity, but also tailor the sizes of Ni nanoparticles, thereby minimizing the activity toward hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, this electrocatalyst yields both a high CO faradaic efficiency (97%) and a large current density (308 mA cm&#8211;2), alongside an outstanding stability (100 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally disordered RuO2 nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies for enhanced nitrate electroreduction to ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrate pollutants to ammonia has emerged as an attractive alternative for ammonia synthesis. Currently, many strategies have been developed for enhancing nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) efficiency, but the influence of degree of structural disorder is still unexplored. Here, carbon&#8208;supported RuO  2  nanosheets with adjustable crystallinity are synthesized by a facile molten salt method. The as&#8208;synthesized amorphous RuO  2  displays high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (97.46%) and selectivity (96.42%), greatly outperforming the crystalline counterparts. The disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies is revealed to modulate the  d  &#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus lowering the energy of potential&#8208;determining step (NH  2  *&#8594;NH  3  *).</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Condensation of [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8208; Metalloligand in Stepwise Assembly of Hexagonal and Rectangular Ag18 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stepwise assembly  starting from a preassembled metalloligand is a promising approach to obtain otherwise unattainable silver nanoclusters, but hard to be intrinsically identified due to the lack of convincing evidence to justify such process.  Herein, hexagonal and rectangular Ag  18  nanoclusters are constructed from [Mo  2  O  5  (PTC4A)  2  ]  6&#8208;  (H  4  PTC4A =  p  &#8208;phenyl&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene) metalloligand through stepwise assembly  .  The formation of metalloligand is confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  , then assembled with silver ions to form two geometrically different Ag  18  nanoclusters in different solvents.  The cyclization from the metalloligand to [(Mo  2  O  5  PTC4A)  6  ]  12&#8208;  can be realized without alcohols and otherwise blocked with them.  The installation of this metalloligand not only make us comprehensively understand how the solvents regulate the silver nanocluster structures, but also bring new insights for the controllable ligand metallization and subsequent condensation.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying the Key Intermediate of RNA Autohydrolysis by Cryogenic Gas&#8208;Phase Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the course of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, mRNA&#8208;based vaccines have gained tremendous importance. The development and analysis of modified RNA molecules benefit from advanced mass spectrometry and require sufficient understanding of fragmentation processes. Analogous to the degradation of RNA in solution by autohydrolysis, backbone cleavage of RNA strands was equally observed in the gas phase; however, the fragmentation mechanism remained elusive. In this work, autohydrolysis&#8208;like intermediates were generated from isolated RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase and investigated using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets. Data from both experiment and density functional theory provide evidence for the formation of a five&#8208;membered cyclic phosphate intermediate and rule out linear or six&#8208;membered structures. Furthermore, the experiments show that another prominent condensed&#8208;phase reaction of RNA nucleotides can be induced in the gas phase: the tautomerization of cytosine. Both observed reactions are therefore highly universal and intrinsic properties of the investigated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC and NHC Complex Synthesis by Chloronium Ion Abstraction from 2&#8208;Chloroazolium Salts Using Electron&#8208;Rich Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NHCs are commonly prepared by deprotonation of azolium salts using strong anionic bases. This reaction is often unselective, yielding alkali metal NHC complexes or dimerized NHCs. Alternatively free NHCs are obtained by the dechlorination of 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts using electron&#8208;rich phosphines. PPh3, PCy3 and PtBu3 are unsuitable for the Cl+ abstraction, while the sterically encumbered tris(1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino)phosphine 1 selectively removes Cl+ from 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts. Since bulky 1 does not bind to metal complexes, it was used for the preparation of NHC complexes via in&#8208;situ Cl+ abstraction from 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts. The dechlorination was employed for the site&#8208;selective monometallation with IrI, IrIII, RhI, RhIII and RuII of a bis&#8208;NHC precursor composed of a 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazolium and a 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazole group, followed by the preparation of the heterobimetallic IrIII/PdII complex [18](BF4)2 by a dechlorination/oxidative addition reaction sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Short Guanidinium&#8208;Functionalized Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s Displaying Potent Therapeutic Efficacy on Drug&#8208;Resistant Fungal Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, guanidinium&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s were designed as synthetic mimics of host defense peptides to display potent antifungal properties, owing to the enhanced penetrating efficiency into fungal cells. Short guanidinium&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s display strong therapeutic potential as a class of promising antifungal agents.







Abstract
New antifungals are urgently needed to combat invasive fungal infections, due to limited types of available antifungal drugs and frequently encountered side effects, as well as the quick emergence of drug&#8208;resistance. We previously developed amine&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POXs) as synthetic mimics of host defense peptides (HDPs) to have antibacterial properties, but with poor antifungal activity. Hereby, we report the finding of short guanidinium&#8208;pendent POXs, inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, as synthetic mimics of HDPs to display potent antifungal activity, superior mammalian cells versus fungi selectivity, and strong therapeutic efficacy in treating local and systemic fungal infections. Moreover, the unique antifungal mechanism of fungal cell membrane penetration and organelle disruption explains the insusceptibility of POXs to antifungal resistance. The easy synthesis and structural diversity of POXs imply their potential as a class of promising antifungal agents.

         <title>Enhanced Overall Water Splitting by a Zirconium&#8208;Doped TaON&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the invention of an amorphous Ta2O5&#8901;3.3&#8201;H2O nanopowder precursor together with Zr doping as the main strategies, detrimental TaIII defect species and grain boundaries were eliminated in the resultant TaON particles. These effects have improved the photocatalytic overall water splitting efficiency of TaON by an order of magnitude.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconducting materials is a simple means of achieving scalable and sustainable hydrogen production. While tantalum oxynitride (TaON) is one of the few photocatalysts capable of promoting OWS via single&#8208;step visible&#8208;light excitation, the efficiency of this process remains extremely poor. The present work employed 15&#8197;nm amorphous Ta2O5&#8901;3.3&#8201;H2O nanoparticles as a new precursor together with Zr doping and an optimized nitridation duration to synthesize a TaON&#8208;based photocatalyst with reduced particle sizes and low defect densities. Upon loading with Ru/Cr2O3/IrO2 cocatalysts, this material exhibited stoichiometric water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen, with an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the importance of inventing/selecting the appropriate synthetic precursor and of defect control for fabricating active OWS photocatalysts.

         <title>Reactivity Differences Enable ROS for Selective Ablation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compounds were developed to demonstrate that the reactive difference of ROS may induce selective ablation of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. One mainly produces O2.&#8722; which has an excellent selectivity to Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, while the other has a higher generation of 1O2 which shows no selectivity toward bacteria. This difference may pave a new way to engineer photodynamic agents for selectively ablating Gram&#8208;positive bacteria.







Abstract
An effective strategy to engineer selective photodynamic agents to surmount bacterial&#8208;infected diseases, especially Gram&#8208;positive bacteria remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed two examples of compounds for a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study where reactive differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce selective ablation of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Sulfur&#8208;replaced phenoxazinium (NBS&#8208;N) mainly generates a superoxide anion radical capable of selectively killing Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, while selenium&#8208;substituted phenoxazinium (NBSe&#8208;N) has a higher generation of singlet oxygen that can kill both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This difference was further evidenced by bacterial fluorescence imaging and morphological changes. Moreover, NBS&#8208;N can also successfully heal the Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected wounds in mice. We believe that such reactive differences may pave a general way to design selective photodynamic agents for ablating Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected diseases.

         <title>Thionolactone as a Resin Additive to Prepare (Bio)degradable 3D Objects via VAT Photopolymerization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UV&#8208;printing produces cross&#8208;linked materials that are stable and non&#8208;degradable. The introduction of a thionolactone dopant (2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT)) to acrylate&#8208;based resins produced via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization confers (bio)degradability through the thioester units in the network. The resin was used in different setups, including commercial 3D printers, and the objects were shown to degrade in basic solution under mild conditions.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing and especially VAT photopolymerization leads to cross&#8208;linked materials with high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Nevertheless, these properties are incompatible with requirements of degradability and re/upcyclability. We show here that thionolactone and in particular dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) can be used as an additive (2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) to acrylate&#8208;based resins to introduce weak bonds into the network via a radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization process. The low amount of additive makes it possible to modify the printability of the resin only slightly, keep its resolution intact, and maintain the mechanical properties of the 3D object. The resin with additive was used in UV microfabrication and two&#8208;photon stereolithography setups and commercial 3D printers. The fabricated objects were shown to degrade in basic solvent as well in a homemade compost. The rate of degradation is nonetheless dependent on the size of the object. This feature was used to prepare 3D objects with support structures that could be easily solubilized.

         <title>The Stannum&#8211;Ene Reactions of Benzyne and Cyclohexyne with Superb Chemoselectivity for Cyclohexyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stannum&#8211;ene reactions of both benzyne and cyclohexyne were realized, which is particularly suitable for cyclohexyne with a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity.







Abstract
The stannum&#8211;ene reactions of both benzyne and cyclohexyne were realized, which is particularly suitable for cyclohexyne with a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity. Our DFT calculations via distortion/interaction analysis revealed that both stannum&#8211; and hydrogen&#8211;ene reactions with cyclohexyne have later transition states due to their higher distortion energies in the transition states than those in benzyne reactions, which lead to enhanced Pauli repulsion as the decisive factor in the interaction energy accompanied with enlarged energy gap between two types of ene reactions. Therefore, excellent chemoselectivity was disclosed in the cyclohexyne&#8211;ene reaction.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Shizukaol J, Trichloranoid C and Trishizukaol A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through application of a convergent strategy, the asymmetric total synthesis of three oligomeric lindenane sesquiterpenoids has been achieved concisely in 15, 16 and 18 linear steps, respectively. Furthermore, a biological evaluation revealed that two compounds in this study exhibited unexpected toxicity against tumor cell lines, which might be of high interest for pharmaceutical research.







Abstract
The asymmetric total synthesis of three lindenane sesquiterpenoid oligomers, shizukaol J, trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A, has been accomplished concisely in 15, 16 and 18 longest linear steps, respectively. The expeditious construction of molecular architectures was facilitated by Nelson's catalytic asymmetric ketene&#8211;aldehyde cycloaddition, a sequence of allylic alkylation/reduction/acidic cyclization to forge a lactone, and a double aldol condensation cascade to construct the 5/6 bicyclic system. Diastereoselective nucleophilic substitution promoted by a phase transfer catalyst constructed the C11 quaternary stereogenic center, thus prompting synthetic efficacy toward shizukaol J. The synthesis of trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A was achieved after a cascade involving furanyl diene formation and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, as well as a one&#8208;pot sequence involving furan oxidation and global deprotection. Furthermore, our biological evaluation revealed that two compounds exhibited unexpected toxicity against tumor cell lines.

         <title>Discovery of Two Polymorphs of TiP4N8 Synthesized from Binary Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary TiIV nitridophosphate TiP4N8 has been prepared under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions and subsequent annealing in silica ampoules. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps and predict the thermochemistry of two polymorphs. The synthesis of TiP4N8 shows a promising route to new ternary nitrides with semiconducting properties.







Abstract
TiP4N8 was obtained from the binary nitrides TiN and P3N5 upon addition of NH4F as a mineralizer at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. An intricate interplay of disorder and polymorphism was elucidated by in situ temperature&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and the investigation of annealed samples. This revealed two polymorphs, which consist of dense networks of PN4 tetrahedra (degree of condensation &#954;=0.5) and either augmented triangular TiN7 prisms or triangular TiN6 prisms for &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8, respectively. The structures of TiP4N8 exhibit body&#8208;centered tetragonal (bct) framework topology. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8 (1.6&#8211;1.8&#8197;eV) and predict the thermochemistry of the polymorphs in agreement with the experiments.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Stabilized Silylzinc Pivalates for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbosilylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of salt&#8208;stabilized solid silylzinc pivalate prepared from the silyllithium reagents via transmetalation with Zn(OPiv)2 is reported. These silylzinc pivalates showed enhanced air and moisture stability and unique reactivity in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alkyl and benzylsilylation of alkenes. Kinetic experiments highlighted the crucial involvement of OPiv&#8208;coordination in improving the reactivity of silylzinc pivalates.







Abstract
We herein report the preparation of solid and salt&#8208;stabilized silylzinc pivalates from the corresponding silyllithium reagents via transmetalation with Zn(OPiv)2. These resulting organosilylzinc pivalates show enhanced air and moisture stability and unique reactivity in the silylative difunctionalization of alkenes. Thus, a practical chelation&#8208;assisted nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alkyl and benzylsilylation of alkenes has been developed, which provides an easy method to access alkyl silanes with broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. Kinetic experiments highlight that the OPiv&#8208;coordination is crucial to improve the reactivity of silylzinc pivalates. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of druglike molecules and versatile modifications of the products illustrate the synthetical utility of this protocol.

         <title>Reversible Supramolecular Polymorphism in Solution and Solid Matrix by Manipulating Sidegroup Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deterministic approach towards reversible supramolecular polymorphism is presented. By exploiting specific solvent&#8211;solute interactions, perylene bisimide molecules with a trans&#8208;azobenzene sidegroup exhibit a rich diversity of supramolecular polymorphs. The H&#8208;bonding interaction involving azo N atoms can be reversibly modulated using solution temperature and pH, which paves the way for reversible transformation between different polymorphs.







Abstract
Reversible switching between supramolecular polymorphs offers a great way to introduce stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Supramolecular polymorphism is usually achieved through pathway complexity, or by exploiting solvent&#8211;solute interactions. But, steering a self&#8208;assembly along a specific pathway to form a kinetically&#8208;stable aggregate is not easy. Also, changing solvent to switch between polymorphs is impractical. We present a perylene bisimide molecule with a trans&#8208;azobenzene sidegroup that assembles into three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct colors, morphologies, packing and aggregation mechanism. Optical absorption and FTIR spectroscopy reveal the importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between protic solvent and azo N that controls the planarity of the azobenzene group and influences molecular packing. This interaction can be further modulated using temperature, and solution pH to reversibly switch between the three polymorphs, in solution as well as in solid silica&#8208;gel matrix.

         <title>Exploring the Circular Polarization Capacity from Chiral Cellulose Nanocrystal Films for a Photo&#8208;Controlled Chiral Helix of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmitted circularly polarized light (CPL) and CPL emission were obtained from chiral cellulose nanocrystal films, and these CPL&#8208;active materials were applied for the photo&#8208;induced chiral alignment of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity of chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo&#8208;alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right&#8208;handed transmitted (T&#8208;) CPL was generated from self&#8208;assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T&#8208;CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (gabs) values of liquid&#8208;crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10&#8197;times) after T&#8208;CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with a considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo&#8208;alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical properties. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL&#8208;active materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols from Simple Aldehydes and Amines by One&#8208;Pot Sequential Enzymatic Hydroxymethylation and Asymmetric Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step enzymatic cascade reaction was developed for the synthesis of N&#8208;substituted chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from simple aldehydes and amines by coupling hydroxymethylation and reduction amination reactions. This methodology was then applied to rapidly access a key building block of various tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids of pharmaceutical importance.







Abstract
The chiral N&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol motif is found in many natural and synthetic bioactive compounds. In this study, enzymatic asymmetric reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethyl ketones with enantiocomplementary imine reductases (IREDs) enabled the synthesis of chiral N&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent ee values (91&#8211;99&#8201;%) in moderate to high yields (41&#8211;84&#8201;%). Furthermore, a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step enzymatic process involving benzaldehyde lyase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of aldehydes and subsequent asymmetric reductive amination was developed, offering an environmentally friendly and economical way to produce N&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from readily available simple aldehydes and amines. This methodology was then applied to rapidly access a key synthetic intermediate of anti&#8208;malaria and cytotoxic tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids.

         <title>Dynamic Full&#8208;Color Tuning of Organic Chromophore in a Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 2D Flexible MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart luminescent material was constructed by anchoring an organic chromophore into the 2D coordination space of a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework. Thermo&#8208;, piezo&#8208;, and solvato&#8208;fluoro&#8208;chromisms were simultaneously achieved within a single material, featuring dynamic full&#8208;color tunability, excellent reversibility, and linear sensor response.







Abstract
Developing universal stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of emitting a broad spectrum of colors is highly desirable. Herein, we deliberately grafted a conformation&#8208;adaptable organic chromophore into the established coordination space of a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In terms of the coupled structural transformations and the space confinement, the chromophore in the MOF matrix underwent well&#8208;regulated conformational changes under physical and chemical stimuli, simultaneously displaying thermo&#8208;, piezo&#8208;, and solvato&#8208;fluoro&#8208;chromism with color tunability over the visible range. Owing to the resilient nature and the reduced dimensionality of the selected coordination space, all three color modulations behaved in a sensitive and self&#8208;reversible manner, each following a linear correlation of the emission maximum with stimulus. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of the variable&#8208;temperature structures and solvent&#8208;inclusion crystals elucidated the intricate color varying mechanisms.

         <title>A Crystalline Partially Fluorinated Triazine Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A partially fluorinated, metal&#8208;free, imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional triazine covalent organic framework (TF50&#8208;COF) photocatalyst was developed. Fluorine (F)&#8208;substituted and nonsubstituted units were integrated in equimolar amounts on the edge aromatic units, where they mediated two&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. F&#8208;substitution created an abundance of Lewis acid sites, which regulated the electronic distribution of adjacent carbon atoms and provided highly active sites for O2 adsorption, and widened the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range of the catalyst, while enhancing charge separation. Varying the proportion of F maximized the interlayer interactions of TF50&#8208;COF, resulting in improved crystallinity with faster carrier transfer and robust photostability. The TF50&#8208;COF catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in O2 photoreduction into H2O2, with a high H2O2 yield rate of 1739 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 5.1% at 400 nm, exceeding the performance of previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated&#160;Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Based Complex Fluids as Aqueous Exciton Transport Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to assemble artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions is fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Here, we argue that associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. We find that complexation between an exciton&#8208;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid. We interrogate exciton transfer from the donor to the acceptor CPE within the complex fluid and find that transfer is highly efficient. We also find that excess molecular ions can tune the modulus of the inter&#8208;CPE complex fluid. Even at high ion concentrations, CPEs remain complexed with significantly delocalized electronic wavefunctions. Our work lays the rational foundation for complex, tunable aqueous light&#8208;harvesting systems via the intrinsic thermodynamics of associative phase separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Partners in Asymmetric Catalysis Copolymerization: Highly Enantioselective and Controllable at Enhanced Temperatures and Low Loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide and anhydride is a powerful strategy for preparing various isotactic polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers. However, the previous binary systems suffered from slow rates at low loadings, poor enantioselectivities and transesterification reactions at enhanced temperatures. Herein, we report novel dinuclear aluminium complexes with multiple chiralities and ammonium salts anchored on ligand frameworks. These bifunctional catalysts exhibit high activities and enantioselectivities for epoxides/anhydrides copolymerizations at harsh conditions via intramolecularly synergistic catalysis, affording polyesters with unprecedented molecular weights and narrow distributions. Notably, no transesterification reactions were observed, significantly different from the binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs. This study represents a rare example regarding temperature independent asymmetric induction for preparing chiral polymers from achiral monomers.</dc:description>

Notably, no transesterification reactions were observed, significantly different from the binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs. This study represents a rare example regarding temperature independent asymmetric induction for preparing chiral polymers from achiral monomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Symmetry Breaking of Monoacylated Anhydroerythritols and meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols through Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a chiral symmetry breaking method for monoacylated  meso  diols. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols,  meso  cyclic diols with a  cis  configuration, revealed that the O&#8208;(4&#8208;anisoyl) derivative crystallized as a racemic conglomerate of the  P  2  1  2  1  2  1  crystal system. It was confirmed that the substrate racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Evaporating the solvent gradually from the solution or Viedma ripening to promote crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals. These results provide the first successful example of asymmetric expression and amplification by deracemization of sugar derivatives without an external chemical chiral source. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to acyclic  meso  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diols. Three O&#8208;monoacylated substrates were successfully deracemized to 99% ee by Viedma ripening. We also developed asymmetric desymmetrization of  meso  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diols by combining acylation and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring a Nanochaperone to Regulate &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson&#8217;s disease and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (&#945;S&#8208;nChap) for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to regulate its assembly. The &#945;S&#8208;nChap is capable of i) specifically recognizing &#945;&#8208;synuclein; ii) dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii) tightly capturing oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv) transporting &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein assembly by &#945;S&#8208;nChap was studied  in vitro  . Moreover, the role of &#945;S&#8208;nChap preventing &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that &#945;S&#8208;nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free rechargeable sodium battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;cost and scalable sodium ion (Na&#8208;ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To compensate the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free configuration composing a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high&#8208;voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high&#8208;voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode&#8208;free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg&#8208;1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250 cycles) for 4.0 V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free cells and a substantially reduced cost in a sustainable way.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Vibrational Energy Sensors for Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational energy transfer (VET) is emerging as key mechanism for protein functions, possibly playing an important role for energy dissipation, allosteric regulations, and enzyme catalysis. A deep understanding of VET is required to elucidate its role in such processes. Ultrafast vis&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy can detect pathways of VET in proteins. However, the requirement of having a VET&#8208;donor and a VET&#8208;sensor installed simultaneously limits the possible targets; to increase their number we compare six infrared labels regarding their utility as VET&#8208;sensors. We compare these labels in terms of their FTIR&#8208;spectra and VET signature in VET&#8208;donor/VET&#8208;sensor dipeptides in different solvents. Furthermore, we incorporated four of these labels in PDZ3, to assess their capabilities in more complex systems. Our results show that different IR&#8208;labels can be used interchangeably, allowing for free choice of the right label depending on the system under investigation and the methods available.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing multivalent aptamer&#8208;receptor binding on the cell surface with programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent interactions of biomolecules play pivotal roles in physiological and pathological settings. Whereas the directionality of the interactions is crucial,&#160;the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor systems generally lack programmable approaches for orthogonal directionality. Here, we report the design of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) to direct multivalent aptamer&#8208;receptor binding on the cell interface. The positions of the aptamer motifs can be prescribed on tetrahedral DNA frameworks to realize atom&#8208;like orthogonal valence and direction, enabling the construction of multivalent molecules with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality. These directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces. We demonstrate the high&#8208;affinity tumor cell binding with a linear aptPAN oligomer (~13&#8208;fold improved compared to free aptamers), which leads to ~50% suppression of cell growth.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far&#8208;less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl&#8208;urea organocatalysts bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Kinetic isotope effect using C2&#8208;deuterium labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208; and the enantioselectivity determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous CO2 Reduction on Si Photocathodes Functionalized by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts/Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for renewable fuel production. We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO2&#8208;protected n+&#8208;p Si electrodes (Si|TiO2) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of CoII(BrqPy) (BrqPy = 4 ,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2,2:6,2:6,2&#8208;quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si|TiO2, a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density of &#8208;1.5 mA cm&#8208;2 was sustained over 2 h in neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8208;0.11 V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOFCO) of 2.7 s&#8208;1. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10 h, a remarkable turnover number (TONCO) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 20&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products Yields Inducers of LC3 Lipidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of three natural product fragments in 20&#8208;membered macrocyclic pseudo&#8208;natural products led to the discovery of inducers of a novel LC3 lipidation phenotype.







Abstract
Design and synthesis of pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) through recombination of natural product (NP) fragments in unprecedented arrangements enables the discovery of novel biologically relevant chemical matter. With a view to wider coverage of NP&#8208;inspired chemical and biological space, we describe the combination of this principle with macrocycle formation. PNP&#8208;macrocycles were synthesized efficiently in a stereoselective one&#8208;pot procedure including the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of different dipolarophiles with dimeric cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived azomethine ylides formed in situ. The 20&#8208;membered bis&#8208;cycloadducts embody 18 stereocenters and an additional fragment&#8208;sized NP&#8208;structure. After further functionalization, a collection of 163 macrocyclic PNPs was obtained. Biological investigation revealed potent inducers of the lipidation of the microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein, which plays a prominent role in various autophagy&#8208;related processes.

         <title>Shape Permanence in Diarylethene&#8208;Functionalized Liquid&#8208;Crystal Elastomers Facilitated by Thiol&#8208;Anhydride Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diarylethene is incorporated in liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomers to generate phototropic deformation upon exposure to UV light. Thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds within the network structure allow for alignment of the liquid crystalline elastomer and shape retention after initial deformation.







Abstract
Diarylethene&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomers (DAE&#8208;LCEs) containing thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds were prepared and shown to undergo reversible, reprogrammable photoinduced actuation. Upon exposure to UV light, a monodomain DAE&#8208;LCE generated 5.5&#8201;% strain. This photogenerated strain was demonstrated to be optically reversible over five cycles of alternating UV/Visible light exposure with minimal photochrome fatigue. The incorporation of thiol&#8208;anhydride dynamic bonds allowed for retention of actuated states. Further, re&#8208;programming of the nematic director was achieved by heating above the temperature for bond exchange to occur (70&#8201;&#176;C) yet below the nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) such that order was maintained between mesogens. The observed thermal stability of each of the diarylethene isomers of over 72&#8197;h allowed for decoupling of photo&#8208;induced processes and polymer network effects, showing that both polymer relaxation and back&#8208;isomerization of the diarylethene contributed to LCE relaxation over a period of 12&#8197;hours after actuation unless bond exchange occurred.

         <title>Passerini&#8211;Smiles Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketophosphonates: Platform for Phospha&#8208;Brook/Smiles Embedded Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;nitrophenols afford substrates for complex cascades tuned by further Smiles, Truce&#8211;Smiles and phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangements. DFT studies confirm the proposed reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
The Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates with nitrophenols has been used as a platform to observe complex cascades involving multiple Smiles transfers coupled with phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. When using 4&#8208;nitrophenols a rare 1,3&#8208;Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is observed leading to diarylacetamide derivatives. 2&#8208;Nitro&#8208;derivatives lead to a completely different reactivity pattern that may be explained by a nitro to nitroso conversion followed by a &#963;&#8211;&#960; metathesis. All mechanistic assumptions are confirmed by DFT calculations performed on both families of adducts. The potential of this work has been further demonstrated by the use of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides as alternative starting materials for these cascades as well as the disclosure of new aza&#8208;Nazarov access to hydroxy&#8208;indolones.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical stereoselective photoredox nickel&#8208;mediated allylation of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes is reported (89&#8211;94&#8201;% e.e.). The reaction proceeds under visible&#8208;light irradiation using the available organic dye 3DPAFIPN as photocatalyst in combination with a chiral IndaBOX nickel complex and Hantzsch's ester; that is, replacing stoichiometric metal reductants such as Zn and Mn.







Abstract
Here we report a practical, highly enantioselective photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by chiral nickel complexes with commercially available allyl acetate as the allylating agent. The methodology allows the clean stereoselective allylation of aldehydes in good to excellent yields and up to 93&#8201;% e.e. using a catalytic amount of NiCl2(glyme) in the presence of the chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived bis(oxazoline) as the chiral ligand. The photoredox system is constituted by the organic dye 3DPAFIPN and a Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial reductant. The reaction proceeds under visible&#8208;light irradiation (blue LEDs, 456&#8197;nm) at 8&#8211;12&#8201;&#176;C. Compared to other published procedures, no metal reductants (such as Zn or Mn), additives (e.g. CuI) or air&#8208;sensitive Ni(COD)2 are necessary for this reaction. Accurate DFT calculations and photophysical experiments have clarified the mechanistic picture of this stereoselective allylation reaction.

         <title>A Br&#248;nsted Acidic Gallium Hydride: Facile Interconversion of NNNN&#8208;Macrocycle Supported [GaI]+ and [GaIIIH]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of an NNNN&#8208;macrocycle chelated gallium(I) cation provides a rare dicationic gallium(III) hydride. This process is easily reversed by treatment of the Br&#248;nsted acidic (pKa=24.5) hydride with a neutral base. Similar facile redox cycling was not observed for analogous aluminium, indium, or thallium systems.







Abstract
Protonolysis of [Cp*M] (M=Ga, In, Tl) with [(Me4TACD)H][BAr4Me] (Me4TACD=N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane; [BAr4Me]&#8722;=[B{C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CH3)2}4]&#8722;) provided monovalent salts [(Me4TACD)M][BAr4Me], whereas [Cp*Al]4 yielded trivalent [(Me4TACD)AlH][BAr4Me]2. Protonation of [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me] with [Et3NH][BAr4Me] gave an unusually acidic (pKa(CH3CN)=24.5) gallium(III) hydride dication [(Me4TACD)GaH][BAr4Me]2. Deprotonation with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;ylidene) returned [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me]. These reversible processes occur with formal two&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction of gallium. DFT calculations suggest that gallium(I) protonation is facilitated by strong coordination of the tetradentate ligand, which raises the HOMO energy. High nuclear charge of [(Me4TACD)GaH]2+ facilitates hydride&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during deprotonation. Attempts to prepare a gallium(III) dihydride cation resulted in spontaneous dehydrogenation to [(Me4TACD)Ga]+.

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network with Distinctive Topology Transformations for Shape&#8208; and Molecular Architecture Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic covalent polymer network was designed to allow independent programming of the macroscopic shape and mechanical properties via two orthogonal topological transformations.







Abstract
Bond exchange in a typical dynamic covalent polymer network allows access to macroscopic shape reconfigurability, but the network architecture is not altered. An alternative possibility is that the network architecture can be designed to switch to various topological states corresponding to different material properties. Achieving both in one network can expand the material scope, but their intrinsically conflicting mechanisms make it challenging. We design a dynamic covalent network that can undergo two orthogonal topological transformations, namely transesterification on the branched chains and olefin metathesis on the mainframe. This allows independent control of the macroscopic shape and molecular architecture. With this design, we illustrate a bottlebrush network with programmable shape and spatially definable mechanical properties. Our strategy paves a way to on&#8208;demand regulation of network polymers.

         <title>Raman Fiber Photometry for Understanding Mitochondrial Superoxide Burst and Extracellular Calcium Ion Influx upon Acute Hypoxia in the Brain of Freely Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe and Raman fiber photometry were developed, for simultaneous real&#8208;time quantitation of mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal. Using our powerful tools, it was discovered that hypoxic brain injury was caused by O2.&#8722;&#8208;induced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which was regulated by ASIC1a, and the overload Ca2+ came from influx of extracellular Ca2+.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneous quantitation of multiple molecules in mitochondria across the whole brain of freely moving animals is the key bottleneck for understanding the physiological and pathological roles that mitochondria play in the brain events. Here we built a Raman fiber photometry, and created a highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe based on the triple&#8208;recognition strategies of chemical reaction, charge transfer, and characteristic fingerprint peaks, for tracking and simultaneous quantitation of mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal upon hypoxia. It was found that mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH changed from superficial to deep brain regions upon hypoxia. It was discovered that hypoxia&#8208;induced mitochondrial O2.&#8722; burst was regulated by ASIC1a, leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and acidification. Furthermore, we found the overload of mitochondrial Ca2+ was mostly attributed to the influx of extracellular Ca2+.

         <title>Ligand Engineering toward the Trade&#8208;Off between Stability and Activity in Cluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diphenylphosphonate&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag21(H2BTCA)3(O2PPh2)6]SbF6 (1) and [Ag21(C&#8801;CC6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;R2)6(O2PPh2)10]SbF6 (2), have identical icosahedral kernels but different number of free electrons. Cluster 2 exhibits much higher activity than the more stable 1 in the catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work shows that the electronic structures of metal nanoclusters can be modulated via different combinations of ligands.







Abstract
We report the structures, stability and catalysis properties of two Ag21 nanoclusters, namely [Ag21(H2BTCA)3(O2PPh2)6]SbF6 (1) and [Ag21(C&#8801;CC6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;R2)6(O2PPh2)10]SbF6 (2) (H4BTCA=p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene, R=OMe). Both Ag21 structures possess an identical icosahedral kernel that is surrounded by eight peripheral Ag atoms. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis and ESI&#8208;MS revealed that 1 is an 8&#8208;electron cluster and 2 has four free electrons. Theoretical results show that the P&#8208;symmetry orbitals are found as HOMO&#8208;1 and HOMO states in 1, and the frontier unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) show D&#8208;character, indicating 1 is a superatomic cluster with an electronically closed shell 1S21P6, while 2 has an incomplete shell configuration 1S21P2. These two Ag21 clusters show superior stability under ambient conditions, and 1 is robust even at 90&#8201;&#176;C in toluene and under oxidative conditions (30&#8201;% H2O2). Significantly, 2 exhibits much higher activity than 1 as catalyst in the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work demonstrates that ligands can influence the electronic structures of silver clusters, and further affect their stability and catalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;We report the structures, stability and catalysis properties of two Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters, namely [Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BTCA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-3,5-R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;BTCA=&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylthiacalix[4]arene, R=OMe). Both Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; structures possess an identical icosahedral kernel that is surrounded by eight peripheral Ag atoms. Single-crystal structural analysis and ESI-MS revealed that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is an 8-electron cluster and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; has four free electrons. Theoretical results show that the P-symmetry orbitals are found as HOMO-1 and HOMO states in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, and the frontier unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) show D-character, indicating &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is a superatomic cluster with an electronically closed shell 1S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1P&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, while &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; has an incomplete shell configuration 1S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These two Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; clusters show superior stability under ambient conditions, and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is robust even at 90&#8201;&#176;C in toluene and under oxidative conditions (30&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Significantly, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits much higher activity than &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; as catalyst in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol. This work demonstrates that ligands can influence the electronic structures of silver clusters, and further affect their stability and catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sensitive Logic Nanodevices with Strong Response for Weak Inputs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a &#8220;weak&#8208;inputs&#8208;strong&#8208;outputs&#8221; strategy was proposed to guide the construction of different sensitive logic nanodevices that have a strong response for weak input signals by coupling an input&#8208;induced reversible DNA computing platform with a hybridization chain reaction&#8208;based signal amplifier.







Abstract
Sensitive sensing is critical when developing new calculation systems with weak input signals (ISs). In this work, a &#8220;weak&#8208;inputs&#8208;strong&#8208;outputs&#8221; strategy was proposed to guide the construction of sensitive logic nanodevices by coupling an input&#8208;induced reversible DNA computing platform with a hybridization chain reaction&#8208;based signal amplifier. By rational design of the sequence of computing elements (CEs) so as to avoid cross&#8208;talking between ISs and signal amplifier, the newly formed logic nanodevices have good sensitivity to the weak ISs even at low concentrations of CEs, and are able to perform YES, OR, NAND, NOR, INHIBIT, INHIBIT&#8208;OR and number classifier operation, showing that the DNA calculation proceeds in dilute solution medium that greatly improves the calculation proficiency of logic nanodevices without the confinement of the lithography process in nanotechnology.

         <title>Synergy Effect of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ionic Compound: Dual Interfacial Energy Level Regulation and Passivation to Promote Voc and Stability of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic multifunctional additive (QAPyBF4) was developed and introduced into perovskite solar cells (PSCs). QAPyBF4 passivated defect states in the perovskite layer, adjusted energy level alignment at the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, and prevented the decomposition of perovskite crystals. Therefore, a planar PSC with QAPyBF4 delivered an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with a remarkable Voc of 1.2&#8197;V and operational stability.







Abstract
Defects and energy offsets at the bulk and heterojunction interfaces of perovskite are detrimental to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound (QAPyBF4), implementing simultaneous defects passivation and interface energy level alignments. The p&#8208;type conjugated cations passivated the surface trap states and optimized energy alignment at the perovskite/hole transport layer. The highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; enriched at the SnO2 interface featured desired band alignment due to the dipole moment of this interlayer. The planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSC had an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with Voc of 1.2&#8197;V. Notably, the synergy effect elevated the intrinsic endothermic decomposition temperature of the perovskite. The modified devices showed excellent long&#8208;term thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C) and operational stability at the maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h at 45&#8201;&#176;C under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination with no appreciable efficiency loss.

A cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain complex of {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;CH3OH (1; Tp=hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT=3,4&#8208;bis&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)thiophene) was synthesized by assembling asymmetric electron transfer&#8208;active {Fe2Co} units with BIT ligands. It showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet properties and a dielectric anomaly.







Abstract
Manipulation of multi&#8208;functions in molecular materials is promising for future switching and memory devices, although it is currently difficult. Herein, we assembled the asymmetric {Fe2Co} unit into a cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH (1) (Tp=hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT=3,4&#8208;bis&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)thiophene), which showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet properties and a dielectric anomaly. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural studies revealed thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;induced selective electron transfer (ET) between the Co and one of the Fe ions. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that 1 displayed on and off single&#8208;chain magnet behavior by alternating 946&#8208;nm and 532&#8208;nm light irradiation. A substantial anomaly in the dielectric constant was discovered during the electron transfer process, which is uncommon in similar ET complexes. These findings illustrate that 1 provided a new platform for multi&#8208;phase transitions and multi&#8208;switches adjusted by selective metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal ET.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Encoded Integration of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported that integrates silica&#8208;metal (Au/Ag) heterostructures by programming the density and length of protruding dsDNA strands on a DNA origami template. The binding energy differences between silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules achieve a heterogeneous integration process.







Abstract
Integrating dissimilar materials at the nanoscale is crucial for modern electronics and optoelectronics. The structural DNA nanotechnology provides a universal platform for precision assembly of materials; nevertheless, heterogeneous integration of dissimilar materials with DNA nanostructures has yet to be explored. We report a DNA origami&#8208;encoded strategy for integrating silica&#8208;metal heterostructures. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal distinctive mechanisms for the binding and aggregation of silica and metal clusters on protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) strands that are prescribed on the DNA origami template. In particular, the binding energy differences of silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules underlies the accessibilities of dissimilar material areas on DNA origami. By programming the densities and lengths of protruding dsDNA strands on DNA origami, silica and metal materials can be independently deposited at their predefined areas with a high vertical precision of 2&#8197;nm. We demonstrate the integration of silica&#8208;gold and silica&#8208;silver heterostructures with high site addressability. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy is thus applicable for integrating various types of dissimilar materials, which opens up new routes to bottom&#8208;up electronics.

Theoretical and experimental studies reveal distinctive mechanisms for the binding and aggregation of silica and metal clusters on protruding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) strands that are prescribed on the DNA origami template. In particular, the binding energy differences of silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules underlies the accessibilities of dissimilar material areas on DNA origami. By programming the densities and lengths of protruding dsDNA strands on DNA origami, silica and metal materials can be independently deposited at their predefined areas with a high vertical precision of 2&#8197;nm. We demonstrate the integration of silica-gold and silica-silver heterostructures with high site addressability. This DNA nanotechnology-based strategy is thus applicable for integrating various types of dissimilar materials, which opens up new routes to bottom-up electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescence Colour Control in Perylene&#8208;Labeled Polymer Chains Trapped by Nanotextured Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical tweezer technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased. Based on the behaviour, we can control the fluorescence colour; blue, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, and orange.







Abstract
The ability to modulate, tune, and control fluorescence colour has attracted much attention in photonics&#8208;related research fields. Thus far, it has been impossible to achieve fluorescence colour control (FCC) for material with a fixed structure, size, surrounding medium, and concentration. Here, we propose a novel approach to FCC using optical tweezers. We demonstrate an optical trapping technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) that can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased, evidenced by a fluorescence colour change from blue to orange. Using nanostructure&#8208;assisted optical tweezing, we demonstrate control of the relative intensity ratio of fluorescence of the two fluorophores, thus showing remote and reversible FCC of the polymer assembly.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8211;H Bonds via Reversible &#951;6&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange of primary, secondary, and tertiary benzylic C&#8722;H bonds by means of an &#951;6&#8208;coordination strategy is reported. The method, which features high regioselectivity and stereoretention, shows broad functional group tolerance and has been used in late&#8208;stage labeling of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
We report a convenient method for benzylic H/D exchange of a wide variety of substrates bearing primary, secondary, or tertiary C&#8722;H bonds via a reversible &#951;6&#8208;coordination strategy. A doubly cationic [CpCF3RhIII]2+ catalyst that serves as an arenophile facilitates deprotonation of inert benzylic hydrogen atoms (pKa&gt;40 in DMSO) without affecting other hydrogen atoms, such as those on aromatic rings or in &#945;&#8208;positions of carboxylate groups. Notably, the H/D exchange reactions feature high stereoretention. We demonstrated the potential utility of this method by using it for deuterium labeling of ten pharmaceuticals and their analogues.

         <title>Master of Chaos and Order: Opposite Microstructures of PCL&#8208;co&#8208;PGA&#8208;co&#8208;PLA Accessible by a Single Catalyst**

Opposite microstructures accessible by a single catalyst: An iron guanidine complex produces defined block copolymers of lactide, &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone and glycolide under solvent&#8208;free conditions at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Increasing the reaction temperature leads to enhanced transesterifications producing random&#8208;like copolymers. &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone was identified as crucial driver to obtain polymer chains with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions.







Abstract
One catalyst, two reaction set&#8208;ups, three monomers and unlimited macromolecular microstructural designs: The iron guanidine complex [FeCl2(TMG5NMe2asme)] (1) polymerizes lactide faster than the industrially used Sn(Oct)2 and shows high activity towards glycolide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone. Its distinguished features enable the synthesis of both block and random&#8208;like copolymers in the melt by a simple change of the polymerization set&#8208;up. Sequential addition of monomers yields highly ordered block copolymers including the symmetrical PLA&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PLA pentablock copolymers, while polymerizations of monomer mixtures feature enhanced transesterifications and pave the way to di&#8208; and terpolymers with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions. A robust catalyst active under industrially applicable conditions and producing copolymers with desired microstructures is a major step towards biocompatible polymers with tailor&#8208;made properties as alternatives for traditional plastics on the way towards a sustainable, circular material flow.

         <title>Modular Halogenation, &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation, and Acylation by a Remarkably Versatile Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oocydin&#8208;type complex polyketides feature a wide array of structural moieties, resembling the versatility of a Swiss army knife. These include a vinyl chloride, vicinal bis&#8208;oxygens, an O&#8208;acetylation, and other features. Here it is shown that a functionally greatly expanded polyketide synthase with numerous non&#8208;canonical features assembles these compounds entirely in a modular fashion.







Abstract
Bacterial multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large enzymatic assembly lines that synthesize many bioactive natural products of therapeutic relevance. While PKS catalysis is mostly based on fatty acid biosynthetic principles, polyketides can be further diversified by post&#8208;PKS enzymes. Here, we characterized a remarkably versatile trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS from Serratia that builds structurally complex macrolides via more than ten functionally distinct PKS modules. In the oocydin PKS, we identified a new oxygenation module that &#945;&#8208;hydroxylates polyketide intermediates, a halogenating module catalyzing backbone &#947;&#8208;chlorination, and modular O&#8208;acetylation by a thioesterase&#8208;like domain. These results from a single biosynthetic assembly line highlight the expansive biochemical repertoire of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and provide diverse modular tools for engineered biosynthesis from a close relative of E.&#8197;coli.

         <title>Surface Modification of Nano&#8208;Cu2O for Controlling CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Ethylene and Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controllable production of important carbon resources was achieved by a surface modification strategy of nano&#8208;Cu2O catalysts. Through facet controlling the highest C2H4 selectivity among Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts was achieved, while the products were completely converted to syngas with an appropriate H2:CO ratio via a MOF coating on the surface of the nano&#8208;Cu2O.

In the surroundings of carbon neutrality, nano&#8208;Cu2O is considered a promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR), whose improvements in product selectivity still require considerable efforts. Here, we present an efficient strategy for controlling the ECO2RR product by modifying the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O, i.e., by controlling the exposed facets via a reductant&#8208;controlled method to achieve the highest C2H4 selectivity (Faradic efficiency=74.1&#8201;%) for Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts in neutral electrolytes, and introducing a well&#8208;suited metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coating on the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O to obtain syngas completely with an appropriate H2:CO ratio. Detailed mechanism and key intermediate have been illustrated by DFT calculations. Our systematic strategy is expected to control the ECO2RR product, improve the selectivity, and provide a reliable method for CO2 management and the green production of important carbon resources.

         <title>Novel Quinolizine AIE System: Visualization of Molecular Motion and Elaborate Tailoring for Biological Application**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quinolizine restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV)&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) system was constructed and used to visualize both single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion. Further elaborately tailored this impressive core achieved highly efficient reactive oxygen species production as well as fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy applications.







Abstract
Molecular motions are ubiquitous in nature and they immutably play intrinsic roles in all actions. However, exploring appropriate models to decipher molecular motions is an extremely important but very challenging task for researchers. Considering aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens possess their unique merits to visualize molecular motions, it is particularly fascinating to construct new AIE systems as models to study molecular motion. Herein, a novel quinolizine (QLZ) AIE system was constructed based on the restriction intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. It was demonstrated that QLZ could act as an ideal model to visualize single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion via fluorescence change. Additionally, further elaborate tailoring of this impressive core achieved highly efficient reactive oxygen species production and realized fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy applications, which confirms the great application potential of this new AIE&#8208;active QLZ core. Therefore, this work not only provides an ideal model to visualize molecular motion but also opens a new way for the application of AIEgens.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Amides with Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An attractive deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of amides with polyfluoroarenes was successfully achieved. Aromatic amides act as readily available carbene precursors through a Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenation process, and the insertion of the carbene into the C&#8722;H bond of polyfluoroarene affords architecturally complex and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines in a single step.







Abstract
Considering the ubiquitous nature and ready synthesis of amides, and the great significance of organofluorine&#8208;containing species, the cross&#8208;coupling of amides and polyfluoroarenes, leading to new carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming methodologies, would find useful applications in synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and rapid generation of molecular diversity. Herein, we present a novel synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines via Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of aromatic amides with polyfluoroarenes through direct C&#8722;H functionalization. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, a novel plausible mechanism of the &#945;&#8208;aminocarbene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H insertion has been revealed, which may stimulate future work for the development of novel methods in amine synthesis.

         <title>Systematic Interrogation of Cellular Signaling in Live Cells Using a Membrane&#8208;Anchored DNA Multitasking Processor</title>

         <dc:description>
A cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for interrogation of cellular signaling is reported. Enhanced and controllable modulation of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of a DNA processor. The multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed monitoring signaling change directly, providing a powerful chemical tool for fundamental cell biology research and precision medical applications.







Abstract
Systematic interrogation of correlative signaling components in their native environment is of great interest for dissecting sophisticated cellular signaling. However, it remains a challenge because of the lack of versatile and effective approaches. Herein, we propose a cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for integrated analyses of cellular signal transduction. Enhanced and controllable inhibition of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of DNA processors. Moreover, the multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed the monitoring of correlative VEGF secretion induced by c&#8208;Met activity regulation directly. By exploiting versatile aptameric nucleic acids, this modular designed DNA multitasking processor dissected how cell surface receptors coordinated with related components in live cells systematically. Therefore, it provides a powerful chemical tool for both fundamental cell biology research and precision medicine applications.

         <title>Transforming Escherichia coli Proteomembranes into Artificial Chloroplasts Using Molecular Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>

Two cofactors: Like the chloroplasts of green plants, a hybrid system consisting of heterodinuclear photocatalysts and inverted E. coli vesicles generates reduced nicotinamides and adenosine triphosphate simultaneously.







Abstract
During the light&#8208;dependent reaction of photosynthesis, green plants couple photoinduced cascades of redox reactions with transmembrane proton translocations to generate reducing equivalents and chemical energy in the form of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), respectively. We mimic these basic processes by combining molecular ruthenium polypyridine&#8208;based photocatalysts and inverted vesicles derived from Escherichia coli. Upon irradiation with visible light, the interplay of photocatalytic nicotinamide reduction and enzymatic membrane&#8208;located respiration leads to the simultaneous formation of two biologically active cofactors, NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and ATP, respectively. This inorganic&#8208;biologic hybrid system thus emulates the cofactor delivering function of an active chloroplast.

The development of substrate mimetics for an asparaginyl ligase, a highly efficient transpeptidase, including a C&#8208;terminal reversed sequence mimetic of the native N&#8208;terminal substrate is reported. This retro substrate mimetic can be introduced onto recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides, enabling enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein or peptide C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligation.







Abstract
Transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed protein and peptide modifications have been widely utilized for generating conjugates of interest for biological investigation or therapeutic applications. However, all known transpeptidases are constrained to ligating in the N&#8208;to&#8208;C orientation, limiting the scope of attainable products. Here, we report that an engineered asparaginyl ligase accepts diverse incoming nucleophile substrate mimetics, particularly when a means of selectively quenching the reactivity of byproducts released from the recognition sequence is employed. In addition to directly catalyzing formation of l&#8208;/d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;amino acid junctions, we find C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;ethylenediamine (Leu&#8208;Eda) motifs to be bona fide mimetics of native N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu sequences. Appending a C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;Eda to synthetic peptides or, via an intein&#8208;splicing approach, to recombinant proteins enables direct transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligations. This work significantly expands the synthetic scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein transpeptidation reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO by In Situ Formation of a Hybrid Catalytic System Based on Molecular Iron Quaterpyridine Covalently Linked to Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent&#8208;linked C3N4&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;decorated iron quaterpyridine hybrid catalyst was initially developed by in situ Schiff base reaction, achieving high CO generation and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The enhanced catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the accelerated photoinduced electron transfer and utilization via the formed covalent linkage.







Abstract
Efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction was obtained within a hybrid system that is formed in situ via a Schiff base condensation between a molecular iron quaterpyridine complex bearing an aldehyde function and carbon nitride. Irradiation (blue LED) of an CH3CN solution containing 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), triethylamine (TEA), Feqpy&#8208;BA (qpy&#8208;BA=4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;:6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridin]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzaldehyde) and C3N4 resulted in CO evolution with a turnover number of 2554 and 95&#8201;% selectivity. This hybrid catalytic system unlocks covalent linkage of molecular catalysts with semiconductor photosensitizers via Schiff base reaction for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic reduction of CO2, opening a pathway for diverse photocatalysis.

         <title>An Efficient Rechargeable Aluminium&#8211;Amine Battery Working Under Quaternization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient rechargeable Al battery was built based on the electrochemical amine quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R3N.+ or R4N+) function as the redox&#8208;active sites to store the anionic Al complex. The constructed Al&#8211;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity, fast charge capability, and superior stability against long&#8208;term cycling and self&#8208;discharge.







Abstract
Rechargeable aluminium (Al) batteries (RABs) have long&#8208;been pursued due to the high sustainability and three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer properties of Al metal. However, limited redox chemistry is available for rechargeable Al batteries, which restricts the exploration of cathode materials. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient Al&#8211;amine battery based on a quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R3N.+ or R4N+) are formed to store the anionic Al complex. The reactive aromatic amine molecules further oligomerize during cycling, inhibiting amine dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the constructed Al&#8211;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with a superior cycling life (4000&#8197;cycles), fast charge capability and a high energy efficiency of 94.2&#8201;%. Moreover, the Al&#8211;amine battery shows excellent stability against self&#8208;discharge, far beyond conventional Al&#8211;graphite batteries. Our findings pave an avenue to advance the chemistry of RABs and thus battery performance.

         <title>Steering the Glycerol Electro&#8208;Reforming Selectivity via Cation&#8211;Intermediate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycerol oxidation selectivity can be efficiently steered via cation&#8211;intermediate interactions, resulting in highly selective glycerol electro&#8208;reforming into hydrogen and formate. This work emphasizes the significance of engineering the microenvironment at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface for efficient electrochemical processes.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of renewable biomass resources is an alternative technology for sustainable pure H2 production. Herein, we discovered an unconventional cation effect on the concurrent formate and H2 production via glycerol electro&#8208;reforming. In stark contrast to the cation effect via forming double layers in cathodic reactions, residual cations at the anode were discovered to interact with the glycerol oxidation intermediates to steer its product selectivity. Through a combination of product analysis, transient kinetics, crown ether trapping experiments, in situ IRRAS and DFT calculations, the aldehyde intermediates were discovered to be stabilized by the Li+ cations to favor the non&#8208;oxidative C&#8722;C cleavage for formate production. The maximal formate efficiency could reach 81.3&#8201;% under &#8776;60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in LiOH. This work emphasizes the significance of engineering the microenvironment at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface for efficient electrolytic processes.

         <title>Screening Heteroatom Configurations for Reversible Sloping Capacity Promises High&#8208;Power Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a heteroatom configuration screening strategy upon P/O&#8208;doping, irreversible configurations of C&#8722;O and PO3&#8722; were removed, while the configurations like C=O and PO43&#8722;/PO23&#8722; as well as the free radicals could be retained or even enhanced. The Na storage mechanisms were also studied using the resulting carbon. This work inspires the design and understanding of the &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping has been proved to effectively enhance the sloping capacity, nevertheless, the high sloping capacity almost encounters a conflict with the disappointing initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, we propose a heteroatom configuration screening strategy by introducing a secondary carbonization process for the phosphate&#8208;treated carbons to remove the irreversible heteroatom configurations but with the reversible ones and free radicals remaining, achieving a simultaneity between the high sloping capacity and ICE (&#8776;250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 80&#8201;%). The Na storage mechanism was also studied based on this &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon to reveal the reason for the absence of the plateau. This work could inspire to distinguish and filter the irreversible heteroatom configurations and facilitate the future design of practical &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.

Herein, we propose a heteroatom configuration screening strategy by introducing a secondary carbonization process for the phosphate-treated carbons to remove the irreversible heteroatom configurations but with the reversible ones and free radicals remaining, achieving a simultaneity between the high sloping capacity and ICE (&#8776;250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 80&#8201;%). The Na storage mechanism was also studied based on this &#8220;slope-dominated&#8221; carbon to reveal the reason for the absence of the plateau. This work could inspire to distinguish and filter the irreversible heteroatom configurations and facilitate the future design of practical &#8220;slope-dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high-power Na-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of an Ultra&#8208;rapid and Sensitive Lysosomal Fluorescence Lipophagy Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of brand&#8208;new large Stokes shift and highly stable fluorescent dyes were constructed. In particular, the Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh fluorescent dye as a near&#8208;infrared emission lysosomal&#8208;specific probe with ultra&#8208;low concentration and ultra&#8208;fast staining characteristics for the complete lipophagy process imaging is presented.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive dynamic tracking of lysosomes and their interactions with other organelles is important for the study of lysosomal function and related diseases. However, many fluorescent dyes developed so far to target lysosomes cannot be used to monitor these processes due to the high concentrations required for imaging, long cell penetration times, and non&#8208;ideal photostability. In this regard, we synthesized three lysosomal targeting probes with large Stokes shifts, good stability, and high brightness. The Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh dye, developed by us for the first time, can stain lysosomes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.0&#8197;nM) without affecting the physiological functions of the lysosomes. More importantly, its excellent anti&#8208;interference ability and ultrafast lysosomal staining ability (within 1.0&#8197;min) clearly monitored the entire dynamic process of lipophagy. Ultimately, this method can greatly contribute to the study of autophagy pathways. This novel fluorescence platform shows great promise for the development of biological probes for application in pathological environments.

         <title>Symmetrically Tetra&#8208;functionalized Pillar[6]arenes Prepared by Fragment Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for synthesizing partially functionalized pillar[6]arenes is reported. It emphasizes the advantages of fragment coupling over one&#8208;pot synthesis in terms of preparing highly modifiable macrocycles for supramolecular chemistry. Moreover, one of the synthesized pillar[6]arenes, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits cyan luminescence due to the through&#8208;space conjugation, which opens up new possibilities for designing luminescent macrocycles.







Abstract
Due to the highly symmetrical structures generated from one&#8208;pot syntheses, the partial functionalization of macrocycles is usually beset with low yields and onerous purifications of the target multifunctional macrocycles. To improve this situation, taking pillar[6]arenes as an example, a two&#8208;step fragment coupling method has been developed for synthesizing symmetrically tetra&#8208;functionalized pillar[6]arenes, namely X&#8208;pillar[6]arenes. This method is simple and versatile, which makes hetero&#8208;fragment coupling and pre&#8208;functionalization available. Nine new macrocycles and a pillar[6]arene&#8208;based cage have been prepared. In addition, one of the newly synthesized macrocycles, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits a strong cyan luminescence in the solid state under irradiation by 365&#8197;nm UV light. This emission originates from intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation. Meanwhile, formation of a supramolecular polymer by multiple non&#8208;covalent intra/intermolecular interactions helps rigidify the structure and make COOEtEtXP[6] an efficient solid&#8208;state emitter. It is believed that this fragment coupling can also be used to realize the multi&#8208;functionalization of other macrocycles.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Metal&#8211;Nucleobase Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8211;nucleobase frameworks were reported for the highly efficient separation of a Xe/Kr mixture with high IAST selectivity and Henry's selectivity. The selective binding of Xe arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.







Abstract
Xe/Kr separation is an industrially important but challenging process owing to their inert properties and low concentrations in the air. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation is a promising technology. Herein, two isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8211;nucleobase frameworks (HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201 and HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;202) are capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions and strike an excellent balance between capacity and selectivity. The Xe capacity of HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201a reaches 3.01&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar, while IAST selectivity and Henry's selectivity are 21.0 and 21.6, respectively. Direct breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, affording a Xe capacity of 25.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 from a Xe/Kr mixed&#8208;gas at dilute concentrations. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the selective binding arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.

         <title>HFIP Mediates a Direct C&#8722;C Coupling between Michael Acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Michael acceptors efficiently couple with Eschenmoser's salt in hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) without the need for additives or catalysts. The role of iodide and the solvent HFIP in this transformation have been studied in detail experimentally and computationally to obtain a full mechanistic picture. The products were further transformed through rearrangements and Michael additions.







Abstract
A direct C&#8722;C coupling process that merges Michael acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt is presented. Although reminiscent of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction, this process requires no Lewis base catalyst. The underlying mechanism was unveiled by a combination of kinetic, isotopic labelling experiments as well as computational investigations, which showcased the critical role of HFIP as a superior mediator for proton&#8208;transfer events as well as the decisive role of the halide counterion.

Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks self&#8208;assembled from metal&#8211;nucleobase complexes and hexafluoro anions are reported by Wei Zhou, Zongbi Bao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202117609). Amino&#8208;rich ligands provide multiple H&#8208;bonding sites to stabilize the frameworks. In the confined channels, the electron&#8208;rich anions combined with the electron&#8208;deficient purine rings generate a micro&#8208;electric field to polarize and lock Xe atoms, thus achieving highly efficient Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions.

         <dc:description>
Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene , the largest hetero[n]circulene, has been synthesized by a fold&#8208;in approach, as reported by Takayuki Tanaka and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202116789). The molecule exhibits a saddle&#8208;distorted structure in the solid state, reminiscent of a camel's back. The dynamic behavior was analyzed experimentally and theoretically, revealing a low transition state for the saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle inversion. In contrast, a planar, star&#8208;shaped conformer is energetically much higher, like a star in the sky.

Perovskites The &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound QAPyBF4 was used as a perovskite modulator in the Research Article by Juin&#8208;Jei Liou, Taiho Park, Zong&#8208;Xiang Xu, and co&#8208;workers (e202117303). Experimental investigations showed that p&#8208;type conjugated cations [QAPy]2+ adsorb on the perovskite surface with under&#8208;coordinated Pb cations and highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; anions enriched at the SnO2 interface. This spontaneous diffusion effect of cation and anion improves the band alignment at two adjacent perovskite interfaces and reduces recombination losses.

The iron guanidine catalyst shows extraordinary copolymerization activity towards lactide, glycolide, and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone, as reported by Sonja Herres&#8208;Pawlis, Moshe Kol, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202112853). Depending on the reaction temperature and the mode of monomer addition, it either forms up to pentablock copolymers in a highly defined way or promotes transesterifications to such a high degree that random copolymers are produced. Therefore, it is a rare example of a catalyst mastering both microstructures: ordered and chaotic.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Perovskite Solar Cells: A New Tool for Improving Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>

Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their poor stability in air and moisture still hinders their practical implementation. Preliminary data have shown that halogen bonding affords improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures, paving the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (HOIHPs) have recently emerged as a flourishing area of research. Their easy and low&#8208;cost production and their unique optoelectronic properties make them promising materials for many applications. In particular, HOIHPs hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their practical implementation is still hindered by their poor stability in air and moisture, which is responsible for their short lifetime. Optimizing the chemical composition of materials and exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions for interfacial and defects engineering, as well as defect passivation, are efficient routes towards enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Due to the rich halogen chemistry of HOIHPs, exploiting halogen bonding, in particular, may pave the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs. Improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures have already been preliminarily demonstrated.

         <title>Developing an Effective Glycan&#8208;Based Vaccine for Streptococcus Pyogenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infectious diseases are a human welfare threat. This Review outlines the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation of subunit vaccines developed against S.&#8197;pyogenes, highlighting the different glycotope constructs and carrier systems used as well as shedding light on some recent interventions which were developed to overcome the limitations of carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.







Abstract
Streptococcus pyogenes is a primary infective agent that causes approximately 700&#8197;million human infections each year, resulting in more than 500&#8201;000 deaths. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines are proven to be one of the most promising subunit vaccine candidates, as the bacterial glycan pattern(s) are different from mammalian cells and show increased pathogen serotype conservancy than the protein components. In this Review we highlight reverse vaccinology for use in the development of subunit vaccines against S.&#8197;pyogenes, and report reproducible methods of carbohydrate antigen production, in addition to the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation between group&#8197;A carbohydrate epitopes and alternative vaccine antigen carrier systems. We also report recent advances used to overcome hurdles in carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.

         <title>Insight into Structural Evolution, Active Sites, and Stability of Heterogeneous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution is crucial to the development of active sites for renewable energy&#8208;conversion technologies involving heterogeneous electrocatalysis. In this Minireview, fundamental concepts related to structural evolution are described. A critical overview of multiple triggers, reversibility and operando characterizations is presented, and the application of structural evolution in important electrocatalytic reactions is presented.







Abstract
Studying structure&#8211;activity correlations of electrocatalysts is essential for improving the conversion of electrical to chemical energy. Recently, increasing evidence obtained by operando characterization techniques reveal that the structural evolution of catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates brings about the formation of real active sites. Hence, it is time to summarize structural evolution related research advances and envisage future developments. In this Minireview, we first introduce the fundamental concepts associated with structural evolution (e.g., catalysts, active sites/centers and stability/lifetime) and their relevance. Then, the multiple triggers of structural evolution and advanced operando characterizations are discussed. Significantly, a brief overview of structural evolution and its reversibility in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is provided, especially for the representative electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) processes. Lastly, key challenges and opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of Recombinant Spider Silk Janus Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus fibers were created by applying two different recombinant spider silk constructs that were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement. Subsequent gold coupling via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry allowed for highly selective deposition of a conductive gold layer only on the cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein side. The study demonstrates the high potential of tailored silk design to generate multi&#8208;functional nanomaterials for various applications.







Abstract
Biotechnological production is a powerful tool to design materials with customized properties. The aim of this work was to apply designed spider silk proteins to produce Janus fibers with two different functional sides. First, functionalization was established through a cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein, ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16). After fiber spinning, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were coupled via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry. Significantly reduced electrical resistivity indicated sufficient loading density of AuNPs on such fiber surfaces. Then, Janus fibers were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement, with &#8220;non&#8208;functional&#8221; eADF4(C16) on the one and &#8220;functional&#8221; ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16) on the other side. Post&#8208;treatment was established to render silk fibers insoluble in water. Subsequent AuNP binding was highly selective on the ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16) side demonstrating the potential of such silk&#8208;based systems to realize complex bifunctional structures with spatial resolutions in the nano scale.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Three&#8208;Dimensional MXene/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for synthesizing uniform 3D MXene/MOF composites was proposed. The metal ions cross&#8208;linked with the surface termination groups of Ti3C2TX nanosheets, which destroyed the electrostatic repulsion between the nanosheets, and thereafter became the nucleation site for the in situ growth of MOF particles on Ti3C2TX nanosheets. The composites combined the advantages of MOF and MXene to enhance stability and improve conductivity.







Abstract
In this study, we propose a versatile method for synthesizing uniform three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes)/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) composites (Ti3C2TX/Cu&#8208;BTC, Ti3C2TX/Fe,Co&#8208;PBA, Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;8, and Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67) that combine the advantages of MOFs and MXenes to enhance stability and improve conductivity. Subsequently, 3D hollow Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67/CoV2O6 composites with excellent electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;transport properties derived from Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67 were synthesized. The specific capacitance of the Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67/CoV2O6 electrode was 285.5&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of the ZIF&#8208;67 and Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67 electrode. This study opens a new avenue for the design and synthesis of MXene/MOF composites and complex hollow structures with tailorable structures and compositions for various applications.

         <title>Moderated Basicity of Endohedral Amine Groups in an Octa&#8208;Cationic Self&#8208;Assembled Cage</title>

An endohedrally functionalized self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex with 12 internal amines in the cavity acts as an acid host, and shows differential basicity, moderated by the cage superstructure.







Abstract
A self&#8208;assembled FeII4L6 cage was synthesized with 12 internal amines in the cavity. The cage forms as the dodeca&#8208;ammonium salt, despite the cage carrying an overall 8+ charge at the metal centers, extracting protons from displaced water in the reaction. Despite this, the basicity of the internal amines is lower than their counterparts in free solution. The 12 amines have a sliding scale of basicity, with a &#8776;6&#8197;pKa unit difference between the first and last protons to be removed. This moderation of side&#8208;chain basicity in an active site is a hallmark of enzymatic catalysis.

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Bipolar Hosts for RGB Phosphorescent OLEDs: Boosted by a &#8220;Butterfly&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Medium&#8208;Ring Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules. A brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; heptagonal acceptor (EtBP), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, enables the assembly of high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs.







Abstract
The emitting layer based on a host&#8211;guest system plays a crucial role in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While emitters have witnessed rapid progress in structural diversity, hosts still rely heavily on traditional structures and are underdeveloped. Herein a &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules, which are not only rotatable enough to suppress close &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thus reducing exciton annihilation, but also rigid enough to prevent excessive conformational flipping, thus inhibiting non&#8208;radiative decay. Accordingly, a brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped heptagonal acceptor (EtBP), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, has been developed. With satisfactory morphological stability and well&#8208;balanced hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting properties, the EtBP&#8208;based bipolar hosts enable high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs with small efficiency roll&#8208;off, which are superior to those of acyclic benzophenone&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Directed Formation of Anisotropic Kettlebell and Tadpole Nanostructures in the Absence of a Swelling&#8208;Induced Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic kettlebell and tadpole polymer nanostructures formed through a single protrusion from spheres. This method obviates the commonly used solvent swelling&#8208;induced method to form anisotropic particles by driving tail assembly through enhanced chain mobility by tuning the glass transition temperature of the polymer core. Further, the kettlebells could be isolated and transformed to tadpoles on&#8208;demand with temperature.







Abstract
Anisotropic Janus (&#8220;snowman&#8221;) nanoparticles with a single protrusion are currently made via the solvent swelling&#8208;induced method. Here, we demonstrate without the aid of toxic solvents a generally applicable method for the formation of anisotropic polymer nanoparticles directly in water by controlling polymer mobility through tuning its glass transition temperature (Tg). Spherical structures, formed immediately after the emulsion polymerization, transformed into uniform tadpoles (with head diameter &#8776;60&#8197;nm and tail length &#8776;130&#8197;nm) through the protrusion of a single cylindrical tail when cooled to a temperature above the Tg of the polymer. Cooling the spheres to below the Tg produced kinetically trapped kettlebell structures that could be freeze&#8208;dried and rehydrated without any structural change. These unique kettlebells could transform into uniform tadpoles by heating above the Tg, representing a triggered and on&#8208;demand structural reorganization.

         <title>Organoplatinum(II) Cruciform: A Versatile Building Block to Fabricate 2D Microcrystals with Full&#8208;Color and White Phosphorescence and Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>

         <dc:description>
The controllable preparations of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorescent crystals remain a challenging task. In stark contrast to the conventional one&#8208;dimensional assemblies of square&#8208;planar platinum complexes, organoplatinum(II) complexes with a cruciform shape form two&#8208;dimensional microcrystals with full&#8208;color and white phosphorescence by unique molecular stackings, opening a new avenue for the preparations of phosphorescent micro/nanostructures for advanced photonic applications.







Abstract
Conventional square&#8208;planar platinum complexes typically form one&#8208;dimensional assemblies as a result of unidirectional metallophilic and/or &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions. Organoplatinum(II) complexes with a cruciform shape are presented herein to construct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) microcrystals with full&#8208;color and white phosphorescence. These 2D crystals show unique monocomponent &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, from either the cyclometalating or noncyclometalating ligand, and the bicomponent alternate &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking from both ligands along different facet directions. Anisotropic tri&#8208;directional waveguiding is further implemented on a single hexagonal microcrystal. These results demonstrate the great capability of the organoplatinum(II) cruciform as a general platform to fabricate 2D phosphorescent micro&#8208;/nanocrystals for advanced photonic applications.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Orotate and Pyruvate Suggestive of Common Protometabolic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic synthesis of the nucleobase orotate, and the citric acid cycle intermediate pyruvate, proceeds in a single pot from two small glycine derivatives, hydantoin and glyoxylate, under mild aqueous conditions. These findings support a co&#8208;evolution of pathways to core protometabolites and nucleic acid building blocks in a common environment. Additionally, open&#8208;chain thiohydantoin derivatives enable a synthesis of thioorotate nucleosides.







Abstract
A reaction between two prebiotically plausible building blocks, hydantoin and glyoxylate, generates both the nucleobase orotate, a precursor of biological pyrimidines, and pyruvate, a core metabolite in the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis. The reaction proceeds in water to provide significant yields of the two widely divergent chemical motifs. Additionally, the reaction of thiohydantoin and glyoxylate produces thioorotate in high yield under neutral aqueous conditions. The use of an open&#8208;chain thiohydantoin derivative also enables the potential pre&#8208;positioning of a nucleosidic bond prior to the synthesis of an orotate nucleoside. The observation that diverse building blocks of modern metabolism can be produced in a single reaction pot, from common reactants under mild conditions, supports the plausibility of orthogonal chemistries operating at the origins of chemical evolution.

&lt;p&gt;A prebiotic synthesis of the nucleobase orotate, and the citric acid cycle intermediate pyruvate, proceeds in a single pot from two small glycine derivatives, hydantoin and glyoxylate, under mild aqueous conditions. These findings support a co-evolution of pathways to core protometabolites and nucleic acid building blocks in a common environment. Additionally, open-chain thiohydantoin derivatives enable a synthesis of thioorotate nucleosides.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Oligosaccharides through Versatile C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation of Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation of glycosides is disclosed. This saccharide assembly by C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation featured excellent site&#8208; and stereoselectivity and enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse C&#8208;disaccharides and C&#8208;trisaccharides.







Abstract
C&#8208;oligosaccharides are pharmacologically relevant because they are more hydrolysis&#8208;resistant than O&#8208;oligosaccharides. Despite indisputable advances, C&#8208;oligosaccharides continue to be underdeveloped, likely due to a lack of efficient and selective strategies for the assembly of the interglycosidic C&#8722;C linkages. In contrast, we, herein, report a versatile and robust strategy for the synthesis of structurally complex C&#8208;oligosaccharides via catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations. Thus, a wealth of complex interglycosidic (2&#8594;1)&#8208; and (1&#8594;1)&#8208;C&#8208;oligosaccharides becomes readily available by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycoside glycosylation. The isolation of key palladacycle intermediates and experiments with isotopically&#8208;labeled compounds identified a trans&#8208;stereoselectivity for the C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation. The glycoside C(sp3)&#8722;H activation manifold was likewise exploited for the diversification of furanoses, pyranoses and disaccharides.

         <title>A Photoinduced Dual&#8208;Wavelength Approach for 3D Printing and Self&#8208;Healing of Thermosetting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAFT polymerization was successfully applied to visible light&#8208;induced (405&#8197;nm) 3D printing to produce high&#8208;resolution objects with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the 3D printed thermosets under UV light (365&#8197;nm) and can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The fractured materials can fully recover their initial tensile strength within 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing techniques have been widely used to produce high&#8208;resolution 3D thermosetting materials. However, the lack of repairability of these thermosets leads to the production of waste. In this study, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents are incorporated into resin formulations to allow visible light (405&#8197;nm) mediated 3D printing of materials with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the thermosets under UV light (365&#8197;nm), which enables reformation of the polymeric network. The self&#8208;healing process can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The impact of the type and concentration of RAFT agents in the polymer network on the healing efficiency is explored. Resins containing RAFT agents enable 3D printing of thermosets with self&#8208;healing properties, broadening the scope of future applications for polymeric thermosets in various fields.

         <dc:description>
A series of platinum(II)&#8208;tethered chalcogenoviologens with three&#8208;in&#8208;one functions was prepared. When bacteria were used as a natural sacrificial agent, PtL+&#8208;SeV2+ could realize not only bacteria&#8208;triggered one&#8208;component solar H2 production but also antibacterial action. This system laid the foundation for solving various real&#8208;life problems via a simple system.







Abstract
Multifunctional solar energy conversion offers a feasible strategy to solve energy, environmental and water crises. Herein, a series of platinum(II)&#8208;tethered chalcogenoviologens (PtL+&#8208;EV2+, E=S, Se, Te) is reported, which integrate the functions of photosensitizer, electron mediator and catalyst. PtL+&#8208;EV2+ (particularly for PtL+&#8208;SeV2+)&#8208;based one&#8208;component solar H2 production could be triggered not only by EDTA, but also by facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria relying on a simplified mechanism, along with efficient antibacterial activities. In addition, by using real pool water, PtL+&#8208;SeV2+ achieved multiple functions, including H2 production, antibacterial action and acid removal, which supplied a new strategy to solve various problems in real life via a single system.

         <title>Inhibition of ACE2&#8208;Spike Interaction by an ACE2 Binder Suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Entry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein could be limited in inhibiting viral entry via the RBD&#8211;ACE2 interaction due to the emerging spike mutations. Instead, targeting ACE2 with a small molecule could suppress the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into the host cells, without impairing the enzymatic activity of ACE2, which is necessary for the physiological function of the host cells.







Abstract
The emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants is a significant concern in developing effective therapeutics and vaccines in the middle of the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we have identified a novel small molecule that inhibited the interactions between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBDs and ACE2 by modulating ACE2 without impairing its enzymatic activity necessary for normal physiological functions. Furthermore, the identified compounds suppressed viral infection in cultured cells by inhibiting the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our study suggests that targeting ACE2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry into host cells and prevent the development of COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Chiral Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Circularly Polarized Ambient Phosphorescence from Bischromophoric Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending pyromellitic diimide phosphors to an enantiomeric diaminocyclohexane core results in a chiral bischromophoric phosphor that shows circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) under ambient conditions. Solution&#8208;processable PMMA films of the bischromophoric phosphors show mirror&#8208;imaged cyan CPP with a high phosphorescence quantum yield (18&#8201;% in air and 46&#8201;% under vacuum) and a significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|=4.0&#215;10&#8722;3).







Abstract
Chiral organic phosphors with circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) provide new prospects to the realm of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, owing to the long&#8208;lived triplet states and persistent emission. Although several molecular designs show efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), realization of ambient organic CPP remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a chiral bischromophoric phosphor design to realize ambient CPP emission by appending molecular phosphors to a chiral diaminocyclohexane core. Thus, solution&#8208;processable polymer films of the trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DAC) chiral cores with heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide phosphors, exhibits one of the most efficient exclusive CPP emissions with high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#8776;18&#8201;% in air and &#8776;46&#8201;% under vacuum) and significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;4.0&#215;10&#8722;3).

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Zero and Low&#8208;Valent Metal Nodes Connected by Tetratopic Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, tetratopic phosphine linkers were used to realize MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 metal nodes, which represent the first MOFs constructed using only metal&#8211;phosphine coordination bonds. In addition, a RhI coordination solid was synthesized, highlighting the versatility of these phosphine linkers. A total of six new materials are reported using unique triphenylphosphine&#8208;modulated syntheses and their luminescent properties are described.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed with M0 nodes are attractive targets due to the reactivity of these low&#8208;valent metals, but examples of these MOFs remain exceedingly rare. The rational design of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 nodes using tetratopic phosphine ligands is reported. Five new MOFs have been synthesized by systematic variation of the phosphine ligands and metal precursors employed, and these represent the first examples of MOFs constructed using phosphine&#8211;metal bonds as the sole structural component. The MOFs display solid&#8208;state luminescence, with emission maxima that are significantly red&#8208;shifted compared to Pd(PPh3)4. In addition, a RhI low&#8208;valent coordination solid based on the same linker design is reported, which displays solid&#8208;state luminescence that is not observed for the molecular analogue.

         <dc:description>
A pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene has been synthesized as the largest fully conjugated hetero[n]circulene via a fold&#8208;in oxidative fusion reaction of a cyclic pentapyrrole precursor. This circulene takes a saddle&#8208;distorted structure with bond lengths of the central ten&#8208;membered&#8208;ring in the range of 1.455&#8211;1.493&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Discrete Stacked Dimers of Aromatic Oligoamide Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking of aromatic foldamer helices in water gives rise to thermodynamically and kinetically stable discrete dimers. The association can be used to convey helix handedness from one helix to the next and be designed to form heterodimers exclusively.







Abstract
Tight binding was observed between the C&#8208;terminal cross section of aromatic oligoamide helices in aqueous solution, leading to the formation of discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimers in slow exchange on the NMR timescale with the corresponding monomers. The nature and structure of the dimers was evidenced by 2D NOESY and DOSY spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The binding interface involves a large hydrophobic aromatic surface and hydrogen bonding. Dimerization requires that helices have the same handedness and the presence of a C&#8208;terminal carboxy function. The protonation state of the carboxy group plays a crucial role, resulting in pH dependence of the association. Dimerization is also influenced by neighboring side chains and can be programmed to selectively produce heteromeric aggregates.

         <title>Light/Force&#8208;Sensitive 0D Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites: From Highly Efficient Blue Afterglow to White Phosphorescence with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) exhibit ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) sensitive to light and force, respectively. The activated PA6InCl9 shows highly efficient blue RTP with a &#934;P of 43&#8201;% and a lifetime of 1.2&#8197;s. After the introduction of Sb3+, pure white phosphorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum yield and a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) of near 90 can be achieved through the combination of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb3+.







Abstract
Herein, new types of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) with blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) were obtained from InCl3 and aniline hydrochloride. These are highly sensitive to external light and force stimuli. The RTP quantum yield of PA6InCl9 can be enhanced from 25.2&#8201;% to 42.8&#8201;% upon illumination. Under mechanical force, PA4InCl7 exhibits a phase transform to PA6InCl9, thus boosting ultralong RTP with a lifetime up to 1.2&#8197;s. Furthermore, white and orange pure RTP with a quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% can be realized when Sb3+ was introduced into PA6InCl9. The white pure phosphorescence with a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) close to 90 consists of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb3+. Thus, this work not only overcomes long&#8208;standing problems of low quantum yield and short lifetime of blue RTP, but also obtains high&#8208;efficiency white RTP. It provides a feasible method to realize near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency and has great application potential in the fields of optical devices and smart materials.

Under mechanical force, PA4InCl7 exhibits a phase transform to PA6InCl9, thus boosting ultralong RTP with a lifetime up to 1.2&#8197;s. Furthermore, white and orange pure RTP with a quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% can be realized when Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was introduced into PA6InCl9. The white pure phosphorescence with a color-rendering index (CRI) close to 90 consists of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, this work not only overcomes long-standing problems of low quantum yield and short lifetime of blue RTP, but also obtains high-efficiency white RTP. It provides a feasible method to realize near-unity quantum efficiency and has great application potential in the fields of optical devices and smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Palladium Nanoparticles for Water Purification by Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density palladium nanocatalyst is successfully immobilized on bulk electrodes via a 3D&#8208;structured amyloid fibrils template. The novel hybrid electrodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for detoxification of wastewater and drinking water.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis offers great promise for water purification but is limited by low active area and high uncontrollability of electrocatalysts. To overcome these constraints, we propose hybrid bulk electrodes by synthesizing and binding a Pd nanocatalyst (nano&#8208;Pd) to the electrodes via amyloid fibrils (AFs). The AFs template is effective for controlling the nucleation, growth, and assembly of nano&#8208;Pd on the electrode. In addition, the three&#8208;dimensional hierarchically porous nanostructure of AFs is beneficial for loading high&#8208;density nano&#8208;Pd with a large active area. The novel hybrid cathodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for the detoxification of hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), 4&#8208;chlorophenol, and trichloroacetic acid in wastewater and drinking water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of an AFs&#8208;templated nano&#8208;Pd&#8208;based hybrid electrode, which constitutes a paradigm shift in electrocatalytic water purification, and broadens the horizon of its potential engineered applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Cyclopropanation and Epoxidation via a Catalytically Formed Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric installation of a chiral auxiliary gives access to enantioenriched oxazolidines bearing a tetra&#8208;substituted olefin from readily available propargylic amines. In this work, we extend the use of the catalytically formed chiral auxiliary, previously limited to hydrogenation, to asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation using simple and robust reaction conditions for accessing highly substituted products.







Abstract
For the enantioselective diversification of a single starting material, a different chiral catalyst is usually required for each transformation. Herein, we extend the concept of catalytically formed chiral auxiliary from hydrogenation to the asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation of tetra&#8208;substituted olefins, alleviating the need for different chiral catalysts in the alkene functionalization step. The chiral auxiliary is catalytically constructed from propargylic amines in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective carboetherification step using a commercially available trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiacetal tether. The installed auxiliary is then controlling the stereochemistry of the cyclopropanation and the epoxidation using standard highly reactive reagents to give enantioenriched spirocyclic aminomethylcyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling reaction of 1,6&#8208;dienes and alkyl bromides is reported. A chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter are constructed by a single operation with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We have developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling of 1,6&#8208;dienes. The reaction provides an efficient method for constructing a chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter by a single operation. The method has excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, a broad substrate scope, as well as good tolerance of functional groups. Preliminary mechanism studies show that alkyl nickel(I) species are involved in the reaction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adjusting Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Capture of Trace Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8211;organic framework has been proposed for capturing trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu the highest Xe and Kr capacity at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, as well as a benchmark for capturing low concentration Xe and Kr. The mechanism of the self&#8208;adjusting behavior has been studied through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and computational calculations.







Abstract
The capture of the xenon and krypton from nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas is essential to the treatment of radioactive waste. Although various porous materials have been employed to capture Xe and Kr, the development of high&#8208;performance adsorbents capable of trapping Xe/Kr at very low partial pressure as in the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8208;organic framework based on multiple weak binding interactions to capture trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior of ATC&#8208;Cu and its mechanism have been visualized by the in&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and theoretical calculations. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu unprecedented uptake capacities of 2.65 and 0.52&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Xe and Kr respectively at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, as well as the record Xe capture capability from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. Our work not only provides a benchmark Xe adsorbent but proposes a new route to construct smart materials for efficient separations.

         <title>Direct and Catalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Arenes: Expeditious Synthesis of the Remdesivir Nucleoside**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars is presented. A silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which are cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The utility of the method is showcased in the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 by a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.







Abstract
Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air&#8208;sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, thus impeding a cost&#8208;efficient supply to patients. We have, therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation that initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 after a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.

A silylium-catalyzed and completely stereoselective &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation initially yields the open-chain polyols, which are cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;-furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;-anomer. The utility of the method is showcased in the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS-441524 by a subsequent Mn-catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS-CoV-2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air-sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, thus impeding a cost-efficient supply to patients. We have, therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium-catalyzed and completely stereoselective C-glycosylation that initially yields the open-chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;-furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;-anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS-441524 after a subsequent Mn-catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
