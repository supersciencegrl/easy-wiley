         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Chemistry in Aqueous Ammonium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.

Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self-adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate-opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes of HPN&#8226; and HNP&#8226; Radicals with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus mononitride (PN) is a carrier of phosphorus in the interstellar medium. As the simplest derivatives of PN, the radical species HPN&#8226; and HNP&#8226; have remained elusive. Herein, we report the generation, characterization, and photochemistry of HPN&#8226; and HNP&#8226; in N2&#8208;matrix at 3 K. Specifically, HPN&#8226; was formed as a weakly bonded complex with CO in the matrix by 254 nm photolysis of the novel phosphinyl radical HPNCO&#8226;. The &#8226;NPH&#8722;CO complex is extremely unstable, as it undergoes spontaneous isomerization to the lower&#8208;energy isomer &#8226;PNH&#8722;CO through fast quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) with a half&#8208;life of 6.1 min at 3 K. Upon further irradiation at 254 nm, the reverse conversion of &#8226;PNH&#8722;CO to &#8226;NPH&#8722;CO along with dehydrogenation to yield PN was observed. The characterization &#8226;NPH&#8722;CO and &#8226;PNH&#8722;CO with matrix&#8208;isolation IR spectroscopy is supported by D, 15N, and 13C isotope labeling and quantum chemical calculations at the XYGJ&#8208;OS/AVTZ level of theory, and the mechanism by hydrogen atom tunneling is consistent with multidimensional instanton theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytically Active Site Mapping Realized through Energy Transfer Modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demands of a sustainable chemical industry are a driving force for the development of heterogeneous catalytic platforms exhibiting facile catalyst recovery, recycling, and resilience to diverse reaction conditions. Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst transitions can be realized through the integration of efficient homogeneous catalysts within porous matrices. Herein, we offer a versatile approach to understanding how guest distribution and evolution impact the catalytic performance of heterogeneous host&#8208;guest catalytic platforms by implementing the resonance energy transfer (RET) concept using fluorescent model systems mimicking the steric constraints of targeted catalysts. Using the RET&#8208;based methodology, we mapped condition&#8208;dependent guest (re)distribution within a porous support on the example of modular matrices such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Furthermore, we correlate RET results performed on the model systems with the catalytic performance of two MOF&#8208;encapsulated catalysts used to promote CO2 hydrogenation and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Guests are incorporated using aperture&#8208;opening encapsulation, and catalyst redistribution is not observed under practical reaction conditions, showcasing a pathway to advance catalyst recyclability in the case of host&#8208;guest platforms. These studies represent the first generalizable approach for mapping the guest distribution in heterogeneous host&#8208;guest catalytic systems, providing a foundation for predicting and tailoring the performance of catalysts integrated into various porous supports.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Conjugated Nickel(II)&#8208;Acetylide Framework for Efficient Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of transition&#8208;metal single atoms as molecular functional entities into the skeleton of graphdiyne (GDY) to construct novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;acetylide frameworks, known as metalated graphynes (MGYs), is a promising strategy for developing efficient catalysts, which can combine the tunable charge transfer of GDY frameworks, the catalytic activity of metal and the precise distribution of single metallic centers. Herein, four highly conjugated MGY photocatalysts based on NiII, PdII, PtII, and HgII were synthesized for the first time using the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; strategy through the use of M&#8211;C bonds (&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;M&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;). Remarkably, the NiII&#8208;based graphyne (TEPY&#8208;Ni&#8208;GY) exhibited the highest CO generation rate of 18.3 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a selectivity of 98.8%. This superior performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of pyrenyl and &#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;Ni(PBu3)2&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211; moieties. The pyrenyl block functions as an intramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugation channel, facilitating kinetically favorable electron transfer, while the &#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;Ni(PBu3)2&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211; moiety serves as the catalytic site that enhances CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution. This study provides a new perspective on MGY&#8208;based photocatalysts for developing highly active and low&#8208;cost catalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of mechanophores, polymer mechanochemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for creating force&#8208;responsive materials with a variety of desired functions, ranging from color change to molecular release. However, it remains challenging to improve the efficiency of mechanochemical activation, especially for mechanophores embedded within polymer networks, which has profound implications for translating mechanochemical responses into materials&#8208;centered applications. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation. In this Minireview, we discuss and summarize recent progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces including surfaces/interfaces, polymer assemblies, and other nanostructures, specifically focusing on the effects of spatial confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation. We envision that combining confinement effects with advances in molecular and materials engineering will further improve the activation efficiency, capitalizing more fully on the potential of mechanophores toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Germylene Mediated Reductive C&#8211;C and C&#8210;N Coupling of an Isocyanide and its Device Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have demonstrated a unique reductive coupling of 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide, facilitated by a perimidine&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene (NHGe), which yields a bis&#8208;spirogerma compound featuring simultaneous C&#8210;C and C&#8210;N bond formation. This reaction, which leads to the oxidation of germanium from +2 to +4, represents a significant departure from previously documented isocyanide&#8208;germylene interactions. The product exhibits extensive conjugation across its bicyclic C&#8324;Ge&#8322;N&#8322; framework, conferring distinct photophysical properties, including prominent orange luminescence in both solution and solid states. The photophysical properties are supported by the TD&#8208;DFT calculations confirming an n&#8594;&#960;* transition. The potential application of this compound in optoelectronic devices, particularly as a hole transport layer in PbS quantum dot solar cells, is also explored, with promising preliminary results.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Dynamics Switches the Selectivity of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Reverse Water Gas&#8208;Shift reaction (CO2 + H2=CO + H2O) allows to balance syn&#8208;gas under industrial conditions. Nickel has been suggested as a potential catalyst but the temperature required is too high, more than 800&#186;C, limiting practical implementation but when lowering the temperature methanation occurs. Simulations via Density Functional Theory on well&#8208;defined surfaces have systematically failed to reproduce these experimental results. But under reaction conditions Ni surfaces are not static and DFT models coupled to microkinetics show that at high CO coverages drive the generation of Ni adatoms that are the active sites for methanation. At higher temperatures, the adatom population decreases, and the selectivity towards CO increases. Thus, the mechanism behind the selectivity switch is driven by the dynamics induced by reaction intermediates. Our work contributes to the inclusion of dynamic aspects of materials under reaction conditions in the understanding of complex catalytic behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Endo&#8208;Encapsulated Multi&#8208;Resonance Dendrimers with Through&#8208;Space Interactions for Efficient Narrowband Blue&#8208;Emitting Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from conventional luminescent dendrimers with fluorophore tethered outside to dendron, here we first developed endo&#8208;encapsulated luminescent dendrimers with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fluorophore embedded inside of carbazole dendrons by growing dendrons through 1,8&#8208;positions of central carbazole moiety to create a cavity for accommodating the fluorophore. This endo&#8208;encapsulated structure not only shields the fluorophore to fully resist aggregation&#8208;caused spectral broadening, but also induce through&#8208;space interactions between dendron and fluorophore via intramolecular &#960;&#8208;stacking, giving lowered singlet state energy and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet states. The resultant dendrimer containing 1,8&#8208;linked second&#8208;generation carbazole dendrons and boron, sulfur&#8208;doped polycyclic MR fluorophore exhibits narrowband blue emission at 471 nm with FWHM kept at 34 nm even in neat film, together with ~4 times enhancement of RISC rate constant compared to its exo&#8208;tethered counterpart. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on the endo&#8208;encapsulated dendrimer reveal efficient narrowband blue emissions with maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.6%, representing the best device efficiency for blue&#8208;emitting multi&#8208;resonance dendrimers so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in Photoelectrochemical Alcohol Oxidation Enhanced by Nickel&#8208;based Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using biomass oxidation reactions instead of water oxidation reactions is optimal for accomplishing biomass conversion and effective hydrogen generation. Here, we report that Fe2O3 photoanodes with a NiOOH cocatalyst exhibit excellent performance for photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The conversion efficiency for HMF reaches 98.5%, while the selectivity for FDCA is 94.2%. We revealed that HMF is oxidized through a spontaneous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process with the high&#8208;valent phase of the Ni&#8208;based catalyst. The dangling oxygen and bridging oxygen of the high&#8208;valent phase species serve as proton&#8208;accepting sites. Furthermore, we pointed out that the deprotonated bond dissociation free energy difference between the catalysts and alcohols is the thermodynamic trigger for the PCET process. This study provides a reasonable explanation for the alcohol oxidation reaction, which is beneficial for designing biomass conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Promotion of RNF168&#8208;Mediated Nucleosomal H2A Ubiquitylation by Structurally defined K63&#8208;Polyubiquitylated Linker Histone H1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of histones with homogeneous modifications is a potent approach for quantitatively deciphering the functional crosstalk between different post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). Here, we developed an expedient site&#8208;specific (poly)ubiquitylation strategy (CAEPL, Cysteine&#8208;Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation), which integrates the Cys&#8208;aminoethylation reaction with the process of ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzyme UBA1&#8208;assisted native chemical ligation. Using this strategy, we successfully prepared monoubiquitylated and K63&#8208;linked di&#8208; and tri&#8208;ubiquitylated linker histone H1.0 proteins, which were incorporated into individual chromatosomes. Quantitative biochemical analysis of different RNF168 constructs on ubiquitylated chromatosomes with different ubiquitin chain lengths demonstrated that K63&#8208;linked polyubiquitylated H1.0 could directly stimulate RNF168 ubiquitylation activity by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and chromatosome. Subsequent cryo&#8208;EM structural analysis of the RNF168/UbcH5c&#8211;Ub/H1.0&#8211;K63&#8208;Ub3 chromatosome complex revealed the potential recruitment orientation between RNF168 UDM1 domain and K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chain on H1.0. Finally, we explored the impact of H1.0 ubiquitylation on RNF168 activity in the context of asymmetric H1.0&#8211;K63&#8208;Ub3 di&#8208;nucleosome substrate, revealing a comparable stimulation effect of both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;nucleosomal crosstalk. Overall, our study highlights the significance of access to structurally&#8208;defined polyubiquitylated H1.0 by CAEPL strategy, enabling in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations of in&#8208;trans PTM crosstalk between linker histone H1.0 and core histone H2A ubiquitylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Nanobelts for Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) amorphous nanomaterials combine the advantages of high active site concentration of amorphous structure, high specific surface area and efficient charge transfer and mass transport of 1D materials, so they present promising opportunities for catalysis. However, a significant challenge involves achieving a balance between the high orientation of 1D morphology and the isotropy of amorphous structure, which severely obstructs the controllable preparation of 1D amorphous materials. Guided by the hard&#8208;soft acids&#8208;bases theory, here we develop a general strategy for preparing 1D amorphous nanomaterials through the precise modulation of bond strength between metal ions and organic ligands for a moderated fastness. The soft base dodecanethiol (DT) is multifunctionally served as both structure&#8208;regulating agent and morphology&#8208;directing agent. Compared with the borderline acids (e.g. Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+) to construct amorphous structure, soft acid of Cu+ which produced crystalline nanobelts can still be amorphized by reducing the hardness of Cu ions through redox reaction to weak Cu&#8208;SR bond. Due to the combined advantages of amorphous structure and one&#8208;dimensional morphology, amorphous CuDT nanobelts exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical nitrate reduction, outperformed the most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This work will effectively bridge the gap between traditional 1D crystalline nanomaterials and amorphization preparation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels is green and sustainable, but severely restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Constructing intriguing photocatalysts with effective active centers is a shortcut to breaking the kinetic bottleneck with great significance. Herein, we synthesize two novel neutral phenanthridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2) for photosynthesizing H2O2. Compared to the no phenanthridine counterpart (AN&#8208;COF), the H2O2 photosynthetic activities of PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2 are markedly boosted. In air and pure water without sacrificial agents, under Xe lamp and natural sunlight, the H2O2 photogeneration rate of PD&#8208;COF2 is 6103 and 3646 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively. Further experimental and theoretical inspections demonstrate that introducing phenanthridine units into COFs smoothly modulates the charge carrier dynamics and thermodynamically favors the generation of crucial OOH* and OH* intermediates in the ORR and WOR paths, respectively. Additionally, this is the first time the neutral phenanthridine moiety serves as the photooxidation unit for 2e&#8208; WOR towards H2O2 photoproduction. The current work sheds light on exploring novel catalytic centers for high&#8208;performance H2O2 evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Diatomic Active Sites for Elucidating Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance Trends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diatomic catalysts, especially those with heteronuclear active sites, have recently attracted significant attention for their advantages over single&#8208;atom catalysts in reactions with relatively high energy barrier, e.g. oxygen evolution reaction. Rational design and synthesis of heteronuclear diatomic catalysts are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report macrocyclic precursor constrained strategy to fabricate series of transition metal (MT, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, or Cu)&#8208;noble (MN, Ir or Ru) centers in carbon material. One notable&#160;performance trend is observed in the order of Cu&#8208;MN &lt; Mn&#8208;MN &lt; Fe&#8208;MN &lt; MN &lt; Co&#8208;MN &lt; Ni&#8208;MN. However, the&#160;pathway has been not altered, still following the traditional adsorption reaction mechanism. The effect of the MT atoms on the&#160;performances could possibly originate from the distinct adsorption/desorption behaviors of key intermediates (i.e. *OH, *O and/or *OOH), strongly implying that &#916;G*OOH&#8208;&#916;G*OH could be used as the performance descriptor. We believe that our work provides useful strategy for synthesis of diatomic active sites with sole coordination configuration and varied composition, and in&#8208;depth insight to their catalytic mechanism, which could be used for further optimization of diatomic catalysts towards oxygen electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicon in Si3Cu3&#8722; Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations have identified the global minimum structure of the 16&#8208;valence electron Si3Cu3&#8208; cluster, which features a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) in a rhombic arrangement. The Si3 and Cu3 triangles are interconnected by an Si2/Cu2 edge, forming an ordered chain&#8208;like structure. Besides the conventional 2c&#8208;2e &#963;&#8208;bond connecting Si3 and Cu3, the stability of this cluster is reinforced by a delocalized 3c&#8208;2e &#963;&#8208;bond in Cu3 and a &#960;&#8208;bond in Si3. Our study provides rare experimental confirmation of a planar hypercoordinate heavier Group 14 element, opening possibilities for exploring similar structures in two&#8208;dimensional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethanol processable inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid hole transporting layers enabled 20.12% efficiency organic solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a high&#8208;performance inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid hole transporting layer (HTL) was developed using ethanol&#8208;soluble alkoxide precursors and a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM). Three metal oxides&#8212;vanadium oxide (VOx), niobium oxide (Nb2O5), and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5)&#8212;were synthesized through successive low&#8208;temperature (100 &#176;C) thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments of their respective precursors: vanadium oxytriethoxide (EtO&#8208;V), niobium ethoxide (EtO&#8208;Nb), and tantalum ethoxide (EtO&#8208;Ta). Among these, the Nb2O5 film exhibited excellent transmittance, a high work function, and good conductivity, along with a more compact and uniform structure featuring fewer interfacial defects, which facilitated efficient charge extraction and transport. Furthermore, the deposition of a SAM of (2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (2PACz) on top of Nb2O5 further passivated defects, enhancing interfacial contact with the photoactive layer. The resulting inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid HTL of Nb2O5/2PACz demonstrated excellent compatibility with various photoactive blends, achieving impressive power conversion efficiencies of 19.44%, 19.18%, and 20.12% for the PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, and D18:BTP&#8208;eC9 based organic solar cells, respectively. 20.12% is the best performance for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells with binary components as the photoactive layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Non&#8208;Equilibrium Solvation Structure&#160;in&#160;Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) encounters significant challenges due to aggressive electrode chemistry. Recently, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) have garnered attention for their exceptional stability with both Li anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes.&#160;However, there remains a limited understanding of how diluents in LCILEs affect the thermodynamic stability of the solvation structure and transportation dynamics of Li+ ions. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature LCILEs with 1,3&#8208;dichloropropane (DCP13) diluent to construct a non&#8208;equilibrium solvation structure under external&#160;electric field, wherein the DCP13 diluent enters the Li+ ion solvation sheath to enhance Li+ ion transport and suppress oxidative side reactions at high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, NCM90).Consequently, a Li/NCM90 cell utilizing this LCILE achieves a high capacity retention of 94% after 240 cycles at 4.3 V, also operates stably at high cut&#8208;off voltages from 4.4 to 4.6 V and over a wide temperature range from &#8208;20 to 60 &#176;C. Additionally, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with this LCILE simultaneously achieves high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and stable cycling, manifesting the practical feasibility. This work redefines the role of diluents in LCILEs, providing inspiration for electrolyte design in developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes with Emission up to 1010 nm: Synthesis, Structures, and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized absorbing or emitting materials offer distinct advantages over their visible&#8208;light counterparts and have attracted considerable interest across various fields. Materials exhibiting NIR chiroptical properties with high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are particularly rare. In this study, we report the synthesis of a series of helical nanographenes (1, 2, 3, and 4), where perylene is fused with one to four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (sub)units via a strategy involving Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition followed by Scholl reaction. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed their structures, revealing helicene moieties integrated into a highly contorted framework. Benefiting from a similar distribution pattern of frontier molecular orbitals to perylene and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, compounds 1&#8208;4 demonstrate respectable &#934;F values of 31.9%, 15.0%, 13.7%, and 6.5%, respectively, with emission maxima reaching up to 1010 nm. Their enantiopure forms, isolated by preparative chiral HPLC, exhibit distinct circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence across a broad spectral range, extending from the ultraviolet to the NIR.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation of Indoles with N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a general rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intermolecular dearomative cyclopropanation of indoles using trifluoromethyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. The reaction enables the rapid construction of diverse cyclopropane fused indolines bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocenter in high enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). This mild method exhibits a broad substrate scope, is compatible with various functional groups, and can even be utilized for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex bioactive molecules. DFT calculations suggest that the formation of a key zwitterionic intermediate is responsible for the chiral induction. Overall, this approach opens up new possibilities for asymmetric cyclopropanation of challenging aromatic heterocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Anionic Coordination Manipulation Induces Phosphorus and Boron&#8208;Rich Gradient Interphase Towards Stable and Safe Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage sodium metal batteries (SMBs) present a viable pathway towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;based batteries due to the competitive cost advantage and abundant supply of sodium resources. However, they still suffer from severe capacity decay induced by the notorious decomposition of the electrolyte under high voltage and unstable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). In addition, the high reactivity of Na metal and flammable electrolytes push SMBs to their safety limits. Herein, a special dual&#8208;anion aggregated Na+ solvation structure is designed in a nonflammable trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, and a gradient CEI enriched with phosphorus and boron compounds is formed on the cathode. This thin and stable interphase effectively suppresses the parasitic reaction, improves the interfacial stability of the cathode, and facilitates Na+ transport through the interface by the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;components, thus optimizing the cycling stability and safety of SMBs. The Na0.95Ni0.4Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2//Na batteries employing such electrolyte provide a discharge capacity of 167.5 mA h g&#8722;1 and high retention in the capacity of 85.2% after 800 cycles at 1 C. This approach offers a general strategy for the design of flame&#8208;retardant high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and the practical application of SMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Resistance Gene&#8208;Guided Discovery of the Molecular Basis for Biosynthesis of the Fatty Acid&#160;Synthase Inhibitor Cerulenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cerulenin (1) is the first reported natural fatty acid synthase inhibitor and has been intensively researched for its antifungal, anticancer and anti&#8208;obesity properties. However, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis has remained a mystery for six decades. Here, we have identified the polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster (cer) responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 from two Sarocladium species using a self&#8208;resistance gene mining approach, which we validated via heterologous reconstitution of cer cluster in an Aspergillus nidulans host. Expression of various combinations of cer genes uncovered key pathway intermediates, electrocyclisation products derived from PKS&#8208;encoded polyenoic acids, and a suite of 13 new analogues of 1. This enabled us to establish a biosynthetic pathway to 1 that starts with a C12 polyketide precursor with both E and Z double bonds and involves a complex series of epoxidations, double bond shifts, E/Z isomerisation and epoxide reduction. Using in vitro assays, we further validated the roles of amidotransferase CerD in amidation, and oxidase CerF and reductase CerE in the final two&#8208;electron oxidation and enone reduction steps towards 1. These findings expand our understanding of complex tailoring modifications in highly reducing PKS pathways and pave the way for the engineered biosynthesis of cerulenin analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen bonds enable efficient photoreduction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding interactions have attracted significant attention in a broad chemistry community, with a particular focus on their ability to stabilise the key transition states in various organic synthetic routes. In this work, we demonstrate that they can also be harnessed in selective photoredox reactions, which cannot be otherwise achieved with alternative approaches to photoreduction. We demonstrate this concept through the photoreduction of the sulfur&#8208;containing DNA nucleoside precursor thioanhydrouridine to 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;thiouridine, revealing the previously unrecognized role of bisulfide in this process. Based on quantum chemical simulations, we identify a stable chalcogen&#8208;bonding complex of the hydrosulfide anion and thionhydrouridine (HS&#8208;&#8230;S contacts), which enables directional photoinduced electron transfer, resulting in the formation of non&#8208;canonical DNA nucleoside. We also disprove the possibility that photoreduction of thioanhydronucleosides could be initiated by hydrated electrons generated from irradiated bisulfide anions which do not interact with the chromophore. Finally, we show that selective photoreduction mediated by chalcogen bonds can only occur for chromophores, which exhibit sufficiently long excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the locally&#8208;excited states to undergo transition to the productive charge transfer state. These findings can be further used in the design of similar photoredox reactions which can employ the potential of chalcogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Helically Twisted Conjugated Frameworks Consisting of Alternant Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Units and Multiple Boron Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel design strategy to construct bright and narrow near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission materials with suppressed shoulder peaks can significantly enhance their performance in various applications. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a series of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems bridged by boron atoms, achieving bright red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions with notably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 35 nm (0.08 eV) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 80%. These compounds display redshifted emissions up to 753 nm in higher concentrations. Cis/trans configurational isomers of multi&#8208;boron&#8208;bridged molecule BN3 exhibit similar photophysical properties. The unique combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and the helically twisted conjugated framework is pivotal in achieving the redshifted, narrowband emission. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of BN2 and BN3&#8208;a reveals that the extension of boron&#8208;bridged D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A skeletons significantly increases the distortion of the skeleton. Systematic theoretical calculations show how the boron CE&#8208;CT mechanism, in conjunction with the helical twist, leads to the narrowing of emission bands while simultaneously red&#8208;shifting them into the NIR region. This work could open new avenues for the development of advanced materials with tailored optical properties, particularly in the challenging and highly sought&#8208;after NIR spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Carbazole&#8208;Tailored Luminescent Triarylmethyl Radical and its Stable Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel luminescent radicals, characterized by their unique doublet emission, endows a significant challenge. In this study, we reported the synthesis of a luminescent neutral radical, BCzAnM&#8208;R, tailored by two carbazolyl groups and an anthryl group to achieve a nonalternant structure. It exhibited near&#8208;infrared emission with a peak at 1020 nm in toluene. Interestingly, its corresponding cation, BCzAnM&#8208;C, was synthesized through an unconventional SnCl2&#8208;mediated reduction&#8208;aromatization&#8208;oxidation reaction in one&#8208;pot and gram&#8208;scale. The cation demonstrated remarkable stability for up to weeks in ambient conditions and facilitated the silica&#8208;gel chromatography isolation as an organic salt with SnCl3&#8208;&#160;as the counter ion. The carbazolyl groups effectively modulate molecular structures, photophysical properties, and stabilities. Notably, BCzAnM&#8208;R represents the first luminescent triarylmethyl radical with two carbazolyl groups directly attached to the central carbon.</dc:description>

However, there are several major obstacles to conventional phototherapy&#8208;mediated immune responses, including inadequate immunogenicity and immunosuppressive environment. Here, we present a novel photoimmunotherapy modality&#8212;the development of membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule inducing plasma membrane rupture (PMR) by NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;stimulation, thus evoking cell necrotic death and enhancing antitumor immunotherapy. Our top&#8208;performing membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule (CBT&#8208;3) exhibits temperature&#8208;tunable PMR efficiency, allowing rapid necrotic death in cancer cells at 50 &#956;M dose by using exogenous NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated mild photothermal effect (1064 nm, 0.6 W cm&#8722;2). Further evidence indicated that this gentle therapeutic approach activated inflammatory signaling pathways in cells, enhanced immunogenic cell death, and reshaped the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, ultimately promoting systemic antitumor immune responses in vivo. This study represents the first instance of utilizing NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;amplified PMR effect based on membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule, providing a novel avenue for advancing cancer photoimmunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Polycondensation Flux Synthesis of Ultrastable Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating new functional materials that efficiently support noble metal catalysts is important and in high demand. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;polycondensation flux synthesis strategy that can produce olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platforms with high crystallinity and porosity as the supports of Pd nanoparticles for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). A series of "two in one" monomers integrating aldehyde and methyl reactive groups are rationally designed to afford COFs with square&#8208;shaped pores and ultrahigh chemical stability (e.g., strong acid or alkali environments for &gt;1 month). Functionalizing Fluorine significantly boosts the hydrophobicity of fluoro&#8208;functionalized COFs, which can inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhance ENRR performances. The COFs loading Pd nanoparticles show high NH3 production yields up to 90.0 &#177; 2.6 &#956;g&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mgcat.&#8722;1 and the faradaic efficiency of 44% at &#8722;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the best comprehensive performance among all reported COFs. Meanwhile, the catalysts are easy to recover and recycle, as demonstrated by their use for 15 cycles and 17 hours, with good performance retention. This work not only provides a new synthesis strategy for olefin&#8208;linked COFs, but also paves a new avenue for the design of highly efficient ENRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrogenations are fundamentally and industrially important reactions that are atom economical paths to synthesize value&#8208;added products from feedstock chemicals. The cooperative effects of two or more metal centers in multimetallic active sites is a successful strategy to activate small molecules and facilitate catalytic reactions, and this strategy has been recently applied to catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, heterobimetallic complexes have been well&#8208;documented to provide novel reaction pathways and improved selectivity, compared to their homo&#8208;bimetallic and monometallic analogues. This minireview provides a historical perspective on the development of heterobimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and describes recent developments in this burgeoning research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifications of Prenyl Side Chains in Natural Product Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the enzymatic machinery responsible for the modifications of prenyl side chains and elucidating their roles in natural product biosynthesis. This interest stems from the pivotal role such modifications play in shaping the structural and functional diversity of natural products, as well as from their potential applications to synthetic biology and drug discovery. In addition to contributing to the diversity and complexity of natural products, unique modifications of prenyl side chains are represented by several novel biosynthetic mechanisms. Representative unique examples of epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, unusual C&#8208;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization are summarized and discussed. By revealing the intriguing chemistry and enzymology behind these transformations, this comprehensive and comparative review will guide future efforts in the discovery, characterization and application of modifications of prenyl side chains in natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Photocatalytic Generation by Silanized TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A commercial TiO2 sample, used as received or hydrothermally treated to increase surface hydroxylation, has been functionalized by surface modification with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane. The anchoring of the&#160;silane has been characterized by&#160;FTIR and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopies, and the grafting density was determined by thermogravimetric and N2 physisorption analyses. The silane moieties induce a partial decrease of the shielding of the valence electrons of the Ti ions at the surface, and a local modification of their crystal field, as demonstrated by XPS and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, respectively. The changes in coordination and the produced oxygen vacancies result in the formation of Ti3+ defects localized in the sub&#8208;surface region, as revealed by EPR spectroscopy. These paramagnetic centers are stabilized in the silanized samples, as the electron transfer to O2 is efficiently inhibited even under UV irradiation. However, the amount of Ti3+ centers appears to be correlated with the singlet oxygen (1O2) formation rate. Accordingly, epoxidation of limonene under UV light, chosen as a model photocatalytic reaction triggered by 1O2, occurred with higher selectivity when TiO2 was silanized and upon simultaneous NIR irradiation. These evidences suggest that in the silanized sample 1O2 may be generated through F&#246;rster&#8208;type energy transfer from excited sub&#8208;surface Ti3+ centers.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Unactivated Olefins Enabled by Voltage&#8208;Gated Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present the first successful hydrotrifluoromethylation of unactivated olefins under electrochemical conditions. Commercially available trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt (TT+&#8208;CF3BF4&#8208;, Ep/2 = &#8211;0.85 V vs Fc/Fc+) undergoes electrochemical reduction to generate CF3 radicals which add to olefins with exclusive chemoselectivity. The resulting carbon centered radical undergoes a second cathodic reduction, instead of a classical HAT process, to generate a carbanion that can be terminated by protonation from solvent. The use of MgBr2 (+0.20 V onset oxidation potential) plays a key role as an enabling sacrificial reductant for the reaction to operate in an undivided cell. Guided by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies, fine&#8208;tuning the solvent system, trifluoromethylating reagent&#8217;s counteranion and careful selection of redox processes, this work led to the development of a voltage&#8208;gated electrosynthesis by pairing two redox processes with a narrow potential difference (&#916;E &#8776; 1.00 V) allowing the reaction to proceed with two important advances: (a) high reactivity and selectivity towards hydrotrifluoromethylation over undesired dibromination, and (b) an unprecedented functional group tolerance, including aniline, phenols, unprotected alcohol, epoxide, trialkyl amine, and several redox sensitive heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>When Metal Complexes Evolve, and a Minor Species Is the Most Active: the Case of Bis(Phenanthroline)Copper in the Catalysis of Glutathione Oxidation and Hydroxyl Radical Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several copper&#8208;ligands, including 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), have been investigated for anticancer purposes based on their capacity to bind excess copper (Cu) in cancer tissues and form redox active complexes able to catalyse the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Glutathione (GSH) is a critical compound as it is highly concentrated intracellularly and can reduce and dissociate copper(II) from the ligand forming poorly redox&#8208;active copper(I)&#8208;thiolate clusters. Here we report that Cu&#8208;Phen2 &#160;speciation evolves in physiologically relevant GSH concentrations. Experimental and computational experiments suggest that at pH 7.4 mostly copper(I)&#8208;GSH clusters are formed, but a minor species of copper(I) bound to one Phen and forming ternary complexes with GSH (GS&#8208;Cu&#8208;Phen) is the redox active species, oxidizing quite efficiently GSH to GSSG and forming HO&#8226; radicals. This minor active species becomes more populated at lower pH, such as typical lysosomal pH 5, resulting in faster GSH oxidation and HO&#8226; production. Consistently, cell culture studies showed lower toxicity of Cu&#8208;Phen2 upon inhibition of lysosomal acidification. Overall, this study underscores that sub&#8208;cellular localisation can considerably influence the speciation of Cu&#8208;based drugs and that minor species can be the most redox&#8208; and biologically&#8208; active.</dc:description>

Overall, this study underscores that sub-cellular localisation can considerably influence the speciation of Cu-based drugs and that minor species can be the most redox- and biologically- active.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 Over 800 Hours</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology for green hydrogen production. Although the normal current densities of AEMWEs are below 3 A&#183;cm&#8208;2, operating them at higher current densities represents an efficient, but little&#8208;explored approach to decrease the total cost of hydrogen production. We show here that a benchmark AEMWE has an operational lifetime of only seconds at an ultrahigh current density of 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2. By using a more conductive and robust AEM, and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer, we have developed AEMWEs that stably operate at 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 with extended lifetimes. The optimized AEMWE has an operational lifetime of more than 800 hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over the current benchmark. The cell voltage is only 2.3 V at 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2, comparable to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices operating at current densities lower than 3 A&#183;cm&#8208;2. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrahigh current density AEMWEs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Electron&#8208;Density Distribution of UCl4&#160;and Its Topology from X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of $5f$ electrons in actinide complexes and materials is still poorly understood and represents a serious challenge and opportunity for experiment and theory. The study of the electron density distribution of the ground state of such systems through X&#8208;ray diffraction represents a unique opportunity to quantitatively investigate different chemical bonding interactions at once, but was considered ``almost impossible'' on heavy&#8208;atom systems, until very recently. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the electron density distribution in UCl$_4$ crystals and comparison with the previously reported spin density distribution from polarized neutron diffraction. All approaches provide a consistent picture in terms of electron and spin density distribution, and chemical bond characterization. More importantly, the synergy between experiments and quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations allows to highlight the remarkable&#160;sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to $5f$ electrons in materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Evidence of a Stable RNA G&#8208;triplex Structure at Physiological Temperature in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RG1 is a quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome proposed as possible therapeutic target for COVID&#8208;19. We demonstrate that the dominant conformation of RG1 under physiological conditions differs from the parallel quadruplex previously assumed. Through comprehensive investigations employing CD, UV, NMR, DSC, gel electrophoresis, MD simulations, in silico spectroscopy and the use of truncated RG1 sequences, we have identified this stable conformation as an RNA G&#8208;triplex composed of two G&#8208;triads. We believe this previously unreported RNA structure could serve as a novel therapeutic target. Our findings open new avenues for further studies on the presence and biological role of RNA G&#8208;triplexes in vivo.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds involving the oxygen atoms of intermediates that result from copper&#8208;mediated O2 activation play a key role for controlling the reactivity of Cux/O2 active sites in metalloenzymes and synthetic model complexes. However, structural insight into H&#8208;bonding in such transient species as well as thermodynamic information about proton transfer to or from the O2&#8208;derived ligands is scarce.

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Product selectivity of solar-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts.

Notably, the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar-to-chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non-concentrated solar irradiation.

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health.

&lt;p&gt;We report a high-precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV-1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV-1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS-SH) and polysulfide (RS-S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion-localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV-1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV-1 latency and reactivation.

         <title>Front Cover: Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonylation reactions introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) into a molecule to produce key chemicals including carboxylic acids, esters, and amides that are abundant in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and plastics. In their Research Article (e202410928), Robert S. Paton, Garret M. Miyake et al. developed a photocatalytic carbonylation strategy, which enables the conversion of alkyl halides to esters or amides under metal&#8208;free conditions. Additionally, this strategy allows for complete incorporation of the 13C isotope.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;site bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction. The crucial role of hybrid dual sites is determined and assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water. A record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at 18&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution and a low voltage for overall water splitting was achieved on these heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8722;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in situ formed Fe&#8722;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at current density of 18.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

         <dc:description>
In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spoked wheels containing fluorene spokes were successfully prepared and characterized by various methods, including scanning tunneling microscopy. Their synthetic accessibility was correlated with quantum chemical calculations using geometric and energetic criteria, the former extracted from the theoretically proposed mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling, the latter from experimental cyclophane synthesis.







Abstract
A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes, and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling lead to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SBnCln Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral closo&#8208;boranes of various sizes by co&#8208;pyrolyzing the simple electron&#8208;precise synthons S2Cl2 and B2Cl4 at 280&#8201;&#176;C, closo&#8208;SB5Cl5, closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 and closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction. MS spectra and computations evidenced the recurrent formation of further closo&#8208;SBnCln , with n=4, 6, 10, and also with 12 designed for the supra&#8208;icosahedral architecture.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-boranes of various sizes by co-pyrolyzing the simple electron-precise synthons S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 280&#8201;&#176;C, &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-SB&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-1-SB&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-SB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction.

The compounds are sublimable, off-white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one- and two-dimensional &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B NMR spectroscopy and X-ray structure determination for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Ab initio&lt;/i&gt;/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square-antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, respectively, as expected based on their &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-electron counts. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid-state structure of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is one of the rare examples of a single-crystal X-ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal-packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass-spectrometry evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-SB&lt;sub&gt;

         <dc:description>
We explored the Polymer&#8208;Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal&#8208;free sodium&#8208;doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na+ and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H2 exposure. This FLP&#8208;inspired approach promises advances in main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH3) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8722;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&#8722;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by high&#8208;entropy concept, an multicomponent (MC) electrical double layer (EDL) structure is constructed by the addition of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions into electrolytes. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between these additives, the Zn|Cu half cell achieves a high average CE of 99.5&#8201;% with a high Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibits a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.







Abstract
Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter &#8211; a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement &#8211; was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5&#8201;% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3&#8201;%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.

Small Fish, big moves: In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

         <title>Back Cover: Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible-light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;Capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel dissymmetric quinoidal molecules end&#8208;capped by dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium were reported and their formation mechanism was proposed. The respective zwitterionic forms make contributions to their ground state structures. Of particular note is the observation that their emissions can be switched on by increasing the solution viscosity, by dispersing them in polymer matrix, or upon binding with certain proteins.







Abstract
A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.

Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure. The synergistic effect of the Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8211;*CO coupling to generate *CH2CHO species, leading to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2&#8722;to&#8722;EtOH performance, as reported by Jin Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409270).

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale autonomous oscillatory motion was achieved upon the reduction of a perylenediimide disk at the solid&#8208;water interface. This redox&#8208;activated, self&#8208;propelled system can be modulated through variations in chemical structure and molecular alignment, offering a unique avenue for the construction of molecularly designed active matter.







Abstract
The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8208;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water&#8208;soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of the imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented organocatalytic asymmetric entry to a range of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer catalysis was developed. The utilization of this protocol enables the remote desymmetric functionalization of prochiral cages with high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, diverse late&#8208;stage molecular editing of chiral prism&#8208;like cages was primed for an array of high&#8208;value chiral compounds.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.

         <title>Biocatalytic Ether Lipid Synthesis by an Archaeal Glycerolprenylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Remarkably, it does so through carbocation&#8208;type chemistry in a fully solvent&#8208;exposed active site.







Abstract
Although ethers are common in secondary natural products, they are an underrepresented functional group in primary metabolism. As such, there are comparably few enzymes capable of constructing ether bonds in a general fashion. However, such enzymes are highly sought after for synthetic applications as they typically operate with higher regioselectivity and under milder conditions than traditional organochemical approaches. To expand the repertoire of well characterized ether synthases, we herein report on a promiscuous archaeal prenyltransferase from the scarcely researched family of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthases (GGGPSs or G3PSs). We show that the ultrastable Archaeoglobus fulgidus G3PS makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Based on experimental and computational data, we propose a mechanism for this enzyme which involves an intermediary prenyl carbocation equivalent. As such, this study provides the fundamental understanding and methods to introduce G3PSs into the biocatalytic alkylation toolbox.

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>

         <dc:description>
New phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetanes bearing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with different electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs were shown to have an accelerated chemiexcitation and increased stability compared to previously reported 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe containing a six&#8208;member sulfone unit exhibited increased detection sensitivity toward &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expressing bacteria in growth medium.







Abstract
The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth medium. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our innovative unimolecular multiple&#8208;activatable photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) ingeniously integrates specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH into a single molecular platform, thereby enabling the simultaneous monitoring of NE activity and oxidative stress with minimal cross&#8208;reactivity, by modulating the photoinduced electron transfer and conjugation effect, respectively.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques. UMAPP, comprising a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, facilitates NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer impacting photoacoustic intensity at 685&#8197;nm (PA685). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction of catechol groups by O2&#8901;&#8722; and GSH induce reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum (PA745/PA685 ratio). Initial UMAPP applications successfully distinguished atherosclerotic and healthy mice, evaluated pneumonia&#8216;s effect on plaque composition and verified the probe&#8216;s effectiveness in drug&#8208;treatment studies by detecting molecular alterations before visible histopathological changes. The integrated molecular imaging capabilities of UMAPP offer promising advancements in atherosclerosis diagnosis and management, enabling early and accurate identification of vulnerable plaques.

         <title>Supramolecular Anchoring of Fe(III) Molecular Redox Catalysts into Graphitic Surfaces Via CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile model has been developed for supramolecular anchoring including CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, between iron porphyrin catalysts and graphitic surfaces, enabling a high&#8208;performance molecular electrode for aqueous CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical devices require solid anodes and cathodes for the easy assembling of the whole cell and thus redox catalysts need to be deposited on the electrodes. Typical catalyst deposition involves drop casting, spin coating, doctor blading or related techniques to generate modified electrodes where the active catalyst in contact with the electrolyte is only a very small fraction of the deposited mass. We have developed a methodology where the redox catalyst is deposited at the electrode based on supramolecular interactions, namely CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; between the catalyst and the surface. This generates a very well&#8208;defined catalysts&#8208;surface structure and electroactivity, together with a very large catalytic response. This approach represents a new anchoring strategy that can be applied to catalytic redox reactions in heterogeneous phase and compared to traditional methods involves about 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude less mass deposition to achieve comparable activity and with very well&#8208;behaved electroactivity and stability.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens (hetero&#8208;POINT) has been developed to rationalize the design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. Immunological investigations reveal that the pattern of heterotypic antigen distribution yields distinct humoral and mucosal immune effects, highlighting the significance of the spatial placement of the antigens in structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.

     alt="High-Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy-Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous high-entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft-acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard-acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion-oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial-level current density for long-time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical-chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion-rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy-saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high-entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra-low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and the constructed &#8220;soft-acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard-acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical-chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value-added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Customizing H2O&#8208;Poor Electric Double Layer and Boosting Texture Exposure of Zn (101) Plane towards Super&#8208;High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catastrophic dendrite hyperplasia and parasitic reactions severely impede the future deployment of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Controlling zinc orientation growth is considered to be an effective method to overcome the aforementioned concerns, especially for regulating the (002) plane of deposited Zn. Unfortunately, Zn (002) texture is difficult to obtain stable cycling under high deposition capacity resulting from its large lattice distortion and nonuniform distribution in electric field. Herein, different from traditional cognition, a crystallization orientation regulation tactic is proposed to boost Zn (101) texture exposure and inhibit zinc dendrite proliferation during plating/stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate the malate molecules preferentially adsorb on the Zn (002) facet, leading to the texture exposure of distinctive Zn (101) plane. Meanwhile, the &#8211;COOH and &#8211;OH groups of malate molecules exhibit strong adsorption on the Zn anode surface and chelate with Zn2+, achieving&#160;H2O&#8208;poor&#160;electrical double layer. Very impressively, the multifunctional malate additive enlists zinc anode to survive for 600 h under a harsh condition of 15 mAh cm&#8722;2/15 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the symmetric cell harvests highly&#8208;reversible cycling life of 6600 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2/1.25 mAh cm&#8722;2, remarkably outperforming the ZnSO4 electrolyte. The assembled Zn//MnO2 full cells also demonstrate prominent electrochemical reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Restocking Strategy for the Direct Reuse of Degraded LiFePO4 Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries calls for efficient recycling technologies for spent LFP (SLFP). Even for the advanced direct material regeneration (DMR) method, multiple steps including separation, regeneration, and electrode refabrication processes are still needed. To circumvent these intricacies, new regeneration methods that allow direct electrode reuse (DER) by rejuvenating SLFP electrodes without damaging its structure are desired. Here, a 0.1 M lithium triethyl borohydride/tetrahydrofuran solution, which has the proper reductive capability to reduce Fe3+ in SLFP to Fe2+ without alloying with the aluminum current collector, is selected as the lithiation/regeneration reagent to restock the Li loss and regenerate SLFP electrodes. By soaking the SLFP electrodes in the lithiation solution, we successfully rejuvenated the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of SLFP electrodes with structural integrity within only 6 minutes at room temperature. When being directly reused, the regenerated LFP electrodes deliver a high specific capacity of 162.6 mAh g&#8208;1 even after being exposed to air for 3 months. The DER strategy presents significant economic and environmental benefits compared with the DMR method. This research provides a timely and innovative solution for recycling spent blade batteries using large&#8208;sized LFP electrodes, boosting the closed&#8208;loop development of LFP batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ryanodane Diterpenoids Garajonone and 3&#8208;epi&#8208;Garajonone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ryanodane diterpenes are structurally complex natural products that are well&#8208;known for their high degree of oxidation and the challenges associated with synthesizing them within the terpene class. Herein, we present a two&#8208;stage synthetic strategy that draws inspiration from the broad biosynthesis of terpenes, allowing us to successfully achieve the first chemical synthesis of garajonone, a ryanodane diterpenoid that occurs naturally at low abundance, as well as its epimer, 3&#8208;epi&#8208;garajonone. The key to this success lies in the rapid construction of the carbon framework of target molecule by employing an early&#8208;stage palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck/carbonylative esterification cascade annulation, followed by successive late&#8208;stage selective redox manipulation to establish the desired oxidation state of the molecule. This research not only showcases the synthesis of garajonone and its epimer but also provides a platform for the chemical synthesis of other members and analogs within this complex diterpenoid family.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Pillared Interlayer Design for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is a promising way to attain higher energy density at lower cost beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion battery technology. However, the major issues blocking their practical application are the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions for sulfur and polysulfides. Here, pillaring multilayer graphene with the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) demonstrates the substantial impact of a versatile interlayer design in tackling those issues. Unlike regular composite separators reported so far, the participation of tri&#8208;metallic Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn MOF (NCM&#8208;MOF) as pillars supports the construction of an ion&#8208;channel interconnected interlayer structure, unexpectedly balancing the interfacial concentration polarization, spatially confining the soluble polysulfides and vastly affording lithiophilic sites for highly efficient polysulfide sieving/conversion. As a demonstration, we show that the MOF&#8208;pillared interlayer structure enables outstanding capacity (1634 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C) and longevity (average capacity decay of 0.034% per cycle in 2000 cycles) of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Besides, the multilayer separator can be readily integrated into the high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.91Mn0.03Co0.06O2)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which efficiently suppresses the undesired phase evolution upon cycling. These findings suggest the potential of &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; materials in fabricating multi&#8208;functional separators, bring forward the pillared interlayer structure for energy&#8208;storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silver&#8211;Isocyanide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied due to their versatile applications and easily tunable structures. However, heteroatom&#8208;metal coordination dominates the MOFs community, and the rational synthesis of carbon&#8211;metal coordination&#8208;based MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOFs based on silver&#8211;carbon linkages are synthesized through the coordination between silver(I) salt and isocyanide&#8208;based monomers at ambient condition. The as&#8208;synthesized 2D MOFs possess well&#8208;defined crystalline structures and a staggered AB stacking mode. Most interestingly, these 2D MOFs, without &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between layers, exhibit narrow bandgaps down to 1.42 eV. As electrochemical catalysts for converting CO2 to CO, such 2D MOFs demonstrate Faradaic efficiency over 92%. Surprisingly, the CO2 reduction catalyzed by these MOFs indicates favorable adsorption of CO2 and *COOH on the active carbon sites of the isocyanide groups rather than on silver sites. This is attributed to the critical &#963; donor role of isocyanides and the corresponding ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8211;transfer effect. This work not only paves the way toward a new family of MOFs based on metal&#8211;isocyanide coordination but also offers a rare platform for understanding the electrocatalysis processes on strongly polarized carbon species.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Electron Channels Enable Contact Prelithiation of Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes with Ultrahigh Li&#8208;Source Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contact prelithiation is widely used for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the low Li&#8208;source utilization suffering from the deteriorated contact interfaces results in cycling degeneration. Herein, Li&#8722;Ag alloy&#8208;based artificial electron channels (AECs) are established in Li source/graphite anode contact interfaces to promote Li&#8208;source conversion. Due to the shielding effect of the Li&#8722;Ag alloy (50 at. % Li) on Li&#8208;ion diffusion, the dry&#8208;state corrosion of contact interfaces is restricted. The unblocked electronic conduction across the AEC&#8208;involved interface not only facilitates the Li source conversion but also accelerates the prelithiation kinetics during the wet&#8208;state process, resulting in an ultrahigh Li&#8208;source utilization (90.7%). Thereby, implementing AEC&#8208;assisted prelithiation in a LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell yields a 35.8% increase in energy density and stable cycling over 600 cycles. This finding affords significant insights into the construction of an efficient prelithiation technology toward the development of high&#8208;energy LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cu11Ag3 Nanotips for Ultrahigh Yield Rate of Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NRA) offers a sustainable approach for NH3 production and NO3&#8208; removal but suffers from low NH3 yield rate (&lt;1.20 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2). We present bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment and tip&#8208;enhanced effects, which achieve an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at a low applied potential of &#8208;0.33 V vs. RHE, a high Faradic efficiency (FE) of 98.8%, and long&#8208;term operation stability at 1800 mg&#8208;N L&#8208;1 NO3&#8208;, outperforming most of the recently reported catalysts. At a NO3&#8208; concentration as low as 15 mg&#8208;N L&#8208;1, it still delivers a high FE of 86.9% and an NH3 selectivity of 93.8%. Operando ATR&#8208;FTIR spectra, finite&#8208;element method, and DFT calculations reveal that the Cu11Ag3 exhibits reduced adsorption energy barrier of *N intermediates, favorable water dissociation for *H generation and high energy barrier for H2 formation, while its tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment promoting NO3&#8208; accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Lithography Sensitivity of Atomically Precise Tin&#8208;Oxo Nanoclusters via Heterometal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin&#8208;oxo clusters are increasingly recognized as promising materials for nanolithography technology due to their unique properties, yet their structural impacts on lithography performance remain underexplored. This work explores the structural impacts of heterometal strategies on the performance of tin&#8208;oxo clusters in nanolithography, focusing on various metal dopants and their coordination geometries. Specifically, SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2 were synthesized and characterized. These clusters demonstrate excellent solubility, dispersibility, and stability, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;quality films via spin&#8208;coating for lithographic applications. Notably, this work innovatively employs nano&#8208;infrared (nano&#8208;IR), neutron reflectivity (NR), and X&#8208;ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements to confirm film homogeneity. Upon electron beam lithography (EBL), all four materials achieve 50 nm line patterns, with SnOC&#8208;1(In) demonstrating the highest lithography sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to indium dopants, which possess superior EUV absorption capabilities and unsaturated coordination environments. Further studies on exposure mechanisms indicated that Sn&#8211;C bond cleavage generates butyl free radicals, promoting network formations that induce solubility&#8208;switching behaviors for lithography. These findings underscore the efficacy of tailored structural design and modulation of cluster materials through heterometal strategies in enhancing lithography performance, offering valuable insights for future material design and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulky Phosphazenium Salt Controlling Chemoselective Terpolymerization of Epoxide, Anhydride and CO2: From Well&#8208;Defined Block to Truly Random Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copolymers with precise compositions and controlled sequences are great appealing for high&#8208;performance polymeric materials, but their synthesis is very challenging. In this study, tetrakis[tris(dimethylamino)phosphoranylidenamino]  phosphonium chloride  (P5Cl) and triethylboron (TEB) were chosen as the binary catalyst to synthesize both well&#8208;defined block and truly random poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers via the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step terpolymerization of epoxide/anhydride/CO2 under metal&#8208;free conditions. The bulky nature of phosphazenium cation not only led to loose cation&#8722;anion pairs and enhanced the reactivity, but also provided the chain&#8208;end an appropriate protection and improved the controllability. In particular, P5Cl/TEB with a molar ratio of 1/0.5 showed an extraordinary chemoselectivity for ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) first and then ROAC of CHO/CO2. Thus, well&#8208;defined block polyester&#8208;polycarbonate copolymers were synthesized by CHO/PA/CO2 terpolymerization. The chemoselectivity was easily tuned and the ROAC of CHO/PA and ROAC of CHO/CO2 occurred simultaneously with P5Cl/TEB = 1/2, producing truly random poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers from CHO/PA/CO2. In addition, this P5Cl/TEB catalyst and the strategy to regulate its chemoselectivity are versatile for various anhydrides, epoxides and initiators. Thus, poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers with varying sequences, compositions, and topologies are successfully synthesized, making it possible to compare their properties and to expand their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial&#160;Lithium Channels Built from Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to numerous artificial potassium channels developed over the past decade, the study of artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels has remained limited. We demonstrate here the use of an interesting class of polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM) for constructing artificial lithium channels. These PIM&#8208;derived lithium channels show exceptionally efficient (&#947;Li+ &gt; 40 pS) and highly selective transport of Li+ ions, with selectivity factors of &gt; 10 against both Na+ and K+. By simply adjusting the initial reaction temperature, we can tune the transport property in a way that PIMs synthesized at initial reaction temperatures of 60 &#176;C and 80&#176;C exhibit improved transport efficiency and selectivity, respectively, in the dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine&#160; membrane.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) are important gaseous biological signaling molecules that are involved in complex cellular pathways. A number of physiological processes require both H2S and NO, which has led to the proposal that different H2S/NO&#8226; crosstalk species, including thionitrite (SNO&#8211;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8211;), are responsible for this observed codependence. Despite the importance of these S/N hybrid species, the reported properties and characterization, as well as the fundamental pathways of formation and subsequent reactivity, remain poorly understood. Herein we report new experimental insights into the fundamental reaction chemistry of pathways to form SNO&#8211; and SSNO&#8211;, including mechanisms for proton&#8208;mediated interconversion. In addition, we demonstrate new modes of reactivity with other sulfur&#8208;containing potential crosstalk species, including carbonyl sulfide (COS).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes offer high theoretical capacity for lithium&#8208;ion batteries but suffer from severe volume changes and continuous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation. Here, we address these challenges by selective methylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), thus shifting the unstable bulk polymerization to controlled interfacial reactions and resulting in a highly elastic SEI. Comparative studies of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (2MDOL) and 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (4MDOL) reveal that 4MDOL, with its larger ring strain and more stable radical intermediates due to hyperconjugation effect, promotes the formation of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymeric species at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This elastic, polymer&#8208;rich SEI effectively accommodates volume changes of Si and inhibits continuous side reactions. Our designed electrolyte enables Si&#8208;based anode to achieve 85.4% capacity retention after 400 cycles at 0.5 C without additives, significantly outperforming conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes. Full cells also demonstrate stable long&#8208;term cycling. This work provides new insights into molecular&#8208;level electrolyte design for high&#8208;performance Si anodes, offering a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced energy density and longevity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Production of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Covalent Enzyme Immobilization with Boosted Enzymatic Catalysis by Solar&#8208;Driven Photothermal Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new enzyme&#8208;immobilization systems to stabilize their dynamic structures and meanwhile enhance their catalytic activity is of great significance but very challenging. Herein, we design and fabricate a class of robust mesoporous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction. It is found that highly crystalline COFs can be produced in 10 min, which is attributed to the promoting effect of the intramolecular hydrogen bond activation. The COFs rich in hydroxyl groups can be facilely post&#8208;modified by epibromohydrin to covalently immobilize enzymes with both high loading and activity. Furthermore, we create a solar&#8208;driven photothermal&#8208;promoted strategy by introducing photoactive azo groups to COF carriers, which can boost the enzyme catalytic performance (lipase) with much higher conversion of various racemic substrates and chiral resolution upon solar light irradiation. The heterogeneous biocatalysts also demonstrate exceptional reusability and stability. This work provides a green and energy&#8208;efficient approach to facilitate the scale application of enzyme&#8208;immobilized biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Induces Hydrogen Spillover and Platinum Utilization in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substantial promotion of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance relies on the breakup of the Sabatier principle, which can be achieved by the alternation of the support and electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) is noticed. Due to the utilization of tungsten disulfides as support for platinum (Pt@WS2), surprisingly, Pt@WS2 demands only 31 mV overpotential to attain 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in acidic HER test, corresponding to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher mass activity than benchmarked Pt/C. The pH dependent electrochemical measurements associated with H2&#8208;TPD and in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy indicate a hydrogen spillover involved HER mechanism is confirmed. The WS2 support triggers a higher hydrogen binding strength for Pt leading to the increment in hydrogen concentration at Pt sites proved by upshifted d band center as well as lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen, favourable for hydrogen spillover. Besides, the WS2 shows a comparably lower effect on Gibbs free energy for different Pt layers (&#8208;0.50 eV layer&#8208;1) than carbon black (&#8208;0.88 eV layer&#8208;1) contributing to a better Pt utilization. Also, the theoretical calculation suggests the hydrogen spillover occurs on the 3rd Pt layer in Pt@WS2; moreover, the energy barrier is lowered with increment in hydrogen coverage on Pt.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright Nanocomposites based on Quantum Dot&#8208;Initiated Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating quantum dots (QDs) into polymer matrix to form nanocomposites without compromising the QD photoluminescence (PL) is crucial to emerging QD light&#8208;emitting and solar energy conversion fields. However, the most widely&#8208;used bulk polymerization technique, where monomers serve as the QD solvent, usually leads to QD PL quenching caused by radical initiators. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;brightness nanocomposites with near&#8208;unity PL quantum yield (QY), through a novel QDs&#8208;catalyzed (&#8208;initiated) bulk polymerization without using any radical initiators. Different from previous reports where QDs were designed as photo&#8208;sensitizers/catalysts (always with cocatalysts) and hence non&#8208;emissive in catalytic conditions, our QDs combine high brightness with highly effective catalysis, a combination that was previously considered to be hardly possible. In our case, apart from emitting light (at a large probability), the photoexcited QDs act as &#8216;overall reaction&#8217; catalysts by simultaneously employing photoexcited electrons and holes to produce active radicals without the need of any sacrificial agents. These active radicals, though with a small amount, are sufficient to initiate effective chain reaction&#8208;dominated bulk polymerization, eliminating the requirement of extra radical initiators. This study provides new insights for understanding and development of QDs for energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Cell&#8208;Mediated Catalyst&#8208;Free Spontaneous Polymerization of Zwitterionic Methacrylates for Preparation of Probiotic&#8208;Loaded Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living cell&#8208;mediated polymerization offers promising applications in biomaterials, yet its further biological utilization is hindered by the need for metal ions or radical initiators with available methods. In this study, we introduce a living cell&#8208;mediated polymerization that leverages the intrinsic metabolic activities of living cells to initiate and sustain free radical polymerization of zwitterionic methacrylates. The polymerization proceeded in the absence of transition metal catalysts, radical initiators, or light sources. The conversion of zwitterionic methacrylate strongly correlated with cellular activities and achieved a maximum conversion of 98% within 48 hours. Living cells efflux redox power across membranes through metabolism and that terminal electron fluxes are captured by zwitterionic methacrylates pre&#8208;assembled on the living cell surface to initiate radical polymerization reactions. The polymerization caused significant changes to the cell membrane surface and synthesized hydrogels with tailored mechanical properties. The polymer hydrogel obtained via probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 was able to release the in&#8208;situ encapsulated molecules, which demonstrated living cell&#8208;mediated polymer hydrogel as a vehicle for the delivery of both cellular and molecular therapeutic agents. This research offered a green and efficient method for synthesizing bioactive materials and advancing the field of cellular therapeutics and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of Synergistic Two&#8208;Color Covalent Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of highly wavelength resolved reactivity information for complex photochemical reaction processes allows the establishment of multi&#8208;color reaction modes. One particularly powerful mode is the synergistic two&#8208;color reaction, where two colors of light have to be present in the same volume element to either enable or enhance photochemical reactivity that leads to a specific photoproduct. Herein, we introduce a two&#8208;color synergistic photochemical reaction system based on a diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) photoswitch and the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of a bridged ring&#8208;strained azobenzene (SA), which respond to ultraviolet (365 nm) and visible light (430 nm), respectively, with different rates, forming a well&#8208;defined heterocyclic photoadduct, DIOSA, that we structurally confirm via single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). To quantitatively capture the effectiveness of the dual&#8208;color irradiation as a function of the reaction conditions such as light intensity and starting material ratio as a function of product yield, we introduce a parameter, the photochemical synergistic ratio. A reduced synergistic ratio&#160;&#8211; that extrapolates to conditions of infinitesimal conversions &#8211; allows to compare the efficiency of the synergistic photochemistry at varying reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Site&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Native Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrates constitute the largest source of biomass on Earth, but their synthetic modification is highly challenging due to their high content of oxygen functionalities. The site&#8208; and stereoselective modification of native sugars is a definitive goal of glycochemistry research. Recent efforts to bypass the need for protecting groups, leveraging selective activation through photochemical mechanisms for site&#8208;selective C&#8208;C bond formation from native sugars, are likely to largely impact all glycochemistry&#8208;related areas. Davis, Koh, and co&#8208;workers have recently presented their use of photocatalysis to develop a &#8220;cap and glycosylate&#8221; approach for the site&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation of native sugars. The modernization of a direct radical functionalization of in situ formed thioglycoside using photocatalysis was used in the synthetic manipulation of unprotected carbohydrates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates constitute the largest source of biomass on Earth, but their synthetic modification is highly challenging due to their high content of oxygen functionalities. The site- and stereoselective modification of native sugars is a definitive goal of glycochemistry research. Recent efforts to bypass the need for protecting groups, leveraging selective activation through photochemical mechanisms for site-selective C-C bond formation from native sugars, are likely to largely impact all glycochemistry-related areas. Davis, Koh, and co-workers have recently presented their use of photocatalysis to develop a &#8220;cap and glycosylate&#8221; approach for the site- and stereoselective C-glycosylation of native sugars. The modernization of a direct radical functionalization of in situ formed thioglycoside using photocatalysis was used in the synthetic manipulation of unprotected carbohydrates. This allowed reaching complex saccharides, and post-translational modification of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Rocaglaol, a representative flavagline, has attracted significant attention because of its unique chemical structure and biological activities. This paper reports a mild and scalable copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. This method allows for the concise synthesis of all possible stereoisomers of a key intermediate of rocaglaol and its derivatives in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective manner using different chiral phosphine ligands. Theoretical insights into the reaction mechanism and the origin of ligand&#8208;dependent diastereodivergence were obtained using density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Adaptation of Active Site Driven by Dual&#8208;side Adsorption in Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom iron embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) is among the most representative single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite the simplicity of the active site, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO mechanism on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C remains controversial. Firstly, there is a long debate regarding the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the reactions. Secondly, recent computational and experimental studies are puzzled by the fact that the CO&#8208;poisoned Fe centers still remain highly active at high potentials. Thirdly, there are ongoing challenges in elucidating the high selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over CO2RR at high potentials. In this work, we introduce a novel CO2RR mechanism on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, which was inspired by the dynamic of active sites in biological systems. By employing grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory and kinetic Monte&#8208;Carlo, we found that the RDS is not fixed but changes with the applied potential. We demonstrated that our proposed dual&#8208;side mechanisms could clarify the reason behind the high catalytic activity of CO&#8208;poisoned metal centers, as well as the high selectivity of HER over CO2RR at high potential. This study provides a fundamental explanation for long&#8208;standing puzzles of an important catalyst and calls for the importance of considering the dynamic of active sites in reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilisation of Bromenium Ions in Macrocyclic Halogen Bond Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halenium ions (X+) are highly reactive electron deficient species that are prevalent transient intermediates in halogenation reactions. The stabilisation of these species is especially challenging, with the most common approach to sequester reactivity through the formation of bis&#8208;pyridine (Py) complexes; [(Py)2X]+. Herein, we present the first example of a macrocyclic stabilisation effect for halenium species. Exploiting a series of bis&#8208;pyridine macrocycles, we demonstrate the first example of utilising the macrocyclic ligands to stabilise halenium species via the endotopic complexation of a bromenium cation, impressively facilitating the isolation of a bench stable &#8216;Br+ NO3&#8208;&#8217; species. Solid state X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural comparison of macrocyclic Br(I) complexes with Ag(I) and Au(I) analogues provides insightful information concerning similarities and stark contrasts in halenium/metal cation coordination behaviors. Furthermore, the first chemical ligand exchange reactions of Br(I) complexes are reported between acyclic [(Py)2Br]+ species and a bis&#8208;pyridine macrocyclic donor ligand which importantly highlights a macrocycle effect for halenium cation stabilisation in the solution phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Unlocking Reactivity of Fragments for Fast Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating photochemistry within kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) techniques, we significantly accelerated the identification of enzyme inhibitors, demonstrating the potential of KTGS for rapid discovery of bioactive ligands in medicinal chemistry. The chiral linkage gives rise to the formation of enantiomers, which were assessed via a highly stereocontrolled synthesis of both templated ligand enantiomers.







Abstract
We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo&#8208;KTGS reactions.

         <title>Enhancing Anion&#8208;Selective Catalysis for Stable Lithium Metal Pouch Cells through Charge Separated COF Interlayer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy for Li metal anode is reported by charge&#8208;separated TP&#8208;COF. The strong adsorption between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries were achieved under realistic conditions.







Abstract
Regulating the composition of solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) is the key to construct high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries. Here we report a selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy to achieve a lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich SEI for stable lithium metal batteries. To accomplish this, the tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) amine&#8208;pyromeletic dianhydride covalent organic frameworks (TP&#8208;COF) was adopted as an interlayer on lithium metal anode. The strong donor&#8208;acceptor unit structure of TP&#8208;COF induces local charge separation, resulting in electron depletion and thus boosting its affinity to FSI&#8722;. The strong interaction between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. This feature facilitates rapid Li+ transfer and suppresses dendritic Li growth. Notably, we demonstrate a 6.5&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|TP&#8208;COF@Li pouch cell with high energy density (473.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (97.4&#8201;%, 95&#8197;cycles) under lean electrolyte 1.39&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, high areal capacity 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high current density 2.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our selective catalysis strategy opens a promising avenue toward the practical applications of high energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;based Electrolytes with Controllable Hydrogen Bonding Networks for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A HOF&#8208;based novel solid&#8208;state electrolyte was constructed by taking advantage of the abundant multisite hydrogen bonding and stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in HOF&#8208;DAT. Benefiting from the abundant C=O groups in the HOF backbone as ion hopping sites and the flexible hydrogen bonding skeleton of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, a fast Li+ ion conductivity (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V were achieved.







Abstract
The lack of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and the rational design of electrode/electrolyte interfaces remains challenging for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) battery is developed based on the Li&#8208;ion&#8208;conducted hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (LHOF) electrolyte and the HOF&#8208;DAT@CNT composite cathode. Benefiting from the abundant dynamic hydrogen bonding network in the backbone of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, fast Li+ ion transport (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V are achieved. Symmetric batteries constructed with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs exhibit a stably cycled duration of over 1400&#8197;h with uniform deposition, which mainly stems from the jumping sites that promote a uniformly high rate of Li+ flux and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network structure that can relieve the structural changes during Li+ transport. LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs&#8208;based Li&#8722;O2 batteries exhibit high specific capacity (10335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable cycling life up to 150 cycles. Moreover, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs endow good rate capability (129.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (210 cycles). The design of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs opens an avenue for the development of novel SSEs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Oxidation of Ammonia Catalyzed by a Molecular Iron Complex: Translating Chemical Catalysis to Mediated Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of using a molecular mediator in the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to N2 is reported. An iron electrocatalyst bearing a macrocyclic ligand with four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors functions at low temperatures (&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C) and retains high reactivity even at extremely low loadings (approximately 0.043&#8197;mM; 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of the Fe catalyst.







Abstract
Ammonia is a promising candidate in the quest for sustainable, clean energy. With its capacity to serve as an energy carrier, the oxidation of ammonia opens avenues for carbon&#8208;neutral approaches to address worldwide growing energy needs. We report the catalytic chemical oxidation of ammonia by an Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complex, trans&#8208;[LFeII(MeCN)2][PF6]2, where L is a macrocyclic ligand bearing four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors. Using triarylaminium radical cations in MeCN, up to 182 turnovers of N2 per Fe were obtained from chemical catalysis with an extremely low loading of the Fe catalyst (0.043&#8197;mM, 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst). This chemical catalysis was successfully transitioned to mediated electrocatalysis for the oxidation of ammonia. Molecular electrocatalysis by the Fe catalyst and the mediator (p&#8208;MeOC6H4)3N exhibited a catalytic half&#8208;wave potential (Ecat/2) of 0.18&#8197;V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 in MeCN, and achieved 9.3 turnovers of N2 at an applied potential of 0.20&#8197;V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in controlled&#8208;potential electrolysis, with a Faradaic efficiency of 75&#8201;%. Based on computational results, the catalyst undergoes sequential oxidation and deprotonation steps to form [LFeIV(NH2)2]2+, and thereafter bimetallic coupling to form an N&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Stable Lithium Oxygen Batteries Enabled by Solvent&#8208;diluent Interaction in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally selected methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3) diluent is introduced into the N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The interaction between the DMA solvent and M3 diluent increases the coordination number of Li+&#8208;anions, facilitating the formation of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase to improve the Li metal stability and consequently realizing stable and high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries.







Abstract
In the pursuit of next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;O2 batteries, it is imperative to develop an electrolyte with stability against the strong oxidation environments. N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) is a recognized solvent known for its robust resistance to the highly reactive reduced oxygen species, yet its application in Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been constrained due to its poor compatibility with the Li metal anode. In this study, a rationally selected hydrofluoroether diluent, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3), has been introduced into the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The stable &#8722;CH3 and C&#8722;F bonds within the M3 structure could not only augment the fundamental properties of the electrolyte but also fortify its resilience against attacks from O2&#8722; and 1O2. Additionally, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;F) presented in the M3 diluent could facilitate coordination with the electron&#8208;donating groups (&#8722;CH3) in the DMA solvent. This intermolecular interaction promotes more alignments of Li+&#8208;anions with a small amount of M3 addition, leading to the construction of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI that enhances the stability of the Li anode. As a result, the Li&#8722;O2 batteries with the DMA/M3 electrolyte exhibit superior cycling performance at both 30&#8201;&#176;C (359th) and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C (120th).

         <title>Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative construction of triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks was achieved from quinolines via nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated photocycloaddition in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. The borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state. Based on mechanistic analysis, further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene are also developed.







Abstract
Dearomative construction of multiply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks, composed of aromatic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rings and saturated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) rings, from readily available quinolines has greatly contributed to drug discovery. However, dearomative cycloadditions of quinolines in the presence of photocatalysts usually afford 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)&#8208;based polycycles, and dearomative access to 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based structures remains limited. Herein, we present a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective dearomative transformation of quinolines into 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based 6&#8211;6&#8211;4&#8208;membered rings without any catalyst, through a combination of nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the photoexcited borate complex, generated from quinoline, organolithium, and HB(pin), accelerates the cycloaddition and suppresses the rearomatization that usually occurs in conventional photocycloaddition. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we also developed further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene.

&lt;p&gt;Dearomative construction of triply-fused 2D/3D frameworks was achieved from quinolines via nucleophilic addition and borate-mediated photocycloaddition in a chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective manner. The borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state. Based on mechanistic analysis, further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene are also developed.

         <title>Benign and Selective Amination of Lignins towards Aromatic Biobased Building Blocks with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research article presents two new benign methodologies to access reactive and soluble lignin&#8208;based polyamines. The aminated lignin products have potential as renewable building blocks in aromatic polymeric materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents, for instance.







Abstract
Lignin is a widely available second&#8208;generation biopolymer and the main potential source of renewable aromatic building blocks. Lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential in applications based on chemical and materials sciences. However, common aminations techniques for lignin usually involve toxic chemicals and generate hindered and low reactivity amines.
In this study, we developed two new, simple, and benign 2&#8208;step methodologies for the elaboration of lignin&#8208;based polyamines from different technical lignins (kraft, soda and organosolv) with a selectivity towards reactive primary amines. These methods involve grafting amide groups onto lignin followed by a hydrolysis step. Non&#8208;toxic heterocyclic compounds N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline were used as amidation agents. Hydrolysis was performed in acetone&#8208;water mixtures. Reactions were studied on model compounds and optimized on lignins. Aminated lignins were fully characterized and primary amines were quantified using quantitative 19F&#8197;NMR.
Our methods generated aminated lignins with low apparent molar masses and high solubility in water and solvents. Nitrogen contents of the products ranged between 2.0 and 3.5&#8197;mmol/g with reactive primary amines counts up to 1.7&#8197;mmol/g. These soluble and reactive lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential as a replacement for fossil&#8208;based polyamines in e.g., the synthesis of aromatic polymer materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents.

         <title>Manipulating Atomic&#8208;Coupling in Dual&#8208;Cavity Boride Nanoreactor to Achieve Hierarchical Catalytic Engineering for Sulfur Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique cascaded dual&#8208;cavity boride nanoreactor is rationally designed as a sulfur host, which achieves controlled catalysis in the heterogeneous catalytic system of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The coupling between atoms regulates catalyst activity and suppresses Li2S passivation. The mechanism and application investigation of nanoreactor provides a guiding strategy for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic process of Li2S formation is considered a key pathway to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Due to the system&#8216;s complexity, the catalytic behavior is uncertain, posing significant challenges for predicting activity. Herein, we report a novel cascaded dual&#8208;cavity nanoreactor (NiCo&#8722;B) by controlling reaction kinetics, providing an opportunity for achieving hierarchical catalytic behavior. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, the multilevel structure can effectively suppress polysulfides dissolution and accelerate sulfur conversion. Furthermore, we differentiate the adsorption (B&#8722;S) and catalytic effect (Co&#8722;S) in NiCo&#8722;B, avoiding catalyst deactivation caused by excessive adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared battery displays high reversible capacity, even with sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (E/S=4&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mg&#8722;1), the areal capacity can reach 18.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Steam&#8208;Assisted Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol over Ru&#8722;In Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/In2O3&#8208;ZrO2 was found to be active for ethanol production from CO2 hydrogenation, but ethanol productivity decreased substantially after several hours of reaction due to the excessive reduction of In species. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites were stabilized, and ethanol could be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO).







Abstract
Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to synergistically combine reaction intermediates at interfacial active sites, but restructuring makes systematic control and understanding of such dynamics challenging. We here unveil how reducibility and mobility of indium oxide species in Ru&#8208;based catalysts crucially control the direct, selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol. When uncontrolled, reduced indium oxide species occupy the Ru surface, leading to deactivation. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites are stabilized, and ethanol can be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO). Our work highlights how engineering of bifunctional active ensembles enables cooperativity and synergy at tailored interfaces, which unlocks unprecedented performance in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>The Role of Phosphorus on Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis for Ruthenium Phosphides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline HOR performance of ruthenium&#8208;based phosphides were explored to investigate the catalytic role of phosphorus. P&#8208;species induced orbital overlap and d&#8208;band structure regulation would optimally enhance the hydroxyl binding energy under moderate P&#8208;content, which increase the proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water with improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond network and subsequently boost the HOR kinetics.







Abstract
Transition metal/p&#8208;block compounds are regarded as the most essential materials for electrochemical energy converting systems involving various electrocatalysis. Understanding the role of p&#8208;block element on the interaction of key intermediates and interfacial water molecule orientation at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface during the electrocatalysis is important for rational designing advanced p&#8208;block modified metal electrocatalysts. Herein, taking a sequence of ruthenium phosphides (including Ru2P, RuP and RuP2) as model catalysts, we establish a volcanic&#8208;relation between P&#8208;proportion and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity. The dominant role of P for regulating hydroxyl binding energy is validated by active sites poisoning experiments, pH&#8208;dependent infection&#8208;point behavior, in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, in which P could tailor the d&#8208;band structure of Ru, optimize the hydroxyl adsorption sites across the Ru&#8722;P moieties, thereby leading to improved proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and facilitated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, which are responsible for the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.

         <title>DNA Logical Computing on a Transistor for Cancer Molecular Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>

A transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing platform that is capable of simultaneously detecting multiple microRNAs and rapidly providing diagnostic results through built&#8208;in logic computing. The platform enables both accurate and efficient diagnosis of cancers, showing great potential in precision medicine and personalized therapy.







Abstract
Given the high degree of variability and complexity of cancer, precise monitoring and logical analysis of different nucleic acid markers are crucial for improving diagnostic precision and patient survival rates. However, existing molecular diagnostic methods normally suffer from high cost, cumbersome procedures, dependence on specialized equipment and the requirement of in&#8208;depth expertise in data analysis, failing to analyze multiple cancer&#8208;associated nucleic acid markers and provide immediate results in a point&#8208;of&#8208;care manner. Herein, we demonstrate a transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing (TDMC) platform that enables simultaneous detection and logical analysis of multiple microRNA (miRNA) markers on a single transistor. TDMC can perform not only basic logical operations such as &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;, but also complex cascading computing, opening up new dimensions for multi&#8208;index logical analysis. Owing to the high efficiency, sensing and computations of multi&#8208;analytes can be operated on a transistor at a concentration as low as 2&#215;10&#8722;16 M, reaching the lowest concentration for DNA molecular computing. Thus, TDMC achieves an accuracy of 98.4&#8201;% in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from 62 serum samples. As a convenient and accurate platform, TDMC holds promise for applications in &#8220;one&#8208;stop&#8221; personalized medicine.

         <title>Enabling Efficient Anchoring&#8208;Conversion Interface by Fabricating Double&#8208;Layer Functionalized Separator for Suppressing Shuttle Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, where Co/CoN4 layer serves as adsorption&#8208;catalytic centers for high&#8208;order and low&#8208;order LiPSs, combined with 2D MXene layer that acts as the second barrier for additional leaked LiPSs, and thus a circulation interface of adsorption&#8208;conversion&#8208;reactivation of S species has been realized, effectively alleviating the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur/selenium batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LiSBs) with high energy density still face challenges on sluggish conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and low blocking feature of ordinary separators to LiPSs. To tackle these, a novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, which consists of Co with atomically dispersed CoN4 decorated on Ketjen black (Co/CoN4@KB) layer and an ultrathin 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene layer. The theoretical calculations and experimental results jointly demonstrate metallic Co sites provide efficient adsorption and catalytic capability for long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while CoN4 active sites facilitate the absorption of short&#8208;chain LiPSs and promote the conversion to Li2S. The stacking MXene layer serves as a microscopic barrier to further physically block and chemically anchor the leaked LiPSs from the pores and gaps of the Co/CoN4@KB layer, thus preserving LiPSs within efficient anchoring&#8208;conversion reaction interfaces to balance the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8197;S&#8221; and Li2S. Consequently, with an ultralight loading of Co/CoN4@KB&#8208;MXene, the LiSBs exhibit amazing electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte, and the outperforming performance for lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (LiSeBs) can also be achieved. This work exploits a universal and effective strategy of a double&#8208;layer functionalized separator to regulate the equilibrium adsorption&#8208;catalytic interface, enabling high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycle LiSBs/LiSeBs.

         <title>Development of a Fluorescent Probe with High Selectivity based on Thiol&#8208;ene Click Nucleophilic Cascade Reactions for Delving into the Action Mechanism of Serotonin in Depression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to achieve rapid and accurate detection of serotonin in organisms is a key question in studying the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as depression. To study the action mechanism of serotonin, we have developed a highly selective molecular probe based on thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions that enables real&#8208;time imaging of brain tissues in depression.







Abstract
The intrinsic correlation between depression and serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a highly debated topic, with significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and advancement of drugs targeting neurological disorders. To address this important question, it is of utmost priority to understand the action mechanism of serotonin in depression through fluorescence imaging studies. However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe SJ&#8208;5&#8208;HT for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin). These discoveries could offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning depression and furnish mTOR as a novel direction for the advancement of antidepressant therapies.

Abstract
2&#8208;Bromo&#8208;1&#8208;(3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one (RRx&#8208;001) is a hypoxic cell chemotherapeutics with already demonstrated synergism in combined chemo&#8208;radiation therapy. The interaction of the compound with secondary low&#8208;energy electrons formed in large amounts during the physico&#8208;chemical phase of the irradiation may lead to these synergistic effects. The present study focuses on the first step of RRx&#8208;001 interaction with low&#8208;energy electrons in which a transient anion is formed and fragmented. Combination of two experiments allows us to disentangle the decay of the RRx&#8208;001 anion on different timescales. Sole presence of the electron initiates rapid dissociation of NO2 and HNO2 neutrals while NO2&#8722; and Br&#8722; anions are produced both directly and via intermediate complexes. Based on our quantum chemical calculations, we propose that bidirectional state switching between &#960;*(NO2) and &#963;*(C&#8722;Br) states explains the experimental spectra. The fast dynamics monitored will impact the condensed phase chemistry of the anion as well.

         <title>Fluorinated Dialkyl Chloronium Salts: Synthesis and Reactivity for Fluoroalkylation and Hydride Abstraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis of highly electrophilic fluorinated dialkyl chloronium salts [Cl(CH2CF3)2][M(OTeF5)n] (M=Sb, n=6; M=Al, n=4), which are able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, while their high hydride ion affinity enables the activation of linear alkanes leading to the formation of branched carbocations.







Abstract
A new concept for the synthesis of dialkyl chloronium cations [R&#8722;Cl&#8722;R]+ is described (R=CH3, CH2CF3), that allows the formation of fluorinated derivatives. By utilizing the xenonium salt [XeOTeF5][M(OTeF5)n] (M=Sb, n=6; M=Al, n=4) chlorine atoms of chloroalkanes or the deactivated chlorofluoroalkane CH2ClCF3 are oxidized and removed as ClOTeF5 leading to the isolation of the corresponding chloronium salt. Since the resulting highly electrophilic cation [Cl(CH2CF3)2]+ is able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, this compound can be utilized for the introduction of a fluorinated alkyl group to those. In addition, the fluorinated alkyl chloronium cation displays a high hydride ion affinity, enabling the activation of linear hydrocarbons by hydride abstraction even at low temperatures ultimately leading to the formation of branched carbocations.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Cu Penetration Electrode Boosts Asymmetric C&#8722;C Coupling for Ampere&#8208;Level CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Reduction in Acid</title>

Tensile&#8208;strained copper hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (Cu HPE) enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of multicarbon (C2+) products. A faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic electrolyte (pH=1).







Abstract
The synthesis of multicarbon (C2+) products remains a substantial challenge in sustainable CO2 electroreduction owing to the need for sufficient current density and faradaic efficiency alongside carbon efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate ampere&#8208;level high&#8208;efficiency CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in both neutral and strongly acidic (pH=1) electrolytes using a hierarchical Cu hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE). High concentration of K+ could concurrently suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+ production in strong acid. By optimizing the K+ and H+ concentration and CO2 flow rate, a faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic solution of H2SO4 and KCl (pH=1). Experimental measurements and density functional theory simulations suggested that tensile&#8208;strained Cu HPE enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of C2+ products.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dual Reaction Strategy for Highly Reversible Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin layered solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is in situ constructed by dual reaction strategy, which synergistically utilizes spontaneous electrostatic reaction and electrochemical decomposition via introducing the functional additive CMIM (1&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). CMIM&#8242;s unique molecular structure also enables the disruption of hydrogen bonding, guides uniform Zn2+ deposition, and promotes rapid ion transfer to enhance battery stability, thus affording highly reversible queous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
In situ construction of solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) is an effective strategy to enhance the reversibility of zinc (Zn) anodes. However, in situ SEI to afford high reversibility under high current density conditions (&#8805;20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is highly desired yet extremely challenging. Herein, we propose a dual reaction strategy of spontaneous electrostatic reaction and electrochemical decomposition for the in situ construction of SEI, which is composed of organic&#8208;rich upper layer and inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer. Particularly, in situ SEI performs as &#8220;growth binder&#8220; at small current density and &#8220;orientation regulator&#8221; at high current density, which significantly suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth. The in situ SEI affords the record&#8208;breaking reversibility of Zn anode under practical conditions, Zn//Zn symmetric cells can stably cycle for over 1300&#8197;h and 400&#8197;h at current densities of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, showcasing an exceptional cumulative capacity of 67.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the practicality of this in situ SEI is verified in Zn//PANI pouch cells with high mass loading of 25.48&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a universal strategy to design advanced SEI for practical Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Photocatalytic Multisite Functionalization of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes by Merging Polar Cycloaddition and Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is established by merging dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This transformation was triggered by XAT followed by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;HAT and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer. With this method, a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.







Abstract
Although highly appealing for rapid access of molecular complexity, multi&#8208;functionalization of alkenes that allows incorporation of more than two functional groups remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy that merges dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, thus enabling a smooth 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes. A highly regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition anchors a reaction trigger onto alkene substrates. The subsequent halogen atom transfer (XAT) selectively initiates ring&#8208;opening process, which is followed by a series of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer (FAT) events. With this method, site&#8208;selective introduction of three different functional groups is accomplished and a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.

         <title>From Ultrafast Photoinduced Small Polarons to Cooperative and Macroscopic Charge&#8208;Transfer Phase Transition</title>

Femtosecond infrared spectroscopy is used to study the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamics of the ultrafast and persistent photoinduced phase transition of the Rb0.94Mn0.94Co0.06[Fe(CN)6]0.98&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.2H2O material, induced at room temperature. The data show that optical excitation creates small CT polarons within 250&#8197;fs. Above threshold excitation, a cooperative and macroscopic phase transition occurs on the 100&#8197;ps timescale.







Abstract
We study by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy the ultrafast and persistent photoinduced phase transition of the Rb0.94Mn0.94Co0.06[Fe(CN)6]0.98&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.2H2O material, induced at room temperature by a single laser shot. This system exhibits a charge&#8208;transfer based phase transition with a 75&#8197;K wide thermal hysteresis, centred at room temperature, from the low temperature Mn3+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ tetragonal phase to the high temperature Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+ cubic phase. At room temperature, the photoinduced phase transition is persistent. However, the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamics leading to this phase is multi&#8208;scale. Femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, particularly sensitive to local reorganizations through the evolution of the frequency of the N&#8722;C vibration modes with the different characteristic electronic states, reveals that at low laser fluence and on short time scale, the photoexcitation of the Mn3+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ phase creates small charge&#8208;transfer polarons [Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+]* within &#8771;250&#8197;fs. The local trapping of photoinduced intermetallic charge&#8208;transfer is characterized by the appearance of a polaronic infrared band, due to the surrounding Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ species. Above a threshold fluence, when a critical fraction of small CT&#8208;polarons is reached, the macroscopic phase transition to the persistent Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+ cubic phase occurs within &#8771; 100&#8197;ps. This non&#8208;linear photo&#8208;response results from elastic cooperativity, intrinsic to a switchable lattice and reminiscent of a feedback mechanism.

         <title>Solvent Minimized Synthesis of Amides by Reactive Extrusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct amidation of esters is converted from a ball&#8208;milled process into a continuous solvent&#8208;minimised reactive extrusion protocol capable of delivering 500&#8197;grams (1.3&#8197;mols) of amide product over a continuous operation for 7&#8197;hours. Key to this, was translation of heating profiles used for the ball&#8208;milling study directly to the extruder and consideration of the physical form of input substrates.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the translation of a small scale ball&#8208;milled amidation protocol into a large scale continuous reactive extrusion process. Critical components to the successful translation were: a) understanding how the different operating parameters of a twin&#8208;screw extruder should be harnessed to control prolonged continuous operation, and b) consideration of the physical form of the input materials. The amidation reaction is applied to 36 amides spanning a variety of physical form combinations (liquid&#8208;liquid, solid&#8211;liquid and solid&#8208;solid). Following this learning process, we have developed an understanding for the translation of each physical form combination and demonstrated a 7&#8208;hour reactive extrusion process for the synthesis of an amide on 500&#8197;gram scale (1.3&#8197;mols of product).

         <title>A Chemoselective Enrichment Strategy for In&#8208;Depth Coverage of the Methyllysine Proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate lysine methylation comprehensively, a robust method for Kme1 enrichment was established. Dimethoxyaryl diazonium crosslinked Kme1 with high reactivity and selectivity among tryptic peptides from cell samples. As a result, over 10000&#8197;Kme1 sites were identified by proteomic analysis. Furthermore, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments.







Abstract
Proteomics is a powerful method to comprehensively understand cellular posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Owing to low abundance, tryptic peptides with PTMs are usually enriched for enhanced coverage by liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS/MS). Affinity chromatography for phosphoproteomes by metal&#8208;oxide and pan&#8208;specific antibodies for lysine acetylome allow identification of tens of thousands of modification sites. Lysine methylation is a significant PTM; however, only hundreds of methylation sites were identified by available approaches. Herein we report an aryl diazonium based chemoselective strategy that enables enrichment of monomethyllysine (Kme1) peptides through covalent bonds with extraordinary sensitivity. We identified more than 10000 Kme1 peptides from diverse cell lines and mouse tissues, which implied a wide lysine methylation impact on cellular processes. Furthermore, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments.

         <title>Targeting Mitochondrial Guanine Quadruplexes for Photoactivatable Chemotherapy in Hypoxic Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an oxygen independent photoactivatable chemotherapeutic, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3, that targets mitochondrial guanine quadruplexes. Photoirradiation induces depletion of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial dysfunction causing cell death by triggering apoptosis. Importantly, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 is negligibly toxic under dark conditions but upon irradiation, significant toxicity is observed.







Abstract
A first example of a mitochondrial G&#8208;quadruplex (mitoG4s) targeted Ru(II) photooxidant complex is reported. The complex, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 induces photodamage toward guanine quadruplexes (G4s) located in the mitochondrial genome under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 shows high affinity for mitoG4s and localises within mitochondria of live HeLa cells. Immunolabelling with anti&#8208;G4 antibody, BG4, confirms Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 associates with G4s within the mitochondria of fixed cells. The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5&#8197;J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type&#8197;II singlet oxygen and Type&#8197;III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions, from live cell assays and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural biomaterials such as spider silk and mussel byssi are fabricated by the chemoresponsive phase separation of biomacromolecules. Inspired by these biofabrication schemes, this work demonstrates that ion&#8208;specific interactions between cationic polyelectrolytes and ionic cosolutes offers new opportunities to control the assembly, structure, and dynamic physical properties of soft matter.







Abstract
Biomaterials such as spider silk and mussel byssi are fabricated by the dynamic manipulation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular biopolymer interactions. Organisms modulate solution parameters, such as pH and ion co&#8208;solute concentration, to effect these processes. These biofabrication schemes provide a conceptual framework to develop new dynamic and responsive abiotic soft material systems. Towards these ends, the chemical diversity of readily available ionic compounds offers a broad palette to manipulate the physicochemical properties of polyelectrolytes via ion&#8208;specific interactions. In this study, we show for the first time that the ion&#8208;specific interactions of biomimetic polyelectrolytes engenders a variety of phase separation behaviors, creating dynamic thermal&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive soft matter that exhibits a spectrum of physical properties, spanning viscous fluids to viscoelastic and viscoplastic solids. These ion&#8208;dependent characteristics are further rendered general by the merger of lysine and phenylalanine into a single, amphiphilic vinyl monomer. The unprecedented breadth, precision, and dynamicity in the reported ion&#8208;dependent phase behaviors thus introduce a broad array of opportunities for the future development of responsive soft matter; properties that are poised to drive developments in critical areas such as chemical sensing, soft robotics, and additive manufacturing.

         <title>Butadiene Sulfone Based Binary Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>

A nonflammable binary DEE electrolyte comprising of LiTFSI and solid BdS is reported, which demonstrates enhanced Li metal compatibility while exhibiting high Li+ ion migration number, ionic conductivity, and wide electrochemical window for Li metal battery applications.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) have attracted significant interest due to the unique physiochemical properties, yet challenges persist in achieving satisfactory Li anode compatibility through a binary DEE formula. In this study, we introduce a nonflammable binary DEE electrolyte comprising of lithium bis(trifluoro&#8208;methane&#8208;sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and solid butadiene sulfone (BdS), which demonstrates enhanced Li metal compatibility while exhibiting high Li+ ion migration number (0.52), ionic conductivity (1.48&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1), wide electrochemical window (~4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) at room temperature. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the Li compatibility derives from the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich SEI, attributed to the undesirable adsorption and deformation of BdS on Li surface that facilitates the preferential reactions between LiTFSI and Li metal. This stable SEI effectively suppresses dendrites growth and gas evolution reactions, ensuring a long lifespan and high coulombic efficiency in both the Li||Li symmetric cells, Li||LiCoO2 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells. Moreover, the BdS eutectic strategy exhibit universal applicability to other metal such as Na and Zn by pairing with the corresponding TFSI&#8208;based salts.

         <title>First Main&#8208;Group Element Lewis Acid Thionyl Chloride Adduct and its Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of adducts of tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallium and &#8208;indium, M(C2F5)3 (M=Ga, In) with weak donor molecules, particularly of the first structurally characterized thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid. [Ga(C2F5)3(SOCl2)] is accessible by dehydration of [Ga(C2F5)3(OH2)2] with thionyl chloride.







Abstract
Although the adduct of aluminum trichloride with thionyl chloride has been reported, no thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid or organometallic compound has been structurally characterized. In this communication we present the synthesis and reactivity of the structurally ascertained adduct of thionyl chloride with tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallane as a representative of a main group element Lewis acid. Gallium and indium compounds with electron withdrawing groups, e.g. the pentafluoroethyl ligand, display versatile properties. While gallates and indates, [MR4]&#8722;, behave as weakly coordinating anions, neutral gallanes and indanes, MR3, are strong Lewis acids. Salts with the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate and &#8208;indate, [M(C2F5)4]&#8722; (M=Ga, In), have recently been studied in detail. In contrast to this, work on the syntheses of the free Lewis superacids M(C2F5)3 (M=Ga, In) is scarce and underdeveloped. The hydrates [M(C2F5)3(OH2)2] proved to be suitable starting materials, particularly due to their thermal stability. Herein we report on synthesis and characterization of reactive adducts, [M(C2F5)3D], with the weak donor molecules (D) SOCl2 and Me3SiF. The effective Lewis acidities of Ga(C2F5)3 and In(C2F5)3 were experimentally determined by the (modified) Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and their catalytic potential is showcased.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Triggered H&#8208;Abstraction Photoinitiators for the Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Independent Therapy of Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer photodynamic therapy. The photoinitiator can initiate red&#8208;light&#8208;induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules to induce necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, photoinitiator was degraded following H&#8208;abstraction, avoiding the long&#8208;term phototoxicity. This study provides a crucial molecular strategy for hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
The clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by oxygen&#8208;dependence and side effects caused by photosensitizer residues. Photoinitiators based on the H&#8208;abstraction reaction can address these challenges because they can generate alkyl radical&#8208;killing cells independently of oxygen and undergo rapid bleaching following H&#8208;abstraction. Nonetheless, the development of photoinitiators for PDT has been impeded by the absence of effective design strategies. Herein, we have developed aryl&#8208;ketone substituted cyanine (ACy&#8722;R), the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer therapy. These ACy&#8722;R molecules inherited the near&#8208;infrared absorption of cyanine dye, and aryl&#8208;ketone modification imparted H&#8208;abstraction capability. Experimental and quantum calculations revealed that modifying the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of the aryl (e.g., ACy&#8208;5F) improved the contribution of the O atom to the photon excitation process promoting intersystem crossing and H&#8208;abstraction ability. Particularly, ACy&#8208;5F rapidly penetrated cells and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum. Even under severe hypoxia, ACy&#8208;5F initiated red&#8208;light induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules, inducing necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, ACy&#8208;5F was degraded after H&#8208;abstraction, thus avoiding the side effects of long&#8208;term phototoxicity after therapy. This study not only provides a crucial molecular tool for hypoxic tumors therapy, but also presents a promising strategy for the development of multifunctional photosensitizers and photoinitiators.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fully conjugated sp2&#8208;c covalent organic framework integrated with multipolar structures and enrichment sites have been prepared for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Benefiting from optimal multipolar structures and functional sites, TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH facilitated charge transfer and mass movement during the photocatalysis process, leading to highly efficient ORR performance with a H2O2 production rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The direct production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through photocatalytic reaction via H2O and O2 is considered as an ideal approach. However, the efficiency of H2O2 generation is generally limited by insufficient charge and mass transfer. Covalent organic framework (COFs) offer a promising platform as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for H2O2 production due to their potential for rational design at the molecular level. Herein, we integrated the multipolar structures and carboxyl groups into COFs to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water without any sacrificial agents. The introduction of octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with an increase of molecular planarity, created efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Meanwhile, carboxyl groups could not only boost O2 and H2O2 movement via enhancement of pore hydrophilicity, but also promote proton conduction, enabling the conversion to H2O2 from &#8901;O2&#8722;, which is the crucial intermediate product in H2O2 photocatalysis. Overall, we demonstrate that TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH, consisting of optimal octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with enrichment sites (carboxyl groups), exhibited a H2O2 yield rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722; 1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (SCC) efficiency of 0.55&#8201;%. This work provides valuable insights for designing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 production.

         <title>The Reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 Nanorods for Efficient and pH&#8208;universal Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Te&#8722;Bi NRs were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. The obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate with high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline).







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to generate chemical fuels such as formate presents a promising route to a carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, its practical application is hindered by the competing CO production and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as the lack of pH&#8208;universal catalysts. Here, Te&#8208;modified Bi nanorods (Te&#8722;Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi2Te4O11 NRs during CO2RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi2Te4O11, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus&#8208;obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline). In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3&#8201;%, 96.4&#8201;%, and 91.0&#8201;%, respectively, at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron&#8208;deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate, and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds and In situ Photoinduced Metallic Bi0/Ni0 Accelerating Z&#8208;Scheme Charge Transfer of BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH for Highly Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme junction BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH with stable interface and abundant atomic&#8208;level charge transfer channels is fabricated. Bi0 and Ni0 in situ formed at the interface and surface of LDH separately act as electron mediator and electron extractor to facilitate the charge migration. The system exhibits a high charge transfer efficiency up to 71.2&#8201;%, nearly 10&#8208;fold than the BiOBr, optimizing the efficiency of photocatalytic activation of PMS for tetracycline degradation.







Abstract
For heterojunction system, the lack of stable interfacial driving force and definite charge transfer channel makes the charge separation and transfer efficiency unsatisfactory. The photoreaction mechanism occurring at the interface also receives less attention. Herein, a 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme junction BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH with large&#8208;area contact featured by short interface hydrogen bonds and strong interfacial electric field (IEF) is synthesized, and in situ photoinduced metallic species assisting charge transfer mechanism is demonstrated. The hydrogen bonds between O atoms from BiOBr and H atoms from NiFe&#8208;LDH induce a significant interfacial charge redistribution, establishing a robust IEF. Notably, during photocatalytic reaction, Bi0 and Ni0 are in situ performed in heterojunction, which separately act as electron transport mediator and electron trap to further accelerate charge transfer efficiency up to 71.2&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the existence of Bi0 strengthens the IEF. Therefore, high&#8208;speed spatial charge separation is realized in Bi0/BiOBr@Ni0/NiFe&#8208;LDH, leading to a prominent photocatalytic activity with a tetracycline removal ratio of 88.3&#8201;% within 7&#8197;min under visible&#8208;light irradiation and the presence of persulfate, far exceeding majority of photocatalysts reported previously. This study provides valid insights for designing hydrogen bonding heterojunction systems, and advances mechanistic understanding on in situ photoreaction at interfaces.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Nanocatalyst for Precise In&#8208;Situ Antimicrobial Synthesis via Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst MB@PMOF has been developed to facilitate in situ synthesis of antimicrobials through a photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction in bacterial infected tissue. This approach enables precise and potent treatment against severe bacterial infections, providing innovative design concepts for a new generation of alternative antibacterial therapies.







Abstract
The excessive and prolonged use of antibiotics contributes to the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant S. aureus strains and potential dysbacteriosis&#8208;related diseases, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Herein, we present a light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst for synthesizing in situ antimicrobials through photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction, achieving precise, site&#8208;directed elimination of S. aureus skin infections. Methylene blue (MB), a commercially available photosensitizer, was encapsulated within the CuII&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, MOF&#8208;199, and further enveloped with Pluronic F&#8208;127 to create the light&#8208;responsive nanocatalyst MB@PMOF. Upon exposure to red light, MB participates in a photoredox&#8208;catalytic cycle, driven by the 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic carboxylate salts (BTC&#8722;) ligand presented in the structure of MOF&#8208;199. This light&#8208;activated MB then catalyzes the reduction of CuII to CuI through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, efficiently initiating the click reaction to form active antimicrobial agents under physiological conditions. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the effectiveness of MB@PMOF&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis in inhibiting S. aureus, including their methicillin&#8208;resistant strains, thereby accelerating skin healing in severe bacterial infections. This study introduces a novel design paradigm for controlled, on&#8208;site drug synthesis, offering a promising alternative to realize precise treatment of bacterial infections without undesirable side effects.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Lewis Acid&#8722;Base Interaction Toward para&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Aldimines and Benzylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for para selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines has been developed using iridium catalysis. While aromatic aldimines participate in a sterically controlled Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction where the in situ generated pinacolborane acts as a transient directing group (DG), interestingly the origin of the para selectivity of benzylamines stems from the sterical demand of the N&#8208;substituents.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization of arenes at the para position remains extremely challenging primarily due to its relative inaccessibility from the catalytic site. As a consequence, it is significantly restricted to limited molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report a method for the para&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines using commercially available ligands under iridium catalysis. The established method displays excellent para selectivity for variously substituted aromatic aldimines, benzylamines and bioactive molecules. Based on several control experiments, it is proposed that a Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction between the nitrogen and boron functionality guides the para selectivity via a steric shield for the aromatic aldimines, where Bpin acts as a transient directing group. However, the steric shield of the in situ generated N&#8722;Bpin moiety controlled the overall selectivity for the para borylation of benzylamines.

         <title>Optimizing the Microenvironment in Solid Polymer Electrolytes by Anion Vacancy Coupled with Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D flower&#8208;like SnS2 composite with abundant sulfur vacancies is synthesized under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots, and it is employed as filler to optimize the microenvironment in solid polymer electrolytes. As a result, the constructed composite electrolyte not only exhibits high room temperature ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number but also demonstrates significantly improved mechanical properties, providing solid state lithium metal batteries with excellent cycling stability and extended cycle life.







Abstract
The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li+, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li+ in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower&#8208;like SnS2&#8208;based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS2 have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in situ formed Li2S/Li3N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li+ diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy&#8208;rich inorganic filler modification strategy.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Responsive Formation Cycling Enabling LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a novel additive&#8208;free strategy to create LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) through low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Achieving superior battery performance across a wide temperature range, this approach is applicable to various cathode systems, highlighting its versatility and potential for advancing battery technology.







Abstract
Formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase is highly desirable for wide&#8208;temperature battery, but its application is hindered by the unwanted side reactions associated with conventional method of introducing fluorinated additives. Here, we developed an additive&#8208;free strategy to produce LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) by low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Using LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 as a model cathode, the atomic ratio of LiF in the CEI formed at &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C is about 17.7&#8201;%, enhanced by ~550&#8201;% compared to CEI formed at 25&#8201;&#176;C (2.7&#8201;%). The underlying mechanism is uncovered by both experiments and theoretic simulation, indicating that the decomposition of LiPF6 to LiF is transformed into spontaneous and exothermic on positively charged cathode surface and lowering the temperature shift chemical equilibrium towards the formation of LiF&#8208;rich CEI. Superior to conventional fluorinated additives, this approach is free from unwanted side reactions, imparting batteries with both high&#8208;temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) cyclability and low&#8208;temperature rate performance (capacity enhanced by 100&#8201;% at 3&#8197;C at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). This low&#8208;temperature formation cycling to construct LiF&#8208;rich CEI is extended to various cathode systems, such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, demonstrating the versatility and potential impact of our strategy in advancing the performance and stability of wide&#8208;temperature batteries and beyond.

         <title>Lithiation Induced Hetero&#8208;Superlattice Zn/ZnLi as Stable Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi anode containing periodic arrangements of metallic Zn phase and zincophilic ZnLi phase at the nanoscale, is well designed and fabricated via electrochemical lithiation method. The HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi anode can effectively guide Zn ion stripping/deposition evenly during repeatedly stripping/plating processes. Consequently, the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi anode with hetero&#8208;superlattice structure can cycle over 2800&#8197;h without a short&#8208;circuit at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Three dimensional (3D) framework structure is one of the most effective ways to achieve uniform zinc deposition and thus inhibit the Zn dendrites growth in working Zn metallic anode. A major challenge facing for the most commonly used 3D zincophilic hosts is that the zincophilic layer tends to peel off during repeatedly cycling, making it less stable. Herein, for the first time, a hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi (HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi) anode containing periodic arrangements of metallic Zn phase and zincophilic ZnLi phase at the nanoscale, is well designed and fabricated via electrochemical lithiation method. Based on binding energy and stripping energy calculation, and the operando optical observation of plating/stripping behaviors, the zincophilic ZnLi sites with a strong Zn adsorption ability in the interior of the 3D ZnLi framework structure can effectively guide uniform Zn nucleation and dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, which significantly improves the cycling stability of the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi alloy (over 2800&#8197;h without a short&#8208;circuit at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). More importantly, this strategy can be extended to HS&#8722;Zn/ZnNa and HS&#8722;Zn/ZnK anodes that are similar to the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi microstructure, also displaying significantly enhanced cycling performances in AZIBs. This study can provide a novel strategy to develop the dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with stable cycling performance.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Enantiodivergent Construction of P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Molecules via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation of Prochiral N&#8208;Aryl Phosphonamides with Aromatic Iodides</title>

         <dc:description>
A new strategy for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules via palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis was established. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing both enantiomers of the P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules using a single chiral norbornene catalyst.







Abstract
In this work, we describe an efficient and modular method for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules by utilizing the catalytic atroposelective Catellani&#8208;type C&#8722;H arylation/desymmetric intramolecular N&#8208;arylation cascade reaction. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was proved to be tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing a wide range of both chiral P(V)&#8208;stereogenic enantiomers in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantiomeric excesses. Noteworthy is that the strategy developed herein represents an unprecedented example of solvent&#8208;dictated inversion of the enantioselectivity of P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Based Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Structures for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework denoted as 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) with fine&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor interaction is demonstrated to establish a rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport channel and induce uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The appearance of disordered lithium dendrites and fragile solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) significantly hinder the serviceability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework with partially electronegative channels (4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) is incorporated as a protective layer to modulate the interface stability of the lithium metal batteries. Notably, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF with optimized electronic structure at the molecular level by fine&#8208;tuning the local acceptor&#8208;donor functionalities not only enhances the intermolecular interaction thereby providing larger dipole moment and improved crystallinity and mechanical stress, but also facilitates the beneficial effect of lithiophilic sites (C&#8722;F bonds, triazine cores, C=N linkages and aromatic rings) to further regulate the migration of Li+ and achieve a uniform lithium deposition behavior as determined by various in&#8208;depth in/ex situ characterizations. Due to the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;component organic functionalities, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF modified full cells perform significantly better than the common two/three&#8208;component 2C&#8208;TA&#8208;CTF and 3C&#8208;TF&#8208;CTF electrodes, delivering an excellent capacity of 116.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (capacity retention ratio: 86.8&#8201;%) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C and improved rate capability. This work lays a platform for the prospective molecular design of improved organic framework relative artificial SEI for highly stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Non&#8208;Classical Deactivation Mechanism in a Supported Intermetallic Catalyst for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that deactivation of the PtZn/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst occurred due to reconstruction from PtZn IMA to Pt3Zn IMA. This deactivation mechanism differs from traditional coke deposition and sintering, as it is driven by the metal support interaction (MSI). Further investigation revealed that surface modification of alumina, such as with K ions, effectively inhibits the reconstruction of PtZn IMA, thereby enhancing the stability of propane dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based supported intermetallic alloys (IMAs) demonstrate exceptional performance in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily because of their remarkable resistance to coke formation. However, these IMAs still encounter a significant hurdle in the form of catalyst deactivation. Understanding the complex deactivation mechanism of supported IMAs, which goes beyond conventional coke deposition, requires meticulous microscopic structural elucidation. In this study, we unravel a nonclassical deactivation mechanism over a PtZn/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 PDH catalyst, dictated by the PtZn to Pt3Zn nanophase transformation accompanied with dezincification. The physical origin lies in the metal support interaction (MSI) that enables strong chemical bonding between hydroxyl groups on the support and Zn sites on the PtZn phase to selectively remove Zn species followed by the reconstruction towards Pt3Zn phase. Building on these insights, we have devised a solution to circumvent the deactivation by passivating the MSI through surface modification of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support. By exchanging protons of hydroxyl groups with potassium ions (K) on the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support, such a strategy significantly minimizes the dezincification of PtZn IMA via diminished metal&#8208;support bonding, which dramatically reduces the deactivation rate from 0.2044 to 0.0587&#8197;h&#8722;1. These findings decode the nonclassical PDH deactivation mechanism over supported IMA catalysts and elaborate a new logic for the design of high&#8208;performance IMA based PDH catalysts with long&#8208;term stability.

2&#8208;Alkenylarylimines have been shown to undergo 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization thermally to generate azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes. These o&#8208;quinodimethanes show dual nature as a cyclic diene and a benzylic diradical. The interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;quinodimethanes by H&#8208;atom transfer enabled the synthesis of five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The cyclic dienes were intercepted by [4+2] cycloaddition to generate bridgehead azabicycles.







Abstract
We demonstrate that 2&#8208;alkenylarylaldimines and ketimines undergo thermal 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization to generate a wide range of azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs). These o&#8208;QDMs exist as a hybrid of a diene and a benzylic diradical. The diradical nature was confirmed by their ability to undergo dimerization and react with H&#8208;atom donor, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and O2. In addition, the interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;QDMs by H&#8208;atom transfer was used to synthesize five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules. The diene form can undergo [4+2] cycloaddition reactions with different dienophiles to generate bridged azabicycles in high endo:exo selectivity. The azabicyclic o&#8208;QDMs can be generated for [4+2] cycloaddition from a wide range of electronically and sterically varied 2&#8208;alkenylarylimines, including mono, di, tri and tetrasubstituted alkenes, and imines derived from arylamine, alkylamine (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;), benzylamine, benzylsulfonamide and Boc&#8208;amine.

         <title>The Effects of Pore Defects in &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up synthesis strategy was used to introduce pore defects into the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;extended helicene. This modification transformed the helicene with original aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) characteristics into a series of novel helicenes with dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. Consequently, the application range of the helicene in chiral luminescent materials was expanded.







Abstract
The introduction of precise pore defects into nanocarbon structures results in the emergence of distinct physicochemical characteristics. However, there is a lack of research on non&#8208;planar chiral nanographene involving precise pore defects. Herein, we have developed two analogues to the &#960;&#8208;extended pentadecabenzo[9]helicene (EP9H) containing embedded pore defects. Each molecules, namely extended dodecabenzo[7]helicene (ED7H; 1) or extended nonabenzo[5]helicene (EN5H; 2), exhibits dual&#8208;state emission. Significantly, the value of |glum| of 1 is exceptionally high at 1.41&#215;10&#8722;2 in solution and BCPL as 254&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In PMMA film, |glum| of 1 is 8.56&#215;10&#8722;3, and in powder film, it is 5.00&#215;10&#8722;3. This study demonstrates that nanocarbon molecules with pore defects exhibit dual&#8208;state emission properties while maintaining quite good chiral luminescence properties. It was distinguished from the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect corresponding to the nanocarbon without embedded defect. Incorporating pore defects into chiral nanocarbon molecules also simplifies the synthesis process and enhances the solubility of the resulting product. These findings suggest that the introduction of pore defects can be a viable approach to improve nanocarbon molecules.

         <title>Perylene with Split&#8208;Azulene Embedding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with split azulene embedment remain experimentally rare, despite their exceptional properties. Herein, Pery&#8208;57 with split azulene is synthesized and exhibits remarkable characteristics like NIR II absorption, p&#8208;type transport, and outstanding redox features like diradical character, global antiaromaticity, hydrogen capture. This work stimulates new interest in azulene&#8208;like nonalternant PAHs.







Abstract
Splitting the five and seven&#8208;membered rings of azulene and embedding them separately into a conjugated backbone provides azulene&#8208;like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are of great interest in quantum and material chemistry. However, the synthetic accessibility poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present the synthesis of a novel azulene&#8208;like PAH, Pery&#8208;57, which can be viewed as the integration of a perylene framework into the split azulene. The compact structure of Pery&#8208;57 displays several intriguing characteristics, including NIR II absorption at 1200&#8197;nm, a substantial dipole moment of 3.5&#8197;D, and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail alternating columnar packing. Furthermore, Pery&#8208;57 exhibits remarkable redox properties. The cationic radical Pery&#8208;57&#8901;+ readily captures a hydrogen atom. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR (VT&#8197;NMR ) and variable&#8208;temperature EPR (VT&#8208;EPR) studies reveal that the dianion Pery&#8208;572&#8722; possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and demonstrates significant global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The dication Pery&#8208;572+ is also predicted to exhibit diradical character. Despite bearing three bulky substituents, Pery&#8208;57 displays p&#8208;type transport characteristics with a mobility of 0.03&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, attributed to its unique azulene&#8208;like structure. Overall, this work directs interest in azulene&#8208;like PAHs, a unique member of nonalternant PAHs showcasing exceptional properties and applications.

         <title>Boosting the Stability of Subnanometer Pt Catalysts by the Presence of Framework Indium(III) Sites in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of the subnanometer PtIn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10MR channels of MFI zeolite can be greatly enhanced by the presence of framework In(III) species, resulting into a high activity and stability during the ethane dehydrogenation reaction for more than 1000&#8197;h at 650&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Subnanometer metal clusters show advantages over conventional metal nanoparticles in numerous catalytic reactions owing to their high percentage of exposed surface sites, abundance of under&#8208;coordinated metal sites and unique electronic structures. However, the applications of subnanometer metal clusters in high&#8208;temperature catalytic reactions (&gt;600&#8201;&#176;C) are still hindered, because of their low stability under harsh reaction conditions. In this work, we have developed a zeolite&#8208;confined bimetallic PtIn catalyst with exceptionally high stability against sintering. A combination of experimental and theoretical studies shows that the isolated framework In(III) species serve as the anchoring sites for Pt species, precluding the migration and sintering of Pt species in the oxidative atmosphere at &#8805;650&#8201;&#176;C. The catalyst comprising subnanometer PtIn clusters exhibits long&#8208;term stability of &gt;1000&#8197;h during a cyclic reaction&#8208;regeneration test for ethane dehydrogenation reaction.

A MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is constructed for nitrite reduction reaction, delivering an NH3 yield of 11.46&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is an important route for sustainable NH3 synthesis and environmental remediation. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one family of promising NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts, however, there is plenty of room to improve in their performance, calling for new design principles. Herein, a MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is fabricated for efficient NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 production. By growing Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanorods on Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) nanosheets, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the formation of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Co bonds at the interface of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure, leading to dual active sites tailed for NO3&#8722;RR. The Ni sites facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722;, while the Co sites boost the H2O decomposition to supply active hydrogen (Hads) for N&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation on adjacent Ni sites, cooperatively reducing the energy barriers of NO3&#8722;RR process. Together with the accelerated electron transfer enabled by built&#8208;in electric field, remarkable NO3&#8722;RR performance is achieved with an NH3 yield rate of 11.46&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR process. Together with the accelerated electron transfer enabled by built-in electric field, remarkable NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Green Solvent &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) Facilitates Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel green solvent, &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), efficiently facilitates the photocatalytic activation of C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic compounds. Mechanistic studies reveal that GVL&#8242;s high dielectric constant (&#1013;) increases the driving force (&#8722;&#916;G), and its large refractive index (n) reduces reorganization energy (&#955;), collectively reducing the reaction barrier (&#916;G&#8800;). This research advances the overlooked solvent effects in semiconductor photocatalysis.







Abstract
Solvents can significantly influence chemical reactions in condensed phases. Their critical properties are increasingly recognized in various research domains such as organic synthesis and biomass valorization. However, in semiconductor photocatalysis, solvents are primarily viewed as mediums for dissolving and diffusing substances, with their potential beneficial effects on photocatalytic conversions often overlooked. Additionally, common photocatalysis solvents like acetonitrile (ACN) pose serious safety and environmental concerns. In this study, we demonstrate that novel and safe green solvents, such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), can significantly enhance the performance of semiconductor photocatalysis for C&#8722;H bond activation. Non&#8208;specific solvent&#8208;solute interactions are the primary contributors to increased photocatalytic activity in the self&#8208;coupling of benzylic compounds. Specifically, GVL&#8242;s large dielectric constant and high refractive index lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining C&#8722;H bond activation step, facilitating a faster coupling reaction. The versatility of GVL is further demonstrated in reactions with multiple reagents and in various oxidation and reduction photocatalytic systems beyond classic C&#8722;H bond activation. This work not only pioneers the use of green solvents but also provides comprehensive insights for proper solvent selection in semiconductor photocatalysis.

         <title>Simultaneous Defect Passivation and Co&#8208;Catalyst Engineering Leads to Superior Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) photocatalysts are bi&#8208;functionalized with lead sulfide (PbS) and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) co&#8208;catalysts on the surface. PbS can passivates the defects of MHPs and MoSx provides active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thus synergistically enhancing the charge transport efficiency and HER catalysis and achieving a superior solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) energy conversion efficiency of 4.63&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as attractive candidates for producing green hydrogen via photocatalytic pathway. However, the presence of abundant defects and absence of efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active sites on MHPs seriously limit the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency. Herein, to address this issue, we present a bi&#8208;functionalization strategy through decorating MHPs with a molecular molybdenum&#8208;sulfur&#8208;containing co&#8208;catalyst precursor. By virtue of the strong chemical interaction between lead and sulfur and the good dispersion of the molecular co&#8208;catalyst precursor in the deposition solution, a uniform and intimate decoration of the MHPs surface with lead sulfide (PbS) and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) co&#8208;catalysts is obtained simultaneously. We show that the PbS co&#8208;catalyst can effectively passivate the Pb&#8208;related defects on the MHPs surface, thus retarding the charge recombination and promoting the charge transfer efficiency significantly. The amorphous MoSx co&#8208;catalyst further promotes the extraction of photogenerated electrons from MHPs and facilitates the HER catalysis. Consequently, drastically enhanced photocatalytic HER activities are obtained on representative MHPs through the synergistic functionalization of PbS and MoSx co&#8208;catalysts. A solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency of ca. 4.63&#8201;% is achieved on the bi&#8208;functionalized FAPbBr3&#8208;xIx (FA=CH(NH2)2), which is among the highest values reported for MHPs.

         <title>A Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;Based Organic Semiconductor with Small Exciton Binding Energy via Molecular Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is recognized as a key physical parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in opto&#8208;electronic devices and organic photocatalysts (OPCs). The correlation between Eb and aggregation is important to achieve a small level of Eb in the solid state. Here, the influence of aggregation behavior on Eb and device/OPC functions were revealed by using two organic semiconductors with different aggregation behaviors.







Abstract
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is understood as the energy required to dissociate an exciton in free&#8208;charge carriers, and is known to be an important parameter in determining the performance of organic opto&#8208;electronic devices. However, the development of a molecular design to achieve a small level of Eb in the solid state continues to lag behind. Here, to investigate the relationship between aggregation and Eb, star&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD were developed using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE). Theoretical calculations and physical measurements in solution showed no apparent differences between DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD, indicating that these molecules possess similar properties on a single&#8208;molecule level. By contrast, pristine films incorporating these molecules showed significantly different levels of electron affinity, ionization potential, and optical gap. Also, DBC&#8208;RD had a smaller Eb value of 0.24&#8197;eV compared with that of TPE&#8208;RD (0.42&#8197;eV). However, these molecules showed similar Eb values under dispersed conditions, which suggested that the decreased Eb of DBC&#8208;RD in pristine film is induced by molecular aggregation. By comparison with TPE&#8208;RD, DBC&#8208;RD showed superior performances in single&#8208;component organic solar cells and organic photocatalysts. These results indicate that a molecular design suitable for aggregation is important to decrease the Eb in films.

         <title>Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Gaseous Ammonia: Stepping Over the Nitrogen Energy Canyon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier compound. The ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR) was investigated by direct utilization of gaseous NH3 at gas diffusion electrodes. The most selective catalyst composition of the different multi&#8208;metal catalysts was able to oxidize NH3 mainly to NO2&#8722; avoiding to a large extent the formation of energetically favorable N2 as well as O2, while H2 was exclusively formed at the cathode.







Abstract
As ammonia continues to gain more and more interest as a promising hydrogen carrier compound, so does the electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR). To avoid the liberation of H2 in a reverse Haber&#8211;Bosch reaction under release of the energetically more favorable N2, we propose the oxidation of ammonia to value&#8208;added nitrite (NO2&#8722;), which is usually obtained during the Ostwald process. We investigated the anodic oxidation of gaseous ammonia directly supplied to a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using a variety of compositionally different multi&#8208;metal catalysts coated on Ni foam under the simultaneous formation of H2 at the cathode. This will double the amount of H2 per ammonia molecule while applying a lower overpotential than that required for water electrolysis (1.4&#8211;1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A selectivity study demonstrated that some of the catalyst compositions were able to produce significant amounts of NO2&#8722;, and further investigations using the most promising catalyst composition Nif_AlCoCrCuFe integrated within a GDE demonstrated up to 88&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for NO2&#8722; at the anode coupled to close to 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the cathodic H2 production.

The ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR) was investigated by direct utilization of gaseous NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at gas diffusion electrodes. The most selective catalyst composition of the different multi-metal catalysts was able to oxidize NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; mainly to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; avoiding to a large extent the formation of energetically favorable N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was exclusively formed at the cathode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ammonia continues to gain more and more interest as a promising hydrogen carrier compound, so does the electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR). To avoid the liberation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a reverse Haber&#8211;Bosch reaction under release of the energetically more favorable N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we propose the oxidation of ammonia to value-added nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), which is usually obtained during the Ostwald process. We investigated the anodic oxidation of gaseous ammonia directly supplied to a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using a variety of compositionally different multi-metal catalysts coated on Ni foam under the simultaneous formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the cathode. This will double the amount of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per ammonia molecule while applying a lower overpotential than that required for water electrolysis (1.4&#8211;1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A selectivity study demonstrated that some of the catalyst compositions were able to produce significant amounts of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and further investigations using the most promising catalyst composition Ni&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;_AlCoCrCuFe integrated within a GDE demonstrated up to 88&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; at the anode coupled to close to 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the cathodic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revisiting the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Porous Electrodes in Li&#8208;ion Batteries by Employing Reference Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy interpretation is essential for comprehending the electrochemical processes in porous electrodes. This work demonstrates that the high&#8208;frequency impedance arc is attributed to the ion transport resistance in pore channels and solid electrolyte interphase, while the mid&#8208;frequency capacitive behavior results from a series connection of electrical double layer capacitance and pseudo&#8208;capacitance.







Abstract
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), characterized by its non&#8208;destructive and in situ nature, plays a crucial role in comprehending the thermodynamic and kinetic processes occurring within Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, there is a lack of consistent and coherent physical interpretations for the EIS of porous electrodes. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct thorough investigations into the underlying physical mechanisms of EIS. Herein, by employing reference electrode in batteries, we revisit the associated physical interpretation of EIS at different frequencies. Combining different battery configurations, temperature&#8208;dependent experiments, and elaborated distribution of relaxation time analysis, we find that the ion transport in porous electrode channels and pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior dominate the high&#8208;frequency and mid&#8208;frequency impedance arcs, respectively. This work offers a perspective for the physical interpretation of EIS and also sheds light on the understanding of EIS characteristics in other advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Regulating Zn2+ Migration&#8208;Diffusion Behavior by Spontaneous Cascade Optimization Strategy for Long&#8208;Life and Low N/P Ratio Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is reported firstly to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. A separation&#8208;reconstruction layer is constructed on the Zn anode. The soluble components can be separated into the electrolyte for primary optimization, and the poor&#8208;soluble components are reconstructed into flower&#8208;like arrays for secondary optimization. This strategy realizes the overall improvement of Zn ion battery performance.







Abstract
Parasitic side reactions and dendrite growth on zinc anodes are formidable issues causing limited lifetime of aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, a spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is first proposed to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. Specifically, PAPE@Zn layer with separation&#8208;reconstruction properties is constructed in situ on Zn anode. In this layer, well&#8208;soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) can spontaneously separation to bulk electrolyte and weaken the preferential coordination between H2O and Zn2+ to achieve primary optimization. Meanwhile, poor&#8208;soluble polymerized&#8208;4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (PACMO) is reconstructed on Zn anode as hydrophobic flower&#8208;like arrays with abundant zincophilic sites, further guiding the de&#8208;solvation and homogeneous diffusion of Zn2+ to achieve the secondary optimization. Cascade optimization effectively regulates Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior, dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode are negligible, and the stability is significantly improved. Consequently, symmetrical cells exhibit stability over 4000&#8197;h (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). PAPE@Zn//NH4+&#8722;V2O5 full cells with a high current density of 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 maintains 72.2&#8201;% capacity retention for 12000&#8197;cycles. Even better, the full cell demonstrates excellent performance of cumulative capacity of 2.33&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at ultra&#8208;low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 0.6 and a high mass&#8208;loading (~17&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The spontaneous cascade optimization strategy provides novel path to achieve high&#8208;performance and practical ZIBs.

         <title>Electrochemical Skeletal Indole Editing via Nitrogen Atom Insertion by Sustainable Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct editing of the core heterocyclic skeleton of pharmaceutical lead compounds typically relies on superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. Herein, we report the electrochemical nitrogen atom insertion reaction into indoles enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, leading to the formation of biologically active quinazoline scaffolds.







Abstract
Skeletal molecular editing gained considerable recent momentum and emerged as a uniquely powerful tool for late&#8208;stage diversifications. Thus far, superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents were largely required for skeletal indole editing. In contrast, we herein show that electricity enables sustainable nitrogen atom insertion reactions to give bio&#8208;relevant quinazoline scaffolds without stoichiometric chemical redox&#8208;waste product. The transition metal&#8208;free electro&#8208;editing was enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and proved robust on scale, while tolerating a variety of valuable functional groups.

         <title>Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;Valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional assembles were successfully obtained from spherical polyoxometalates and multinuclear platinum complexes. Each assemble has mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states and unpaired electrons on metal d orbitals, showing semiconducting behaviours, which was 105 times greater than that of the parent polyoxometalates.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanosized molecular metal oxide anion clusters with tuneable structures and functionalities, and they exhibit a redox chemistry and catalytic activity in multielectron redox processes. These are typically poor electrical conductors (&lt;10&#8722;10&#8201;Scm&#8722;1), which is attributed to negligible electronic interactions among anions in the solid state. Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed&#8208;valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin&#8208;type or Dawson&#8208;type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Hybridization Activates Lattice&#8208;Hydroxyl&#8208;Groups of NiCo(OH)x Nanowires for Efficient Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a concept for enhancing the electrochemical activation and dehydrogenation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups (M2+&#8722;O&#8722;H&#8652;M3+&#8722;O) to produce high&#8208;valence Ni3+/Co3+ active sites for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction. Notably, the dehydrogenation process is significantly augmented due to the electron&#8208;deficient Ni/Co sites and weakened O&#8722;H bond strength derived from the robust electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of benzoic acid ligands.







Abstract
Electrochemical dehydrogenation of hydroxides plays a crucial role in the formation of high&#8208;valence metal active sites toward 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to produce the value&#8208;added chemical of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic (FDCA). Herein, we construct benzoic acid ligand&#8208;hybridized NiCo(OH)x nanowires (BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x) with ample electron&#8208;deficient Ni/Co sites for HMFOR. The robust electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of benzoic acid ligands in BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x speeds up the electrochemical activation and dehydrogenation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups (M2+&#8722;O&#8722;H&#8652;M3+&#8722;O), boosting the formation of abundant electron&#8208;deficient and high&#8208;valence Ni/Co sites. DFT calculation reveals that the deintercalation proton is prone to establishing a hydrogen bridge with the carbonyl group in benzoic acid, facilitating the proton transfer. Coupled with the synergistic oxidation of Ni/Co sites on hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x delivers a remarkable current density of 111.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.4&#8197;V for HMFOR, exceeding that of NiCo(OH)x by approximately fourfold. And the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency are as high as 95.24&#8201;% and 95.39&#8201;%, respectively. The ligand&#8208;hybridized strategy in this work introduces a novel perspective for designing high&#8208;performance transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for biomass conversion.

         <title>3D Lead&#8208;Organoselenide&#8208;Halide Perovskites and their Mixed&#8208;Chalcogenide and Mixed&#8208;Halide Alloys</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium is introduced into the halide perovskite framework, for the first time, using the zwitterionic selenocysteamine. The average and local structures of these mixed&#8208;anion perovskites help determine the band structures and potential trap states, respectively. Calculations show dispersive bands and direct gaps, which can be further tuned to straddle the ideal values for tandem solar cells using halide alloying and chalcogenide alloying.







Abstract
We incorporate Se into the 3D halide perovskite framework using the zwitterionic ligand: SeCYS (+NH3(CH2)2Se&#8722;), which occupies both the X&#8722; and A+ sites in the prototypical ABX3 perovskite. The new organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites: (SeCYS)PbX2 (X=Cl, Br) expand upon the recently discovered organosulfide&#8208;halide perovskites. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis reveal the average structures of the organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites, whereas the local lead coordination environments and their distributions were probed through solid&#8208;state 77Se and 207Pb NMR, complemented by theoretical simulations. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that the band structures of (SeCYS)PbX2 largely resemble those of their S analogs, with similar band dispersion patterns, yet with a considerable band gap decrease. Optical absorbance measurements indeed show band gaps of 2.07 and 1.86&#8197;eV for (SeCYS)PbX2 with X=Cl and Br, respectively. We further demonstrate routes to alloying the halides (Cl, Br) and chalcogenides (S, Se) continuously tuning the band gap from 1.86 to 2.31&#8197;eV&#8211;straddling the ideal range for tandem solar cells or visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The comprehensive description of the average and local structures, and how they can fine&#8208;tune the band gap and potential trap states, respectively, establishes the foundation for understanding this new perovskite family, which combines solid&#8208;state and organo&#8208;main&#8208;group chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring the Whole Deposition Process from Hydrated Zn2+ to Zn0 for Stable and Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;Methylmethanesulfonamide (NMS) additive is introduced to alter the primary solvent shell of Zn2+, chemically adsorb on the metallic Zn surface, and in situ form an N&#8208;rich organic and inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI. These effects suppress the water&#8208;induced side reactions and ensure the fast transport kinetic and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
The practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) indeed faces challenges primarily attributed to the inherent side reactions and dendrite growth associated with the Zn anode. In the present work, N&#8208;Methylmethanesulfonamide (NMS) is introduced to optimize the transfer, desolvation, and reduction of Zn2+, achieving highly stable and reversible Zn plating/stripping. The NMS molecule can substitute one H2O molecule in the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+ and be preferentially chemisorbed on the Zn surface to protect Zn anode against corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby suppressing byproducts formation. Additionally, a robust N&#8208;rich organic and inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid solid electrolyte interphase is in situ generated on Zn anode due to the decomposition of NMS, resulting in enhanced Zn2+ transport kinetics and uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, aqueous cells with the NMS achieve a long lifespan of 2300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high cumulative plated capacity of 3.25&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent reversibility with an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7&#8201;% over 800 cycles.

The ESR spectra reported in a Research Article by Chao and co&#8208;workers are not in agreement with reactive &#8220;carbon radicals&#8221; claimed to be produced by 730&#8197;nm irradiation of the iridium(III) complex Ir4&#8208;red. The observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects must be induced by other, unidentified reactive intermediates.







Abstract
It is shown that data presented in a paper by Chao and co&#8208;workers do not support the formation of active &#8220;Carbon Radicals&#8221; as claimed according to the title. The assignments of observed ESR spectra and the mechanistic interpretation are severely flawed. Hence, other reactive intermediates must be responsible for the observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects.

         <title>Back Cover: Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;Valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical polyoxometalates , which are insulators, were successfully transformed into semiconductors by linking them with one&#8208;dimensional multinuclear platinum complexes. The assembles comprising two kinds of molecules are paramagnetic due to mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states, where unpaired electrons are delocalized over these backbones. Various derivatives with bandgap modulations are expected, represented by the flow of electricity in electronic circuits containing them, as reported by Kazuhiro Uemura et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407743).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2024)</title>

A new star in the catalyst sky The cover illustration artistically depicts a dilithium tetraalkynyl palladate catalyst as a constellation of stars in the firmament. This complex facilitates the conversion of aryl chlorides via a complex energy surface depicted as a mountain range. The THF solvent molecules are highlighted with a golden halo because they are a critical part of the catalyst system, enabling a stable bimetallic assembly of palladium and lithium. The catalysts are easily accessible from inexpensive components and allow various cross&#8208;couplings of non&#8208;activated aryl halides that were previously limited to phosphine or carbene systems, as reported by Lukas J. Goo&#223;en et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202408974). Design by Nele Kr&#252;ger and Dr. Jonas F. Goebel.

Dearomative construction of 2D/3D frameworks from 2D aromatics is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Ken Tanaka, Yuki Nagashima et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403461). The cover mage shows transformations from 2D quinolines into triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D rings through nucleophilic addition, borate complex formation, and photocycloaddition. Mechanistic studies revealed that the borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state.

Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are employed to covalently anchor Au and Ag atoms, resulting in bimetallic random copolymers, as reported by Ali Nazemi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409800). When these polymers are used as substrates and undergo reduction, they produce polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8211;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles, whose structures are influenced by the proportion of each metal in the metallopolymer. These nanomaterials have been shown to be effective in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Quaternization with Redox&#8208;Active Esters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kawamata, Baran, and Shenvi disclose a solitary iron&#8208;catalyzed conceptually distinct platform for constructing quaternary carbons using readily available and structurally diverse redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and olefins as modular coupling fragments. The heteroselective radical quaternization exhibits appreciable functional group tolerance and enables the synthesis of a palette of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules under practical conditions.







Abstract
Quaternary carbons are embedded in various natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials. However, constructing this valuable motif is far from trivial. Conventional approaches mainly rely on classical polar disconnections and encounter bottlenecks concerning harsh conditions, functional group tolerance, regioselectivity, and step economy. In this context, Kawamata, Baran, Shenvi, and co&#8208;workers recently demonstrated that two feedstock chemicals, alkyl carboxylic acids and olefins, could be utilized to construct tetrasubstituted carbons in the presence of an inexpensive iron porphyrin catalyst and a suitable reductant combination through quaternization of the radical intermediates. The method enables access to various sterically encumbered quaternary carbons under mild and robust conditions. Taking a complete detour from conventional approaches, the present heteroselective radical&#8211;radical coupling simplifies the synthesis of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules through an innovative and distinctive disconnection approach.

         <title>DNA Tetrahedra as Functional Nanostructures: From Basic Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA tetrahedral frameworks find diverse applications as functional constituents for operating dynamic networks, directing crystalline assembly, switchable biocatalysis, and medicine uses including sensing, and stimuli responsive drug carriers.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled supramolecular DNA tetrahedra composed of programmed sequence&#8208;engineered complementary base&#8208;paired strands represent elusive nanostructures having key contributions to the development and diverse applications of DNA nanotechnology. By appropriate engineering of the strands, DNA tetrahedra of tuneable sizes and chemical functionalities were designed. Programmed functionalities for diverse applications were integrated into tetrahedra structures including sequence&#8208;specific recognition strands (aptamers), catalytic DNAzymes, nanoparticles, proteins, or fluorophore. The article presents a comprehensive review addressing methods to assemble and characterize the DNA tetrahedra nanostructures, and diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra framework are discussed. Topics being addressed include the application of structurally functionalized DNA tetrahedra nanostructure for the assembly of diverse optical or electrochemical sensing platforms and functionalized intracellular sensing and imaging modules. In addition, the triggered reconfiguration of DNA tetrahedra nanostructures and dynamic networks and circuits emulating biological transformations are introduced. Moreover, the functionalization of DNA tetrahedra frameworks with nanoparticles provides building units for the assembly of optical devices and for the programmed crystallization of nanoparticle superlattices. Finally, diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra in the field of nanomedicine are addressed. These include the DNA tetrahedra&#8208;assisted permeation of nanocarriers into cells for imaging, controlled drug release, active chemodynamic/photodynamic treatment of target tissues, and regenerative medicine.

         <title>What's Next for First Row Fluorometallacycles?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key roles for fluorometallacycles in first row metal complex&#8208;catalyzed reactions are summarized and several future prospects identified.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon&#8208;derived metallacycles have been identified as key intermediates in a host of catalyzed transformations of unsaturated organic substrates. In contrast, our knowledge of analogous reactivity of fluorometallacycles is underdeveloped and largely confined to first row metals. Our summary of recent advances aims to inform young investigators of the exciting challenges offered by this pursuit.

         <title>Sulfurized Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Rechargeable Mg Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurized two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;MOF) promises high capacity Mg2+ storage. On the one hand, the 2D nature of the material enables fast and reversible Mg2+ diffusion. On the other hand, the S functional groups serve as reversible redox centers to host Mg2+.







Abstract
Rechargeable Mg batteries are a promising energy storage technology to overcome the limitations inherent to Li ion batteries. A critical challenge in advancing Mg batteries is the lack of suitable cathode materials. In this work, we report a cathode design that incorporates S functionality into two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (2D&#8208;MOFs). This new cathode material enables good Mg2+ storage capacity and outstanding cyclability. It was found that upon the initial Mg2+ insertion and disinsertion, there is an apparent structural transformation that crumbles the layered 2D framework, leading to amorphization. The resulting material serves as the active material to host Mg2+ through reduction and/or oxidation of S and, to a limited extent, O. The reversible nature of S and O redox chemistry was confirmed by spectroscopic characterizations and validated by density functional calculations. Importantly, during the Mg2+ insertion and disinsertion process, the 2D nature of the framework was maintained, which plays a key role in enabling the high reversibility of the MOF cathode.

         <title>Unlocking the Multistage Redox Property of Graphenic Radicals by &#960;&#8208;Extension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable &#960;&#8208;extended nanographene radical (NR1) is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits a distinctive four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, demonstrating that &#960;&#8208;extension could serve as a viable approach to unlock the multistage redox ability of delocalized organic radicals.







Abstract
Delocalized organic &#960;&#8208;radicals are intrinsically amphoteric redox systems; however, achieving their multistage redox capability presents a challenge. In addition, their instability often hampers their synthesis, isolation, and characterization. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable &#960;&#8208;extended nanographene &#960;&#8208;radical (NR1) and its isolation in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits an unusual four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The stable charged species, including a cation and a radical dication, are characterized using spectroscopic methods.

&lt;p&gt;A stable &#960;-extended nanographene radical (NR1) is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits a distinctive four-stage amphoteric redox behavior, demonstrating that &#960;-extension could serve as a viable approach to unlock the multistage redox ability of delocalized organic radicals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delocalized organic &#960;-radicals are intrinsically amphoteric redox systems; however, achieving their multistage redox capability presents a challenge. In addition, their instability often hampers their synthesis, isolation, and characterization. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable &#960;-extended nanographene &#960;-radical (NR1) and its isolation in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits an unusual four-stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The stable charged species, including a cation and a radical dication, are characterized using spectroscopic methods. This study demonstrates that &#960;-extension could serve as a viable approach to unlock the multistage redox ability of delocalized organic radicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Enhancement in Cobalt(II)&#8208;TPMA Aqueous Hydrogen Photosynthesis through Intramolecular Proton Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>

Introduction of proton relays close to the catalytic metal center boosts hydrogen photosynthesis with cobalt(II) TPMA complexes leading to a 4&#8208;fold increase in quantum efficiency and up to a 22&#8208;fold gain in turnover number.







Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen generation by cobalt(II) tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) complexes is mainly limited by protonation kinetics and decomposition routes involving demetallation. In the present work we have explored the effects of both proton shuttles and improved rigidity on the catalytic ability of cobalt(II) TPMA complexes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that, while a small enhancement in the catalytic performance is attained in a rigid cage structure, the introduction of ammonium groups as proton transfer relays in close proximity to the cobalt center allows to reach a 4&#8208;fold increase in the quantum efficiency of H2 formation, and a surprising 22&#8208;fold gain in the maximum turnover number, at low catalyst concentration. The beneficial role of the ammonium relays in promoting faster intramolecular proton transfer to the reduced cobalt center is documented by transient absorption spectroscopy, showcasing the great relevance of tuning the catalyst periphery to achieve efficient catalysis of solar fuel formation.

         <title>Quantitative Kinetic Insights from Operando&#8208;UV/Vis Spectroscopy: An Application to NH3&#8722;SCR of NOx on Cu&#8208;CHA Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV/Vis spectroscopy is coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic data, simultaneously monitoring both the catalyst redox state and the gas&#8208;phase dynamics during the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx with NH3 over Cu&#8208;CHA. This work highlights the accessibility of kinetic studies directly from operando UV/Vis spectroscopy paving the way for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relation under kinetically relevant conditions.







Abstract
We employ UV/Vis Diffuse Reflectance spectroscopy directly coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic information. We use as a show&#8208;case the CuII/CuI redox dynamics during the reduction half cycle of the NH3&#8208;Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) on Cu&#8208;CHA catalysts. Our measurements enable quantification of the fraction of oxidized Cu, reconstructed by Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) together with monitoring of the gas&#8208;phase evolution during the reaction. These data both on the dynamics of the gas&#8208;phase and of the active site oxidation state have been used to assess the reduction half cycle rate equation and estimate the rate constant. Our results in terms of reaction orders and kinetic constant are in line with previous findings in the literature. Overall, our results demonstrate that the combined analysis of the UV spectra and of the gas&#8208;phase dynamics provides converging and unparalleled kinetic insight: this approach effectively resolves ambiguities concerning RHC kinetics and mechanism. More in general, this work provides evidence that operando spectroscopy can be used to extract quantitative kinetic information on catalytic cycles.

         <title>Synthesis of a Gold&#8211;Silver Alloy Nanocluster within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate and Its Photocatalytic Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates (POMs) can serve as an effective stabilizing ligand for metal nanoclusters to impart distinctive structures and properties. We report the synthesis of a surface&#8208;exposed Au&#8722;Ag alloy nanocluster within a ring&#8208;shaped POM through reaction of an Ag nanocluster with Au ions (Au+). The resulting Au&#8722;Ag alloy nanocluster demonstrated remarkably enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation reactions and stability compared to the parent Ag nanocluster.







Abstract
Alloying is an effective method for modulating metal nanoclusters to enrich their structural diversity and physicochemical properties. Recent investigations have demonstrated that polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as effective multidentate ligands for silver (Ag) nanoclusters to endow them with synergistic properties, reactivity, catalytic properties, and stability. However, the application of POMs as ligands has been confined predominantly to monometallic nanoclusters. Herein, we report a synthetic method for fabricating surface&#8208;exposed gold (Au)&#8722;Ag alloy nanoclusters within a ring&#8208;shaped POM ([P8W48O184]40&#8722;). Reacting an Ag nanocluster stabilized by the ring&#8208;shaped POM with Au ions (Au+) was found to substitute several Ag atoms at the core of the nanocluster with Au atoms. The resultant {Au8Ag26} alloy nanocluster demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity and stability compared to the pristine Ag nanocluster in the aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene under visible&#8208;light irradiation. These findings provide fundamental insights into the formation and catalytic properties of POM&#8208;stabilized alloy nanoclusters and advance exploration into the synthesis and applications of diverse metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Formate&#8208;Mediated Electroenzymatic Synthesis via Biological Cofactor NADH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroenzyme&#8208;coupled system has been constructed for continuous biosynthesis of valuable chemicals with high production rates and turnover frequencies. In the system, formate is obtained from electroreduction of CO2 with good faradic efficiency at high current density and utilized for NADH regeneration with high selectivity. As a temporary energy carrier, formate ensures efficient energy transfer from electricity to chemical production.







Abstract
Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature's machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. Utilizing a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2 reduction to formate with approximately 90&#8201;% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilized redox enzymes&#8212;alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)&#8212;to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8&#215;106 to 3.1&#215;106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.

         <title>Customized Photoelectrochemical C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P Bond Formation Enabled by Tailored Deposition on Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With customized designs of the deposition layer on the BiVO4 photoanode, two PEC systems were developed for highly efficient catalytic C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. The modified BiVO4@Al2O3 demonstrated substantial performances for important yet challenging coupling between amides and xanthenes under aerobic conditions, whereas BiVO4@Ni1Co7Pi manifested its versatility in C&#8722;P coupling between aryl bromides and diphenylphosphine oxide, facilitated by a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cycle under ultralow potentials.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is burgeoning as an innovative solution to organic synthesis. However, the current PEC systems suffer from limited reaction types and unsatisfactory performances. Herein, we employ efficient BiVO4 photoanodes with tailored deposition layers for customizing two PEC approaches toward C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. Our process proceeds under mild reaction conditions, deploying easily available substrates and ultra&#8208;low potentials. Beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, customized PEC offers high efficiency, good functional group tolerance, and substantial applicability for decorating drug molecules, highlighting its promising potential to enrich the synthetic toolbox for broader organic chemistry of practical applications.

         <title>Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilithium tetraalkinyl palladates formed in situ from palladium salts and lithium alkynyls effectively promote the coupling of non&#8208;activated aryl chlorides with various nucleophiles with C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation. The applicability of the protocol has been demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The lithium alkinyls act as highly electron rich ligands that seem to be widely inert under the basic reaction conditions.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings of aryl chlorides usually call for bulky, electron&#8208;rich ligands such as phosphines or heterocyclic carbenes. We have now found that similarly powerful cross&#8208;coupling catalysts are obtained by the reaction of palladium salts with alkynyllithium reagents. The species initially formed in this process was characterized as a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate complex. It catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with the lithium salts of various terminal alkynes to give alkynyl arenes. The isolated Li&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Pd complex also efficiently promotes the reaction of aryl, and allyl chlorides with (hetero)aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208;, and allyllithium compounds as well as lithium amides. None of these reactions proceeded in the presence of palladium salts alone. The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49&#8197;molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

         <title>A [2.2]Isoindolinophanyl&#8208;Based Carbene (iPC) Ligand: Synthesis, Electronic and Photophysical Properties, and Application in Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically demanding, electrophilic [2.2]isoindolinophanyl&#8208;based carbene (iPC) acts as a potent &#960;&#8208;chromophore and participates in metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (CT) transitions in [RhCl(CO)2(iPC)] and intra&#8208;ligand&#8208;&#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;&#8208;CT transitions in [Au(iPC)2]OTf (5). The steric demand of the iPC leads to ultralong&#8208;lived green phosphorescence (&#964;=185&#8197;&#956;s) of 5 in solution, which in combination with the large accessible &#960; surface area has been exploited for energy transfer (EnT) photocatalysis.







Abstract
Cyclic amino(alkyl) and cyclic amino(aryl) carbenes (cAACs/cAArCs) have been established as very useful ligands for catalytic and photonic applications of transition metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a structurally related sterically demanding, electrophilic [2.2]isoindolinophanyl&#8208;based carbene (iPC) that bears a [2.2]paracyclophane moiety. The latter leads to more delocalized frontier orbitals and intense green fluorescence of (HiPC)OTf (2) from an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1ILCT) state in the solid state. Base&#8208;promoted synthesis of the free carbene led to an unusual ring expansion and subsequent dimerization reaction, but the beneficial ligand properties can be exploited by trapping in situ at a metal center. The iPC ligand is a very potent &#960;&#8208;chromophore, which participates in low energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand (ML)CT transitions in [RhCl(CO)2(iPC)] (4) and IL&#8208;&#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;&#8208;CT transitions in [Au(iPC)2]OTf (5). The steric demand of the iPC leads to high stability of 5 against air, moisture, or solvent attack, and ultralong&#8208;lived green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 185&#8197;&#956;s is observed in solution. The beneficial photophysical and electronic properties of the iPC ligand, including a large accessible &#960; surface area, were exploited by employing highly efficient energy transfer (EnT) photocatalysis in a [2+2] styrene cycloaddition reaction using 5, which outperformed other established photocatalysts in comparison.

Fluorescent probe for discovering the critical roles of CYP2D6 in natural systems: A fluorescent probe for CYP2D6 is designed using a tailored molecular strategy. The probe quantitatively detects and images CYP2D6 activity in various living systems, thereby providing a robust tool for exploration of the biological functions of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases and detailed investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme that mediates the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances in humans. However, its biological role in drug&#8208;drug interactions especially mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI), and various diseases remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for selectively monitoring CYP2D6 in complex biological systems. Herein, using a tailored molecular strategy, we developed a fluorescent probe BDPM for CYP2D6. BDPM exhibits excellent specificity and imaging capability for CYP2D6, making it suitable for the real&#8208;time monitoring of endogenous CYP2D6 activity in living bio&#8208;samples. Therefore, our tailored strategy proved useful for constructing the highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes. BDPM as a molecular tool to explore the critical roles of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases, high&#8208;throughput screening of inhibitors and intensive investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Highly Chiral 1T Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 nanosheets were produced via hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to control mirror symmetry breaking. This novel chiral inorganic nanomaterial exhibits a chiral morphology as well as remarkably high chiroptical activity, with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.01. The optimization of the synthetic conditions and the material's formation mechanism revealed critical details on the transfer of chirality.







Abstract
Chirality in inorganic nanostructures has recently stimulated the attention of many researchers, both to unravel fundamental questions on the origin of chirality in inorganic and hybrid materials, as well as to introduce novel promising properties that are originated by the symmetry breaking. MoS2 is one of the most investigated among the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, the metastable metallic 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase is of large interest for potential applications. However, due to thermodynamic reasons, the synthesis of 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase is quite challenging. Herein, we present the first synthesis of chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase which shows remarkably high chiroptical activity with a g&#8208;factor up to 0.01. Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 was produced using tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to induce symmetry breaking during the material's growth under hydrothermal conditions, leading to the formation of distorted hierarchical nanosheet assemblies exhibiting chiral morphology.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets were produced via hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to control mirror symmetry breaking. This novel chiral inorganic nanomaterial exhibits a chiral morphology as well as remarkably high chiroptical activity, with a g-factor of up to 0.01. The optimization of the synthetic conditions and the material's formation mechanism revealed critical details on the transfer of chirality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality in inorganic nanostructures has recently stimulated the attention of many researchers, both to unravel fundamental questions on the origin of chirality in inorganic and hybrid materials, as well as to introduce novel promising properties that are originated by the symmetry breaking. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the most investigated among the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, the metastable metallic 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase is of large interest for potential applications. However, due to thermodynamic reasons, the synthesis of 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase is quite challenging. Herein, we present the first synthesis of chiral 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase which shows remarkably high chiroptical activity with a g-factor up to 0.01. Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was produced using tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to induce symmetry breaking during the material's growth under hydrothermal conditions, leading to the formation of distorted hierarchical nanosheet assemblies exhibiting chiral morphology. Thorough optimization of the synthetic conditions was carried out to maximize chiroptical activity, which is strongly related to the nanostructures&#8217; morphology. Finally, the formation mechanism of the chiral 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet assemblies was investigated, focusing on the role of molecular intermediates in the growth of the nanosheets and the transfer of chirality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Outstanding Superoxide Dismutase Catalytic Activity Of Simple Peptide&#8208;Based Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>

Be positive! A novel Ni superoxide dismutase mimic was engineered, taking advantage of the versatility of the Amino Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) motif to introduce positive charges around the NiII center. This strategy yielded the most potent synthetic NiSOD mimic reported to date, in terms of catalytic efficacy and stability.







Abstract
We present here the most active synthetic Ni superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) mimic reported to date. Reactive oxygen species are aggressive compounds, which concentrations are tightly regulated in vivo. Among them, the superoxide anion, O2&#8901;&#8722;, is controlled by superoxide dismutases. Capitalizing on the versatility of the Amino&#8208;Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) peptide motif, we introduced positive charges around the NiII center to favor the interaction with the superoxide radical anion. At physiological pH, the pentapeptide H&#8722;Cys&#8722;His&#8722;Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Arg&#8722;NH2 coordinates NiII after the deprotonation of one thiol, two amides, and either the second thiol or the N&#8208;terminal ammonium, leading to an equilibrium between the two N3S1 and N2S2 coordination modes. Under catalytic conditions, a kcat value of 8.6(4)&#215;106&#8197;L.mol&#8722;1.s&#8722;1 was measured. Within the first second, the catalyst remained undegraded with quantitative consumption of O2&#8901;&#8722; (completed up to 37 catalytic cycles). An extra arginine (Arg) was introduced at the peptide C&#8208;terminus to increase the global charge of the NiII complex from +1 to +2. This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.

         <title>Poly(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)&#8208;Capped Alloy and Core&#8208;Shell AuAg Bimetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) are used to covalently immobilize Au and Ag atoms to yield bimetallic random copolymers. Reduction of such polymers results in the formation of polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8211;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles whose structures are governed by the relative metal content in their corresponding metallopolymers. The application of these nanomaterials in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted considerable attention. While most efforts in the field have been devoted to the development of NHC&#8208;tethered monometallic NPs and enhancing their stabilities under various conditions, their bimetallic counterparts are rare in the literature. Herein, we demonstrate that the covalent immobilization of Au and Ag atoms on polymerized NHCs is a powerful method to access bimetallic AuAg NPs. In addition, we show that while AuAg alloy NPs are often obtained via this method, the use of bimetallic polymeric substrates with lower Ag content, relative to Au, results in the formation of core&#8211;shell NPs with Au core and Ag shell. Application of these nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated with all materials exhibiting electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates for the first time that while bimetallic poly(NHC&#8208;metal)s are viable substrates to access NHC&#8208;stabilized bimetallic NPs, careful adjustment of metal content in the polymeric substrates can finetune the microstructure of the resulting NPs, i.e. alloy vs. core&#8211;shell.

A schematic of monoethylene glycol (MEG) adsorption measurements using a permeable membrane and a Type&#8197;3 porous liquid showing selective adsorption due to inclusion into the pores of the dispersed porous solid.







Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) are a new type of fluid sorbent investigated mainly for the separation of gas mixtures. Here, we explore their application to the separation of miscible liquids, using MEG/water (MEG=monoethylene glycol) and EtOH/water as proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle. Recovery of used MEG is industrially important but its extraction into conventional solvents from water is difficult. PLs ZIF&#8208;8@PDMS (PL1, PDMS=polydimethylsilicone) or ZIF&#8208;8@sesame oil (PL2) each consisting of 25&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the hydrophobic microporous material ZIF&#8208;8 dispersed in PDMS or sesame oil respectively, were formulated and found to be exceedingly physically stable to sedimentation. A 5&#8197;nm PEEK membrane was used to provide a permeable barrier between the PL and the alcohol/water phase. MEG was selectively extracted through the membrane from approximately 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;wt&#8201;% MEG/water mixtures into the PL phase and this procedure could be applied repeatedly. It was effective for MEG/water mixtures as dilute as 3&#8201;:&#8201;97&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The PL could also be regenerated (80&#8201;&#176;C at 0.01&#8197;bar) and re&#8208;used, suggesting its potential for continuous, cyclic extraction. Furthermore, PL3 (silicalite&#8208;1@PDMS) was effective in selective alcohol extraction from beverages. It shows potential for lowering the alcohol concentration in gin or wine due to its excellent chemical stability and nontoxicity. Overall, we show that the enhanced adsorption properties of PLs due the presence of empty pores,&#160;which provides unusually high gas solubilities, also makes them, in principle, applicable to liquid&#8208;liquid separations.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axial Biaryls by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Using Engineered Imine Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) was developed. This DKR approach features a transient aza&#8208;acetal bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an engineered imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to generate the axial chirality, providing various biaryls in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er).







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl compounds are ubiquitous scaffolds in natural products, bioactive molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts, but biocatalytic methods for their asymmetric synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). This DKR approach features a transient six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;acetal&#8208;bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to construct the axial chirality under ambient conditions. Directed evolution of an IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 provided a variant (S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11) capable of catalyzing the DKR process to access a variety of biaryl aminoalcohols in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio). Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11 variant revealed the origin of its improved activity and atroposelectivity.

     alt="Atroposelective Synthesis of Axial Biaryls by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Using Engineered Imine Reductases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) was developed. This DKR approach features a transient aza-acetal bridge-promoted racemization followed by an engineered imine reductase (IRED)-catalyzed stereoselective reduction to generate the axial chirality, providing various biaryls in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axially chiral biaryl compounds are ubiquitous scaffolds in natural products, bioactive molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts, but biocatalytic methods for their asymmetric synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). This DKR approach features a transient six-membered aza-acetal-bridge-promoted racemization followed by an imine reductase (IRED)-catalyzed stereoselective reduction to construct the axial chirality under ambient conditions. Directed evolution of an IRED from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces sp&lt;/i&gt;. GF3546 provided a variant (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-IRED-&lt;i&gt;Ss&lt;/i&gt;-M11) capable of catalyzing the DKR process to access a variety of biaryl aminoalcohols in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &amp;gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio). Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-IRED-&lt;i&gt;Ss&lt;/i&gt;-M11 variant revealed the origin of its improved activity and atroposelectivity. By exploiting the substrate promiscuity of IREDs and the power of directed evolution, our work further extends the biocatalysts&#8217; toolbox to construct challenging axially chiral molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Dehydration&#8208;Assisted Functionalization of Quantum Dots and Rods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) enables rapid ligand exchange and dense surface modification of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs). This study highlights DAF's role in preparing chiral QRs, engineering QD surface charge, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF provides a versatile solution for diverse QD and QR functionalization applications.







Abstract
Functionalization of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs) with ligands is essential for their further practical application across various domains. Dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) is a versatile method applicable to a wide range of hydrophilic ligands with an affinity to the surface of QDs and QRs. This approach facilitates rapid one&#8208;pot ligand exchange and dense modification by efficiently transferring these ligands onto the surface of QDs and QRs. This study demonstrates the efficacy of DAF in preparing chiral QRs, engineering the surface charge of QDs, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating dense DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF therefore offers a versatile solution for hydrophilic ligand functionalization of QDs and QRs applicable to diverse applications.

         <title>Bismuth as a Z&#8208;Type Ligand: an Unsupported Pt&#8722;Bi Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interaction and its Umpolung by Reaction with H2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bismuth cation [BiMe2(SbF6)] reacts with [Pt(PCy3)2] to give heterobimetallic [(PCy3)2Pt&#8594;BiMe2(SbF6)] (1). Compound 1 and related species show the first unsupported M&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor interactions (M=transition metal), establishing [BiMe2]+ as an effective and robust Z&#8208;type ligand, and experience pronounced spin&#8208;orbit coupling. 1 activates H2, triggering a sequence of reactions that furnish the umpolung of Pt&#8594;Bi to Bi&#8594;Pt dative bonding.







Abstract
Establishing unprecedented types of bonding interactions is one of the fundamental challenges in synthetic chemistry, paving the way to new (electronic) structures, physicochemical properties, and reactivity. In this context, unsupported element&#8208;element interactions are particularly noteworthy since they offer pristine scientific information about the newly identified structural motif. Here we report the synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the heterobimetallic Bi/Pt compound [Pt(PCy3)2(BiMe2)(SbF6)] (1), bearing the first unsupported transition metal&#8594;bismuth donor/acceptor interaction as its key structural motif. 1 is surprisingly robust, its electronic spectra are interpreted in a fully relativistic approach, and it reveals an unprecedented reactivity towards H2.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Baphicacanthcusine A Enabled by Sequential Ring Contractions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative ring contraction strategy was employed to accomplish the first total synthesis of baphicacanthcusine A. Rapid construction of a key seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring intermediate set the stage for a series of diastereoselective oxidations to access the skeleton of the natural product. Selective C&#8722;H oxidation gave rise to baphicacanthcusine A in 11&#8197;steps from 3,3&#8217;&#8208;biindole.







Abstract
Reported herein is the first total synthesis of the poly&#8208;pseudoindoxyl natural product baphicacanthcusine A. The synthesis leverages the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to pseudoindoxyls to install vicinal pseudoindoxyl heterocycles in a diastereoselective manner. Key steps include an acid&#8208;mediated cyclization/indole transposition, two diastereoselective oxidative ring contractions, and a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H oxygenation. The synthesis of the oxidation precursors was guided by recognition of an element of hidden symmetry. This work provides a foundation for the chemical synthesis of other poly&#8208;pseudoindoxyl alkaloids.

         <title>A Modified Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis Reaction for Selective Alkylation of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective alkylation method without using strong acids, bases, or metals is reported. This method, which is mechanistically related to the Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis reaction, employes a combination of phosphinites/phosphites and ethyl acrylate as effective alkylating agents, achieving chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective modification of complex natural products and pharmaceutical agents.







Abstract
The alkylation of nucleophiles is among the most fundamental and well&#8208;developed transformations in chemistry. However, to achieve selective alkylation of complex substrates remains a nontrivial task. We report herein a general and selective alkylation method without using strong acids, bases, or metals. In this method, the readily available phosphinites/phosphites, in combination with ethyl acrylate, function as effective alkylating agents. Various nucleophilic groups, including alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, imides, and thiols can be alkylated. This method can be applied in the late&#8208;stage alkylation of natural products and pharmaceutical agents, achieving chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective modification of complex substrates. Experimental studies indicate the relative reactivity of a nucleophile depends on its acidity and its steric environment. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction pathway resembles that of the Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis reaction.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization: Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions and Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non&#8208;covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non&#8208;covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion. These templates showcase versatility and demonstrate potential applications across diverse contexts within the area of remote functionalization.

         <title>Integrated Design of Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Copper Complex Catalysts to Enable Synergistic Effects on Sulfur and Lithium Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatal polysulfide shuttling, sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and detrimental lithium dendrites have curtailed the real discharge capacity, working lifespan and safety of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Organic small molecule promotors as one type of emerging active catalysts can fulfil the management of the electrochemical species evolution behaviors. Herein, an integrated engineering is organized by synthesizing dual chlorine&#8208;bridge enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu2(phen)2Cl2) and its derivative generated in electrolyte (Cu&#8208;ETL) as the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst, respectively. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;ETL with a optimized concentration of 0.25 wt.% as a homogeneous enabler offers highly utilized Cu centers and the sufficient interface contact for guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions. The Cu2(phen)2Cl2 loaded on carbon spheres as an interlayer (Cu&#8208;INT) can break through the catalytic limitation resulting from the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;ETL and thus offers an extended manipulation effect. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the Li&#8211;S battery shows stable cycling at 3 C upon 500 cycles with a capacity degradation rate as low as 0.029% per cycle. Of specific note, an actual cell energy density of 372.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 is harvested by a 1.2 Ah&#8208;level soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell, implying a chance for requiring the demand of high&#8208;energy batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;[18F]Trifluoroiodomethane&#160;&#8211; Enabling Photoredox&#8208;mediated Radical [18F]Trifluoromethylation for Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) is highly dependent on the available synthetic tools for their radiosynthesis. Herein, we present the&#160;radiosynthesis and application of [18F]trifluoroiodomethane &#8211; the first reagent for broad scope radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry in high molar activity. CF218FI can be prepared from [18F]fluoroform with 67&#177;5% AY and &gt;99% RCP. Its synthetic utility is demonstrated by the radiosynthesis of previously unprecedented 18F&#8208;labeled a&#8208;trifluoromethyl ketones and trifluoromethyl sulfides, important motifs that are present in a range of bioactive compounds. Both protocols are Ru&#8208; and photo&#8208;mediated and proceed under mild reaction conditions. They show good functional group tolerance evidenced by the respective reaction scopes and make use of easily obtainable starting materials. The products can be isolated in 8.3&#8208;11.1 GBq/&#181;mol (starting from ca. 5&#160;GBq [18F]fluoride). The applicability to PET tracer synthesis is shown by the radiolabeling of bioactive compounds, such as derivatives of probenecid and febuxostat. In a broader context, this work opens the door to the utilization of radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry for the radiolabeling of PET tracers in high molar activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of Staffanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first conductance measurements of [n]staffane oligomers in single&#8208;molecule junctions. Our studies reveal two quantum transport characteristics unique to staffanes that emerge from their strained bicyclic structure. First, though staffanes are composed of weakly conjugated C&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;bonds, staffanes carry a shallower conductance decay value (&#946; = 0.84 &#177; 0.02 n&#8208;1) than alkane chain analogs (&#946; = 0.96 &#177; 0.03 n&#8208;1) when measured with the scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Staffanes are&#160;more conductive than other &#963;&#8208;bonded organic backbones in the literature on a per atom basis. Density functional theory calculations suggest staffane backbones are effective conduits for charge transport because their significant bicyclic ring strain destabilizes the HOMO&#8208;2 energy, aligning it more closely with the Fermi energy as oligomer order increases. Second, the monostaffane is significantly lower conducting than expected. DFT calculations suggest that short monostaffanes sterically enforce insulating gauche interelectrode orientations over syn orientations. Meanwhile,&#160;[2&#8208;5]staffane wires may accommodate axial mechanical strain by &#8220;rod&#8208;bending&#8221;. These findings show for the first time how bicyclic ring strain can enhance charge transmission in saturated molecular wires. These studies showcase the STM&#8208;BJ technique as a valuable tool for uncovering the stereoelectronic proclivities of molecules at material interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Boron Amino Acid for Positron Emission Tomography and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoroborate boronophenylalanine (BBPA) is a boron amino acid analog of 4&#8209;boronophenylalanine (BPA) but with a trifluoroborate group (&#8208;BF3&#8208;) instead of a carboxyl group (&#8208;COOH). Clinical studies have shown that 18F&#8208;labeled BBPA ([18F]BBPA) can produce high&#8208;contrast tumor images in positron emission tomography (PET). Beyond PET imaging, BBPA is a theranostic agent for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Because BBPA possesses an identical chemical structure to BNCT and PET, it can potentially predict the boron concentration for BNCT using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. The synthesis of BBPA was achieved by selectively fluorinating the &#945;&#8208;aminoborate compound, taking advantage of the varying rates of solvolysis of the B&#8208;F bond. The study showcased the high&#8208;contrast [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET imaging in various tumor models, highlighting its broad applicability for both [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET and BBPA&#8208;BNCT. [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET tumor uptake remains consistent across various doses, including those used in BNCT. This enables accurate estimation of the boron concentration in tumors using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. With its dual boron structure, BBPA increases boron concentration in tumor cells and tumor tissues compared to BPA. Thus, less boron carrier is needed. This study introduces a new theranostic boron carrier that enhances boron accumulation in tumors, predicts boron concentration, and enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of BNCT.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Tandem Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Systems Based on Structure Adaption to Boost Water Contaminant Mineralization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mineralization of emerging contaminants by using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is a desirable option to ensure water safety, but still challenged by the excessive chemical and/or energy input. Here, we conceptually proposed the tandem reaction system (TRS) of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on structure adaption of target contaminants. To construct a model TRS, we first realized highly selective generation of three classical ROS (1O2, HO&#8226; and SO4&#8226;&#8211;) by peroxymonosulfate activation in an electrochemical Fenton&#8208;like system, where three replaceable Fe&#8208;centered cathodes were rationally designed as electronic mediator. The 1O2+SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;TRS exhibited nearly 100% mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), whereas only 34.2%, 56.2% and 60.8% for each of the single 1O2/HO&#8226;/SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;AOP systems. Mechanism exploration of SMX degradation in TRS evidenced that the initial reaction with 1O2 selectively destructed the sulfonamide bridge of SMX to form p&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which will be vulnerable to sequent SO4&#8226;&#8211; attack to facilitate mineralization. Successful extendibility of 1O2+SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;TRS to other sulfonamide antibiotics and 1O2+HO&#8226;&#8208;TRS to phenolic and arylcarboxylic compounds, as well as the demonstration of 1O2+SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;TRS in treatment of three actual pharmaceutical wastewaters strongly support that TRS is a powerful and sustainable strategy to enhance the mineralization of emerging contaminants in water.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

The antibody-embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer-targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Dendrite&#8208;Free Flexible Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. This work offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.







Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. Hydrogel electrolytes present a compelling alternative to liquid electrolytes due to their remarkable flexibility and clear advantages in mitigating parasitic side reactions. However, hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100&#8197;kPa and 5338&#8201;%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400&#8197;h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.

         <title>Heteroatoms&#8208;Stabilized Single Palladium Atoms on Amorphous Zeolites: Breaking the Tradeoff between Catalytic Activity and Selectivity for Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on heteroatom (B, Al, or Ga)&#8208;containing amorphous zeolite, achieves the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, demonstrating a recorded turnover frequency value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high styrene selectivity (95&#8201;%).







Abstract
As a fundamental industrial catalytic process, the semihydrogenation of alkynes presents a challenge in striking a balance between activity and selectivity due to the issue of over&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on boron&#8208;containing amorphous zeolites (Pd/AZ&#8722;B), achieving the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes. Advanced characterizations and theoretical density functional theory calculations confirm that the incorporated B atoms in the Pd/AZ&#8722;B can not only alter the geometric and electronic properties of Pd atoms by controlling the electron migration from Pd but also mitigate the interaction between alkene and the catalyst supports. This boosts the exceptional catalytic efficacy in the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene under mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), achieving a recorded turnover frequency (TOF) value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and demonstrating 95&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at full conversion of phenylacetylene. By comparison, the heteroatom&#8208;free amorphous zeolite&#8208;anchored Pd nanoparticles and the commercial Lindlar catalyst have styrene selectivities of 73&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. This work establishes a solid foundation for developing highly active and selective hydrogenation catalysts by controllably optimizing their electronic and steric properties.

         <title>Spatial&#8208;coupled Ampere&#8208;level Electrochemical Propylene Epoxidation over RuO2/Ti Hollow&#8208;fiber Penetration Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ampere&#8208;level propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) is achieved over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) in a membraneless reactor, in virtue of the synergetic combination of both the penetration effect and the spatial&#8208;coupling strategy, exhibiting specificity propylene oxide (PO) production of over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency (FEPO) and a maximum 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 PO partial current density (jPO), with significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.







Abstract
The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to ampere level (achieving over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging P and Fe from spent LiFePO4 cathodes, in situ generated PO43&#8722; and NiOOH/Fe3(PO4)2 heterointerfaces effectively inhibit chlorine oxidation while promoting OH&#8722; adsorption and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electrostatic modulation. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8722; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8722; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3&#8201;% activity loss after 600&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, dual catalytic method for the structural isomerisation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;make tertiary allylic alcohols into &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include a two&#8208;step homologation of diaryl ketone drug molecules.







Abstract
Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones via a H&#8208;atom transfer initiated semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful polymerization of water, isocyanide, and chlorooxime was established toward polyamide with a novel modifiable architecture. Through hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction, emissive units were introduced to the polyamide, which emission colors could range from blue to red. The refractive index (n) of polyamides was also significantly improved and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53 900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589&#8197;nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of the entire electrooxidation reaction pathway on the Pd single crystal surface can be outlined by obtaining the direct spectroscopic evidence of *OH and *OO intermediates via in situ Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that surface&#8208;adsorbed ClO4&#8722; ions can facilitate the deprotonation process of *OH and accelerate the electrooxidation process.







Abstract
The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8722; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8722; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Front Cover: Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/non&#8208;natural Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying evolution to create bioactive molecules beyond natural building blocks (BBs) is crucial for chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the application of evolution with many different non&#8208;natural BBs remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202409746), Yixin Zhang, Fazheng Ren, Weilin Lin et&#8197;al. developed a programmable chemical evolution approach using natural/non&#8208;natural BBs. It starts from creating ancestral molecules, followed by evolving high&#8208;affinity peptidomimetic binders in just a few generations within an astronomically large combinatorial space.

Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300 mm s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

         <title>Back Cover: Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal operando Raman spectroscopy, combined with kinetic analysis under controlled chemical conditions, was employed to investigate the formation of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their kinetic impact during methane dry reforming on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, as reported by Matteo Monai, Matteo Maestri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408668). In the cover image, an increased CO2 content (depicted by the hot air balloon) relative to methane (represented by the basket) inhibits methane from leading to coke formation, symbolized by the mountains (Cover design: Lia Tagliavini).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution&#8211;recrystallization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) opens exciting possibilities for fluorochromic detection of radionuclides. In their Research Article (e202410453), Jian Lin et al. introduce a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based MOFs. The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8211;recrystallization mechanism, transforming a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

         <title>Front Cover: Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

         <title>Front Cover: Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a &#8220;simple&#8221; yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization of Simple Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) system is reported that facilitates the direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to give substituted phenols. The process entails successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and leverages molecular oxygen from the air to drive the reaction cycle. This approach serves as a robust alternative to conventional synthetic methods.







Abstract
Direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to synthesize substituted phenols represents a significant challenge in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe a novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) catalytic system that converts substituted cyclohexanones into the corresponding phenols. This process involves the successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within the six&#8208;membered ring of cyclohexanones and utilizes molecular oxygen to drive the reaction cycle. It demonstrates a versatile and efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted phenols, providing a valuable complement to existing chemical methodologies.

         <title>In situ Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Electronic Bridge on COF to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the photocatalytic process, Ru atoms are anchored in situ by COF&#8208;Cu3TG, forming a single&#8208;atom electronic bridge between layers. This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Axial Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection by a Two&#8208;Dimensional Biaxial Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection was achieved by using the multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric material BA2EA2Pb3I10 for the first time. It presents ultra&#8208;low detection limits along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis (19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) at zero bias, which was two orders of magnitude lower than commercial &#945;&#8208;Se.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. However, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23&#8197;V and 0.22&#8197;V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.

         <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission&#8208;Dominated Design Strategy for Constructing Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots With Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated strategy was proposed, achieving desired Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, crosslinking, conjugation and steric hindrance factors were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission.







Abstract
Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emissions to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense non&#8208;radiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e., crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8722;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs but also helps understand the origin of NIR RTP to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

         <title>Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoester and 1,3&#8208;Diol to Access Chemically Recyclable and Mechanically Robust Poly(vinyl alcohol) Thermosets through Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester</title>

TOC: &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester was designed and used to prepare high&#8208;performance poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a straightforward modification with &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, followed by the cross&#8208;linking reaction with 1,3&#8208;diol groups. Treatment with HCl solution and heat allows the deconstruction of the cross&#8208;linked PVA, ensuring the selective and quantitative recovery of the initial materials.







Abstract
The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of &#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with &#946;&#8208;ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross&#8208;linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. The cross&#8208;linking architecture improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, i.e. approximately 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&gt;90&#8201;%) of PVA. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conductance increases with length at a significant rate in a series of bis(indeno)acene molecular wires. The rapid shrinking of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap induced by the singlet diradicaloid character of these compounds is responsible for the observed behaviour. These results pave the way to long&#8208;range, efficient coherent tunnelling charge transport.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states&#8212;especially in contact with metallic electrodes&#8212;is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window (

&#177;1.3V

 ${\pm 1.3\ V}$



). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.

We present a plug and play approach for the direct control of small GTPase activation in living cells. This approach is applied to the temporal control of filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, cell retraction, and MAPK signaling.







Abstract
Small GTPases comprise a superfamily of over 167 proteins in the human genome and are critical regulators of a variety of pathways including cell migration and proliferation. Despite the importance of these proteins in cell signaling, a standardized approach for controlling small GTPase activation within living cells is lacking. Herein, we report a split&#8208;protein&#8208;based approach to directly activate small GTPase signaling in living cells. Importantly, our fragmentation site can be applied across the small GTPase superfamily. We highlight the utility of these standardized parts by demonstrating the ability to directly modulate the activity of four different small GTPases with user&#8208;defined inputs, providing the first plug and play system for direct activation of small GTPases in living cells.
