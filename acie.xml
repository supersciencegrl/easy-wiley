         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208; mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin&#8208;/caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin&#8208;loaded mNbTAC, named&#160;Doxo&#8208;mvNbsPPH, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8208;L1&#160;and HER2&#160;targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8+&#160;T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11&#8208;fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Interception of Alkynyl Tetracoordinate Borons with Sulfur Electrophiles beyond the Zweifel Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zweifel reaction is a powerful strategy to construct olefins from alkenyl tetracoordinate borons in organoboron chemistry, however, it usually only involves one functional group migration and then undergoes an elimination process affording alkenes or alkynes exclusively. Herein, we disclose several intriguing interception of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons with sulfur electrophiles. Wherein, the substituted benzothiophenes are accessed by consecutive 1,2&#8208;migrations and intramolecular electrophilic substitution, meanwhile, the challenging and elusive five/four&#8208;membered boracycles are easily assembled, and an approach to alkenyl sulfides with good stereoselectivity was developed as well. Moreover, by adding readily available deuterium sources, the tetrasubstituted deuterated alkenyl sulfides with high deuteration rates are constructed. These protocols not only improve atom economy by prohibiting the elimination of Zweifel intermediate, but also enriches the reaction modes of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons achieving versatile value&#8208;added sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that dichlorosulfoxide (SOCl2) and dialkylaminosulfur trifluoride&#8208;type reagents (DAST&#8208;type) as surfur sources could promote dual 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons, which are distinct from traditional Zweifel reaction, and the regulation of steric hindrance could also make four&#8208;membered boracycles and alkenyl sulfides feasible. And these transformations feature novel reaction modes and unusual reaction mechanisms with valuable products in high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Modified Buried Interface of High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of interfaces remains a critical and challenging aspect in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interfacial layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs. The two carboxylic acid moieties on HBPDC bind to SnO2 through esterification, while its nitrogen atoms, possessing lone electron pairs, interact with uncoordinated lead (Pb2+) atoms through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This dual functionality enables simultaneous passivation of surface defects on both the SnO2 and buried perovskite layers. In addition, the electron&#8208;deficient nature of HBPDC enhances interfacial energy band alignment and facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO2. Furthermore, the incorporation of HBPDC strengthens the interfacial adhesion, improving mechanical reliability. As a result, the PSCs exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% under standard AM 1.5G conditions, along with remarkable environmental stability.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Aldimine Umpolung/6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Cascade to Access Tetracyclic Dihydrochromeno Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The umpolung of aldimines using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is less explored compared to the established polarity reversal of aldehydes. Described herein is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung /6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade, which leads to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles. For the first time, the nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates have been intercepted with unactivated alkynes. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8208;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise manner. DFT studies also support the regioselectivity preference for the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway, leading to the exclusive formation of the indole products. Moreover, a comparison of Gibbs free energies provides insight into a thermodynamically preferred 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization over a competing oxa&#8208;Michael pathway. Further, this strategy is applied to the formal synthesis of a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor in a step&#8208;economical method.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Redox Reactions of Silver Hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue Analogue Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Zinc&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been employed as host materials of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), however, they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to limited electron transfer and the presence of interstitial water in PBAs. Herein, a vacancy and water&#8208;free silver hexacyanoferrate K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)6 (AgHCF&#8208;3) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework. It offers nearly four electrons involving two sequential redox reactions, namely, Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag0, to deliver a large capacity of 179.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 mA g&#8208;1 with Coulomb efficiency of ~100%. The Zn//AgHCF&#8208;3 cell delivers an estimated energy density of 200 Wh kg&#8208;1, surpassing reported PBAs&#8208;based ZIBs. The formation of Ag0 in the cycling process merits favorable rate performance of AgHCF&#8208;3 (156.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 200 mA g&#8208;1 with 80.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles). This investigation paves new pathways for high&#8208;capacity PBA cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Energy Gap&#8208;Regulated Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8208;guest Doped Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials via host&#8208;guest doped method receive considerable attention in the fields of optoelectronics, bioimaging, and information encryption. Despite many host&#8208;guest doped materials with excellent RTP properties have been developed, their luminous mechanism is still limited. Here, a series of host&#8208;guest doped materials, using Benzophenone as the host and quinone compounds as the guests, were constructed to investigate the effect of the triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) between the host and guest on triplet states population. The guest&#8217;s triplet state is proposed to be a &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;, gathering the triplet excitons to emit RTP when &#916;ET&#160;is large and returning triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET&#160;is small. By combining the results of steady&#8208;state and delayed emission spectra, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption, and theoretical calculations, A bidirectional energy transfer process is proved, which are triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer processes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials via host-guest doped method receive considerable attention in the fields of optoelectronics, bioimaging, and information encryption. Despite many host-guest doped materials with excellent RTP properties have been developed, their luminous mechanism is still limited. Here, a series of host-guest doped materials, using Benzophenone as the host and quinone compounds as the guests, were constructed to investigate the effect of the triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) between the host and guest on triplet states population. The guest&#8217;s triplet state is proposed to be a &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;, gathering the triplet excitons to emit RTP when &#916;ET&#160;is large and returning triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET&#160;is small. By combining the results of steady-state and delayed emission spectra, time-resolved transient absorption, and theoretical calculations, A bidirectional energy transfer process is proved, which are triplet-triplet energy transfer and reverse triplet-triplet energy transfer processes. The thermal equilibrium of these two energy transfer processes can be regulated by the &#916;ET&#160;and temperature. The potential applications of these RTP properties are also realized in data encryption and anti-counterfeiting. This work provides valuable insight into the design of host-guest doped materials based on energy transfer mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable, High&#8208;Yield Monolayer MXene Preparation from Multilayer MXene for Many Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is renowned for its exceptional conductivity and hydrophilicity;&#160;however,&#160;the low yield of monolayers hinders its industrial scalability. Herein, we&#160;present a strategy to substantially enhance the monolayer yield by disrupting the&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonding cage confinement of multilayer MXene using high&#8208;temperature ultrasound,&#160;challenging&#160;the conventional belief that monolayer MXene can only be prepared at lower temperatures. At approximately&#160;70 &#176;C, the weakened hydrogen bonding&#160;between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules weakens&#160;the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement. This&#160;enables ultrasonic cavitation to generate more microbubbles that&#160;penetrate the interlayers of multilayer MXene,&#160;resulting&#160;in gentle and thorough delamination into larger monolayer nanosheets.&#160;Achieving up to a 95%&#160;yield in just tens of&#160;minutes,&#160;these nanosheets exhibit properties comparable&#160;to those produced&#160;by&#160;traditional ice&#8208;bath methods.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core Based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;W&#8208;03, a quasi&#8208;planar spiro&#8208;type hole&#8208;transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi&#8208;level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, those with Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 exhibit enhanced stability under N2 and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi&#8208;planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular stacking in Z&#8208;W&#8208;03. The multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular contacts of HTMs can improve the hole hopping transport. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on further molecular structure design and optimization of spiro&#8208;type HTMs incorporating quasi&#8208;planar cores and carbazole moieties for the commercialization of PSCs.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Allenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. Using racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile, this stereoconvergent reaction resulted in 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.).







Abstract
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Based PROTAC Enables Targeted Degradation of RNA Binding Protein FMRP for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PROTAC composed of G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL&#8208;33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.







Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper&#8208;expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP&#8208;targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP&#8208;targeting G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1&#8208;VHLL). Sc1&#8208;VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1&#8208;VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of Treg cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1&#8208;VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.

         <title>Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule&#8208;based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.







Abstract
Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &#951;10=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide which acts as a useful building block for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access Si=B double bonded species were synthesized by a formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a Si(0) complex. The adjacent Br group and the vacant 3p(Si) orbital serves as reaction sites toward neutral and anionic nucleophiles for late&#8208;stage electronic tuning and synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a cyclopropene.







Abstract
Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8722;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source. The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>

         <dc:description>
CoFe Prussian blue analogs are transformed into CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts via CO2 laser irradiation, achieving high NH3 production rates from electrochemical nitrate reduction with excellent stability, thereby positioning the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.







Abstract
Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8197;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47&#8197;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost&#8208;effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Intramolecular dynamic networks allow for regulation of protein function by dynamic allostery, but it has been unclear whether such networks can be positively modulated through protein&#8208;protein association. It is now shown that the formation of a protein&#8208;protein interface can motionally couple distant sites, turning preexisting structures into functional networks.







Abstract
Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#956;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.

         <title>Integration of Plasmonic Ag(I) Clusters and Fe(II) Porphyrinates into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupling with Photosynthesis of Pure H2O2</title>

Integrating Ag(I) clusters as oxidative sites and Fe porphyrinates as reductive sites into a metal&#8211;organic framework for artificial photosynthetic overall reaction to yield CO and pure 0.1&#8197;mM H2O2.







Abstract
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with the photosynthesis of pure H2O2 is a challenging and significant task. Herein, using classical CO2 photoreduction site iron porphyrinate as the linker, Ag(I) clusters were spatially separated and evenly distributed within a new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe. With water as electron donors, Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe exhibited remarkable performances in artificial photosynthetic overall reaction with CO yield of 36.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, as well as H2O2 evolution rate of 35.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Since H2O2 in the liquid phase can be more readily separated from the gaseous products of CO2 photoreduction, high&#8208;purity H2O2 with a concentration up to 0.1&#8197;mM was obtained. Confirmed by theoretical calculations and the established energy level diagram, the reductive iron(II) porphyrinates and oxidative Ag(I) clusters within an integrated framework functioned synergistically to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the robust connection of Ag(I) clusters and iron porphyrinate ligands facilitated efficient charge separation and rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type&#8201;2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD01&#8208;67 is a macrocyclic analog designed to selectively target the neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2), identified through an in&#8208;depth SAR study. Based on NT(7&#8211;12), in which Ile12 was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine, followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, this constrained peptide exerts non&#8208;opioid analgesic action and no opioid&#8208;related adverse effects, thus representing a new therapeutic option for pain management.







Abstract
The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8211;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9&#8197;nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are used to silence the activity of a payload and subsequently release this payload at a desired time and place using light irradiation. A fundamental property of PPGs crucial for their application is their efficiency of payload release, governed by the photochemical Quantum Yield (QY). Here we report a new strategy to improve the QY of PPGs through using a new sulfite self&#8208;immolative linker resulting in a five&#8208; to six&#8208;fold improved QY while simultaneously improving aqueous solubility.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages. Most importantly, it allows for spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate&#8208;based systems.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Hybrid PET/MRI Probe for Quantitative Perfusion Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the integration of PET and MRI in molecular imaging has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We have developed a hybrid PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which is exceptionally stable, rapidly synthesized, efficiently radiolabeled, and allows simultaneous PET/MR imaging. The potential for in vivo application is demonstrated by quantitative characterization of tissue and renal clearance in mice.







Abstract
Perfusion dynamics play a vital role in delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing metabolic waste products. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging. However, the development of dual PET/MRI probes has been hampered by challenging synthesis and radiolabeling. Here, we present a novel PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which exhibits excellent stability comparable to macrocyclic MRI contrast agents used in clinical practice. The unique molecular design of [18F][Gd(FL1)] allows selective and expeditious radiolabeling of the gadolinium chelate in the final synthetic step. Leveraging the strengths of MRI and PET signals, the probe enables quantitative in vivo mapping of perfusion and excretion dynamics through an innovative voxel&#8208;based analysis. The diagnostic capabilities of [18F][Gd(FL1)] were demonstrated in a pilot study on healthy mice, successfully detecting early cases of unilateral renal dysfunction, a condition that is typically challenging to diagnose. This study introduces a new approach for PET/MRI and emphasizes a streamlined probe design for practical synthesis and improved diagnostic accuracy.

Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging. However, the development of dual PET/MRI probes has been hampered by challenging synthesis and radiolabeling. Here, we present a novel PET/MRI probe, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F][Gd(&lt;b&gt;FL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;)], which exhibits excellent stability comparable to macrocyclic MRI contrast agents used in clinical practice. The unique molecular design of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F][Gd(&lt;b&gt;FL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;)] allows selective and expeditious radiolabeling of the gadolinium chelate in the final synthetic step. Leveraging the strengths of MRI and PET signals, the probe enables quantitative &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mapping of perfusion and excretion dynamics through an innovative voxel-based analysis. The diagnostic capabilities of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F][Gd(&lt;b&gt;FL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;)] were demonstrated in a pilot study on healthy mice, successfully detecting early cases of unilateral renal dysfunction, a condition that is typically challenging to diagnose. This study introduces a new approach for PET/MRI and emphasizes a streamlined probe design for practical synthesis and improved diagnostic accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation of Acyclic 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl Alkenes as Limiting Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of E/Z&#8208;alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a simple copper&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and E/Z&#8208;alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations Toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;buckybowls, spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs), are synthesized by fusing together two dichalcogenasumanenes. Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro&#8208;buckybowls: in the S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzenes in the Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 displays second&#8208;harmonic generation.







Abstract
Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed VO sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between VO and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of tune the electrocatalytic microenvironment via the introduction of C&#8722;F bonds can effectively break the scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH, and facilitate the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2, thereby resulting in significantly improving the performance of oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH)=&#916;G(*OH)+3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8722;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox approach, coupling of aryl&#8208; and alkenyl iodides with acetone cyanohydrin generates the aryl&#8208; and vinyl nitriles efficiently.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reaction by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles. Combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the crucial role of cationic silver salts in activating the stable (P,N)&#8208;AuCN complex towards the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to subsequently generate key aryl&#8208;Au(III) cyanide complexes.

         <title>Enhancing d/p&#8208;2&#960;* Orbitals Hybridization via Strain Engineering for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice strain regulates the orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics.







Abstract
The photoconversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products using solar energy is a promising strategy to address both energy and environmental challenges. However, the strongly adsorbed CO2 frequently impedes the seamless advancement of the subsequent reaction by significantly increasing the reaction activation energy. Here, we present a BiFeO3 material with lattice strain that collaboratively regulates the d/p&#8208;2&#960;* orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics. Quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculation reveals that the optimized Fe sites enhance the adsorption and activation effect of CO2, and continuous internal electrons are rapidly transferred to the reaction sites and injected into the surface *CO2 and *COOH under the condition of illumination, which promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH. Certainly, the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CO is improved by 12.81&#8208;fold compared with the base material. This work offers a new perspective for the rapid photoreduction process of strongly adsorbed CO2.

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was discovered that sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit significantly different gas evolution behavior during discharge compared to the charging gas evolution observed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries during formation. This difference primarily arises from the high specific surface area and unique porous structure of the hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries, which facilitate a specific adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior of CO2 gas.







Abstract
In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed natural killer (NK) cells were constructed for adoptive cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. The porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (NK@p&#8208;Fe) could generate active doxorubicin to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells, as well as immune agonists for activating NK cells and reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for NK cell infiltration.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, its practical application is still suffering from the decreased function and inadequate infiltration of NK cells in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Herein, we construct light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on the NK cell surface, a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities is formed. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate the active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze the production of the FDA&#8208;approved immune agonist imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role, inducing dendritic cell maturation for NK cell activation and reshaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cell infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for the modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Vertically Fluorinated Graphene Encapsulated SiOx Anode for Enhanced Li+ Transport and Interfacial Stability in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertically fluorinated graphene encapsulated SiOx anode with ultra&#8208;fast Li+ transfer and interfacial stability for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries was developed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of surface fluorination for the construction of LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interfaces.







Abstract
Achieving high energy density has always been the goal of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx has emerged as a compelling candidate for use as a negative electrode material due to its remarkable capacity. However, the huge volume expansion and the unstable electrode interface during (de)lithiation, hinder its further development. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of surface fluorinated SiOx (SiOx@vG&#8722;F), and investigate their influences on battery performance. Systematic experiments investigations indicate that the reaction between Li+ and fluorine groups promotes the in&#8197;situ formation of stable LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of SiOx@vG&#8722;F anode, which effectively suppresses the pulverization of microsized SiOx particles during the charge and discharge cycle. As a result, the SiOx@vG&#8722;F enabled a higher capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C in the SiOx@vG&#8722;F||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell. This approach will provide insights for the advancement of alternative electrode materials in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd@ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;for Photo&#8208;Assisted Cross&#8208;Couplings and CO2 to Methanol: Activity and Selectivity Insights</title>

         <dc:description>
A commercially available ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) was used to deposit palladium, demonstrating excellent performance in photocatalysis and thermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reactions under various pre&#8208;treatment conditions.







Abstract
Our study unveils a pioneering methodology that effectively distributes Pd species within a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8). We demonstrate that Pd can be encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 as atomically dispersed Pd species that function as an excited&#8208;state transition metal catalyst for promoting carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) cross&#8208;couplings at room temperature using visible light as the driving force. Furthermore, the same material can be reduced at 250&#8201;&#176;C, forming Pd metal nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst shows high rates and selectivity for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol under industrially relevant conditions (250&#8201;&#176;C, 50&#8197;bar): 7.46&#8197;molmethanol&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and &gt;99&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the correlations of the catalyst structure with the performances at experimental and theoretical levels.

         <dc:description>
Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction.

Abstract

This species has been characterized in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations are consistent with its formulation as a &#963;&#8208;complex derived from coordination of the zinc&#8211;hydride to a paramagnetic nickel(I) fragment. Continuous&#8208;wave and pulse EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution. Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D&#8208;exchange with D2 or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8722;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres.

         <title>Screening Strategy Identifies an Overlooked Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a strategy focusing on polar axial symmetry, a DUV transparent NLO crystal Mg2PO4Cl was discovered after screening over 10,000 phosphates. This crystal exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV compounds. Such a remarkable SHG effect can be attributed to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis.







Abstract
In the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) region, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals must meet stringent requirements, including a large optical band gap and sufficient second harmonic generation (SHG) response. Typically, these criteria are fulfilled by borates, carbonates and nitrates containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups. In contrast, sulfates and phosphates, with polarizabilities significantly smaller than those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, struggle to achieve similar performance. Here, we present the discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, a magnesium&#8208;based phosphate, identified from over 10,000 phosphates based on a polar&#8208;axial&#8208;symmetry screening strategy, which exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV transparent NLO crystals. This compound belongs to the Pna21 space group, with [PO4] units consistently aligned along the 21 screw axis and glide planes throughout its crystal structure. Theoretical calculations attribute its remarkable SHG effect to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis. Furthermore, a crystallographic structure analysis of phosphates and sulfates with significant SHG effects validates the effectiveness of our screening strategy. These findings offer valuable insights into the origins of NLO effects in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds from both a material design and structural chemistry perspective, inspiring future efforts to revitalize DUV phosphates.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes is reported and enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under ligand&#8208;free conditions. Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles is achieved with chiral bisoxazoline ligands, providing access to &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.







Abstract
C(sp3) centers adjacent to (hetero) aryl groups are widely present in physiologically active molecules. Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkenes represents an efficient means of forging C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, boasting advantages as a wide source of substrates, mild reaction conditions, and facile selectivity manipulation. Nevertheless, the hydroalkylation of vinylarenes encounters constraints in terms of substrate scope, necessitating the employment of activated alkyl halides or alkenes containing chelating groups, remains a challenge. In this context, we report a general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes. Remarkably, this system enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under an extra ligand&#8208;free condition, demonstrating excellent coupling efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, through the incorporation of chiral bisoxazoline ligands, we have achieved regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.

         <title>Unraveling the Anionic Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; uptake/release in the aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries is firstly deciphered; together with the Mn redox reaction accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, the tailored manganese deficient MnO2 cathode with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; achieves an ultrahigh energy density and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability.







Abstract
Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra&#8208;capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO2&#8208;based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO2 micro&#8208;nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; (CaMnO&#8208;140) are prepared via a low&#8208;temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non&#8208;bonding O 2p states, the pre&#8208;intercalated Ca2+ can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na-ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra-capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; micro-nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-pillars&#8221; (CaMnO-140) are prepared via a low-temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non-bonding O 2p states, the pre-intercalated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations. The tailored CaMnO-140 cathode demonstrates an unprecedentedly high rate capability (485.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 154.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a marvelous long-term cycling durability (90.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 5000&#8197;cycles) in AZIBs. The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (from the electrolyte) uptake/release, and the manganese redox accompanied by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; co-insertion/extraction, are elucidated by advanced synchrotron characterizations and theoretical computations. Finally, pouch-type CaMnO-140//Zn batteries manifest bright application prospects with high energy, long life, wide-temperature adaptability, and high operating safety. This study provides new perspectives for developing high-energy cathodes for AZIBs by initiating anionic redox chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Regulation of the Reverse Intersystem Crossing Pathway by Hybridized Long&#8208;Short Axis Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules have experienced great success in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their outstanding quantum efficiencies and narrow full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs). However, the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, which will lead to relatively long triplet exciton lifetime and severe efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, we report an effective molecular design strategy to introduce multichannel RISC pathways and thus increase RISC rates without compromising the color fidelity and emission efficiency by the &#8220;hybridized long&#8208;short axis (HLSA)&#8221; strategy. The TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, rapid RISC rate of 1.4 &#215; 105 s&#8208;1, narrow FWHM of 23 nm, and small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.06 eV in solution. The non&#8208;sensitized OLED based on TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN exhibits a narrowband emission with the FWHM of 31 nm, in company with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.9%. Notably, the device exhibits the low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain 34.8% and 21.8% at 100 and 1000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively, representing the best performance for single&#8208;host OLEDs based on the BCzBN skeleton. This study provides a fresh and promising approach to realize high&#8208;performance OLEDs with high color purity and remarkable device efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Activatable Copper Nanoplatforms Synergize with the 5&#8208;Azacytidine Prodrug to Potentiate Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T&#8208;cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc&#8208;AzaC) and 808 nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR&#8208;controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image&#8208;guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The diborylation of the N=N double bond of azoarenes has been achieved using a commercially available diboron reagent, B2cat2 [bis(catecholato)diboron]. By utilizing the photo&#8208;switchable nature of azoarenes under blue&#8208;LED light irradiation, an uncatalyzed diborylation and silaboration yielded a broad range of functionalized hydrazine derivatives. The mechanistic origin validates the importance of cis configuration, which is corroborated by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>AdvancedEutectogel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance and Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite ongoing challenges, achieving further breakthroughs in the development of gel polymer electrolytes with a wide temperature range, excellent liquid retention capability and enhanced anode compatibility in flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) remains a significant objective. This study presents a significant advancement in the development of choline chloride/ethylene glycol&#8208;polyvinyl alcohol (ChCl/EG&#8208;PVA) eutectogel electrolyte, tailored for high&#8208;performance operation across a wide temperature range. Systematic in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm the formation of robust hydrogen bonding and denser polymer cross&#8208;linked networks within the prepared eutectogel, leading to enhanced liquid retention ability (93.7% after 96 h exposure to air) and the ion transport capacity (ionic conductivity of 171.3 mS cm&#8208;1). Additionally, the zincophilicity nature of the choline cation in eutectogel effectively suppresses dendrites growth. The assembled FZAB utilizing this eutectogel electrolyte achieves a peak power density of 109.3 mW cm&#8208;2 and a cycle life of 90 h. Notably, the power density of FZAB is maintained as high as 38.2 mW cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;40 oC and 63.2 mW cm&#8208;2 at 50 oC, demonstrating its prominent suitability for applications in extreme temperature conditions. The design of eutectogel provides a novel way to achieve the high&#8208;performance FZAB.</dc:description>

         <title>Actuation Performance and Versatility of Photothermally Driven Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomechanical crystals exhibit mechanical motion upon light irradiation and may thus find applications as actuators. Over the last decades, many photomechanical organic crystals have been developed, commonly via photochemical reactions, particularly photoisomerization. However, photochemical crystal actuation is associated with several drawbacks, including a limited number of available crystals, slow actuation speed (&lt; 5 Hz), and narrow wavelength range (&lt; 550 nm). Such constraints have hindered the widespread use of crystals as actuation materials. In this minireview, we focus on crystal actuation by employing more universal physical phenomena (the photothermal effect and photothermally resonated natural vibration) and quantitatively evaluate actuation performance. Both mechanisms, particularly the latter, outperformed conventional photomechanical crystal activation in terms of both speed (maximum: 1,350 Hz) and the useful wavelength range (ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared). The oscillation frequencies of the crystals exceeded those of polymers, efficiently filling the gap between soft and hard materials. Both the photothermal effect and natural vibration can actuate any crystal that absorbs light. These two versatile physical actuation mechanisms could expand 40 years of research on photomechanical crystals&#8212;which had been based on photochemical reactions&#8212;from the realm of chemistry into engineering and lead to their practical applications in actuators and soft robots.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photomechanical crystals exhibit mechanical motion upon light irradiation and may thus find applications as actuators. Over the last decades, many photomechanical organic crystals have been developed, commonly via photochemical reactions, particularly photoisomerization. However, photochemical crystal actuation is associated with several drawbacks, including a limited number of available crystals, slow actuation speed (&amp;lt; 5 Hz), and narrow wavelength range (&amp;lt; 550 nm). Such constraints have hindered the widespread use of crystals as actuation materials. In this minireview, we focus on crystal actuation by employing more universal physical phenomena (the photothermal effect and photothermally resonated natural vibration) and quantitatively evaluate actuation performance. Both mechanisms, particularly the latter, outperformed conventional photomechanical crystal activation in terms of both speed (maximum: 1,350 Hz) and the useful wavelength range (ultraviolet to near-infrared).

         <title>Arenicolide Family Macrolides Provide a New Therapeutic Lead Combating Multidrug&#8208;resistant Tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) and extensively drug&#8208;resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) poses a significant threat to health globally. During searching for new chemical entities regulating MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb, chemical investigation of the black oil beetle gut bacterium Micromonospora sp. GR10 led to the discovery of eight new members of arenicolides along with the identification of arenicolide A (Ar&#8208;A, 1), which was a previously reported macrolide with incomplete configuration. Genomic analysis of the bacterial strain GR10 revealed their putative biosynthetic pathway. Quantum mechanics&#8208;based computation, chemical derivatizations, and bioinformatic analysis established the absolute stereochemistry of Ar&#8208;A and arenicolides D&#8208;K (Ar&#8208;D&#8208;K, 2&#8208;9) completely for the first time. Biological studies of 1&#8208;9 revealed their antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR strains of Mtb. Ar&#8208;A had the most potent in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb. Mechanistically, Ar&#8208;A induced ATP depletion and destabilized Mtb cell wall, thereby inhibiting growth. Notably, Ar&#8208;A exerted a significant antimicrobial effect against Mtb in macrophages, was effective in the treatment of Mtb infections, and showed a synergistic effect with amikacin (AMK) in a mouse model of MDR&#8208;Mtb lung infection. Collectively, our findings indicate Ar&#8208;A to be a promising drug lead for drug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unclicking the Click: A Depolymerizable Clicked Polymer via Two Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a clicked polymer that can be depolymerized by a declicking reaction. A designed dipeptide monomer, upon heating its crystals, underwent a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition polymerization to form a triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, which upon further heating, underwent a remarkable SCSC denitrogenation, resulting in an imine&#8208;linked polymer quantitatively. As both the TEAC polymerization and the denitrogenation occurred in SCSC fashion, the structures of the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer and the imine&#8208;linked polymer could be determined at atomic resolution by SCXRD. Acid hydrolysis of the imine&#8208;linked polymer leads to quantitative depolymerization yielding a dipeptide, showcasing the degradability and depolymerizability of such polymers. This solid&#8208;state click polymerization and denitrogenation yielding depolymerizable polymer is attractive over the usual click polymers that cannot be unclicked.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Redox Environment Determines Cancer&#8208;normal Cell Selectivity of Selenium Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating the chemical structure and intracellular action mechanisms is still the critical limit for the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Intracellular redox environments originating from cell metabolism are key factors affecting internalized drug efficacy. Herein, we engineer Se&#8208;Se/Se&#8208;S bond to assemble selenium nanoclusters with intracellular redox environment&#8208;driven selective structure. Chemical structure analysis reveals that, the bonding of sulfur atom in intermediates to the two neighboring or interposition selenium atoms in selenium rings is the key internal driving force for nanoparticle cluster formation. This nanocluster can be predominantly transformed to selenocysteine to facilitate selenoproteins synthesis in normal cells, while metabolize to cytotoxic SeO32&#8208; based on the oxidative intracellular redox environment of cancer cells. Resultantly, selenium nanoclusters exhibit significant cell proliferation inhibition ability to cancer cells and impressive safety to normal cells. Taken together, this study not only clarifies the chemical nature of the atom engineering of selenium nanocluster, but also elucidates its intracellular redox environment&#8208;oriented anticancer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanical Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Stiffens Tumor Cells to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor progression is associated with tumor&#8208;cell softening. Improving the stiffness of the tumor cells can make them more vulnerable to lymphocyte&#8208;mediated attack. Tumor cell membranes typically exhibit higher cholesterol levels than normal cells, making tumor cells soft. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI) formulated by cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids. Through fusing CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane using a fusogenic liposome formulation, the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is reduced due to the specific host&#8211;guest interactions between CD lipid and cholesterol. As a result, tumor cells are stiffened, and the activation of lymphocytes (including NK and cytotoxic effector T cells) is improved when contacting the stiffened tumor cells, characterized by robust degranulation and effector cytokine production. Notably, this treatment has negligible influence on the infiltration and proliferation of lymphocytes in tumor tissues, confirming that the enhanced antitumor efficacy should result from activating a specific number of lymphocytes caused by direct regulation of the tumor cell stiffness. The combination of MICIs and clinical immunotherapies enhances the lymphocyte&#8208;mediated antitumor effects in two tumor mouse models, including breast cancer and melanoma. Our research also reveals an unappreciated mechanical dimension to lymphocyte activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Crucial of Spatial Al Distribution to Realize Precise Alkali&#8208;Treatment for Target Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing mesoporous structure within zeolites by alkali&#8208;treatment is an effective protocol to improve their diffusion properties. However, undesirable changes in Br&#246;nsted acid site (BAS) densities always offset this advantage in acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In this context, the crucial roles of spatial aluminum&#160;distribution were unraveled during alkali&#8208;treatment of MFI zeolite and the desirable BAS density was achieved in obtained hierarchical samples for the target reactions. Various characterization methods, particularly the multiple one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning (MAS) NMR techniques, were performed to track the alkali&#8208;treatment processes. For the sample with a more uniform spatial Al distribution, more tetrahedral Al sites would fall off and migrate around the Si&#8208;OH in zeolite as Al(OH)4&#8208;. Those re&#8208;deposited Al(OH)4&#8208; sites were easily transformed into NMR&#8208;invisible Al sites during the calcination process, which contributed negligibly to both Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acidities, thus being referred to&#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221;Al species. While most tetrahedral Al sites were preserved after the alkali&#8208;treatment of sample with non&#8208;uniform Al distribution and the BAS density gradually increased with treatment time. According to the requirements of typical acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as catalytic cracking of 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene and methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins, the desired hierarchical zeolite catalysts were developed by matching the amounts of extracted Si and generated&#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221;Al during the precise alkali&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Molecular&#8208;Level Biological Monitoring with a Smart Self&#8208;Assembling 19F&#8208;Labeled Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time monitoring of molecular transformations is crucial for advancements in biotechnology. In this study, we introduce a novel self&#8208;assembling 19F&#8208;labeled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe that disassembles upon interaction with various nucleotides. This interaction not only activates the 19F signals but also produces distinct signatures for each specific component, thereby enabling precise identification and quantification of molecules in evolving samples. We demonstrate the capability of this probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and screening potential enzyme inhibitors. These applications highlight the probe's significant potential in enzyme analysis, drug development, and disease diagnostics.</dc:description>

This interaction not only activates the 19F signals but also produces distinct signatures for each specific component, thereby enabling precise identification and quantification of molecules in evolving samples. We demonstrate the capability of this probe for real-time monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and screening potential enzyme inhibitors. These applications highlight the probe's significant potential in enzyme analysis, drug development, and disease diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Amination of Benzyl Alcohols: Selectivity Independent of Side Substituents</title>

A photocatalytic para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of benzyl alcohols whose reactivity and site selectivity are independent of existing side substituents is disclosed.







Abstract
Aminoarenes are important molecules for broad applications in nearly all modern industries that involve chemicals. Direct and site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond amination of arenes provides the most efficient and convenient method to prepare aminoarenes. A main challenge is to selectively install the amino group (or other functional groups) to the distal para&#8208;carbon of arenes (especially multi&#8208;substituted arenes) during the C&#8722;H bond functionalization events. Herein, we address this problem by designing a new strategy via a sequential radical dearomatization/radical amination/rearomatization process for para&#8208;selective amination of benzyl alcohols. The para&#8208;selectivity of our reaction is completely independent of the electronic and steric properties of the other substituents of the arene substrates. Aminoarenes with many substituents (up to full substitution) and diverse substitution patterns, including those difficult to synthesize previously, could be readily prepared using our protocols. Further exploration of the current strategy shall lead to other challenging C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

         <title>In vivo Metabolic Sensing of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Mice Using a Recyclable Perfluorinated Iridium Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarization enhances pyruvate signal, enabling real&#8208;time metabolic flux monitoring by MRI. Our study presents a novel method, achieving a 22% increase in hyperpolarized in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate's enhancement using Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with a perfluorinated Iridium catalyst in a fluorinated solvent/methanol blend. This catalyst enables easy separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and allowing in vivo metabolic sensing in human pancreatic xenografts.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non&#8208;invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost&#8208;effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 1.2&#8208;fold increase in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE&#8208;SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10&#8197;cycles, with a 3.3&#8208;fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study encourages wider adoption of SABRE hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate MR for studying in vivo metabolism, aiding in diagnosing stages and monitoring treatment responses in cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

         <title>C&#8722;S&#8208;Selective Stille&#8208;Coupling Enables Stereodefined Alkene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described, which provides an expedient route to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive manifold.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8722;H thianthrenation and C&#8722;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8722;S over C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8722;OTf), tosylates (C&#8722;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8722;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity. Modular installation of stereospecific alkene motifs into pharmaceuticals illustrated the synthetic application of the present protocol in drug discovery.

         <title>Deciphering Pauling's Third Rule: Uncovering Strong Anharmonicity and Exceptionally Low Thermal Conductivity in TlAgSe for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can provide structural instability required to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. TlAgSe shows low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance due to strong anharmonicity and correlated atomic rattling because of Pauling's third rule.







Abstract
The elucidation of chemical bonding, coupled with an exploration of the correlated dynamics of constituent atoms, is essential for unravelling the underlying mechanism responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) exhibited by a crystalline solid, which is essential for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. In this regard, Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can bring about the lattice instability required to suppress the &#954;L. Here, we demonstrate the presence of such instability in a ternary selenide, TlAgSe, leading to a ultra&#8208;low &#954;L of 0.17&#8197;W/m.K at 573&#8197;K. Our study reveals the instability arising from Ag&#8722;Ag repulsion within edge&#8208;shared AgSe4 tetrahedra through investigation of the local structure using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and supported by first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations. We observe correlation between weakening in the Ag and the Tl&#8208;sublattice, providing direct experimental evidence of Pauling's third empirical rule. The correlated rattling of Ag and Tl induces a highly anharmonic lattice and low energy optical phonons, resulting in suppressed sound velocity and ultralow &#954;L in TlAgSe. The electronic origin of soft and anharmonic lattice is the presence of filled antibonding states in the valence band near the Fermi level constructed by Ag(4d)&#8722;Se(4p) and Tl(6s)&#8722;Se(4p) interactions. This work demonstrates that the evidence of dynamic distortion in a crystal lattice is governed by the third empirical rule given by Pauling, which can act as a potential new strategy for diminishing &#954;L in crystalline solids.

         <title>Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI2 can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI2 in reacting with oxygen through the Alder&#8208;ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Scalable and Sustainable Zinc (II) Ions&#8208;Glue&#8208;Assisted Conversion of Biomass Waste Bits into Carbon Aerogels for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a new strategy for carbon aerogel generation by cross&#8208;linking biomass bits with zinc ionic glue. Zn2+ ions as the glue cleavage cellulose hydrogen bonds of natural biomass, then facilitate dehydration crosslinking reaction between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for re&#8208;constructing the whole block structure. This strategy provides a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective way for large&#8208;scale preparation and application of aerogel materials, which will open up a range of applications relevant to extraction separation, catalysis, insulation, and other fields.







Abstract
Carbon aerogels (CAs) have garnered significant attention due to their multifunctional applications. Biomass waste, abundantly generated by agriculture and industry, serves as a primary carbon source. However, developing a facile, sustainable, and efficient method to produce CAs from biomass waste remains challenging. In this study, a one&#8208;step Zn2+ ion&#8208;glue&#8208;assisted carbonization technique was developed to produce large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance CAs. Various biomass materials (wood bits, peanut shells, bamboo bits, and straw waste) were treated in a molten salt system (ZnCl2/KCl) at 300&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h to obtain large&#8208;block CAs derived from biomass bits. Zn2+ ions cleave cellulose hydrogen bonds in natural biomass, facilitating the dehydration crosslinking reaction among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, thus reconstructing the entire block structure. The resulting CAs exhibited high porosity (95&#8201;%) and low density (0.078&#8197;g/cm3). Numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were preserved during the low&#8208;temperature treatment, facilitating chemical modification for diverse applications. For instance, amidoxime functionalized CAs were utilized as filters for selective and highly efficient extraction of U(VI) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;103&#8197;L/m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocaged epothilone has been developed to fill the unmet need for a high&#8208;performance optically triggered microtubule (MT) stabiliser. A one&#8208;pot synthesis from commercial epothilone delivered CouEpo, whose 100&#8208;fold bioactivity turn&#8208;on upon visible&#8208;light photouncaging led to sub&#8208;nanomolar potency, allowing high spatial and temporal resolution control of MT structure and dynamics in live cells during GFP imaging.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon irradiation by violet/blue light to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway of glucoside conversion in four steps is widely conserved in bacteria and is encoded from a discrete genomic locus (GUL). The GUL pathways involve metallocenter lyases that cleave C3&#8208;oxidized glucosides with broad specificity and hydrate the resulting glycal elimination product. The structural and mechanistic basis for these reactions is presented, and GUL genomic diversity in bacteria is explored.







Abstract
The flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+ metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+ metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (&#945;) anomeric configuration as preferred by the A. tumefaciens enzyme (&#946;). Structural and biochemical comparisons reveal the molecular&#8208;mechanistic origin of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucoside lyase stereo&#8208;complementarity. Our findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in the bacterial domain of life.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Silylene&#8208;Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis&#8208;silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si2Al2 heterocycle. In the presence of Fe0, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative AlI&#8594;Fe0 type complex. The Fe0&#8208;aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated Fe0 complex.







Abstract
The suitability of electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;silylenes, specifically the neutral chelating [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si, Xant=9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and the anionic [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]&#8722; pincer ligand (NAcrid=2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethylacridane), has been successfully probed to stabilize monovalent bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;supported aluminium complexes (aluminylenes). At first, the unprecedented aluminium(III) iodide precursors [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlI2+ I&#8722; 1 and [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]AlI2 2 were synthesized using AlI3 and [SiII(Xant)SiII] or [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Li(OEt2)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of 1 with KC8 led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of 2 afforded the dimer of the desired {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} aluminylene with a four&#8208;membered SiIV2AlIII2 ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlII and {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of 1 and 2 with Collman's reagent, K2Fe(CO)4, and trapped as AlI:&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complexes 5 and 6, respectively. While 6 is stable in solution, 5 loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated iron(0) complex 7 from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry. In the present study, we investigated such processes in the solid state under mechanochemical conditions using the formation of racemic phases upon reacting enantiopure entities as example. As test systems, &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA) and the amino acids serine and alanine were used. The effects of ball&#8208;milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre&#8208;milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.

The effects of ball-milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre-milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

         <title>An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High&#8208;Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high&#8208;entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt&#8208;based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO2 supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO2 (23.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a high&#8208;entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high&#8208;entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&#8722;1 during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (23.5&#8197;mol&lt;sub&gt;C3H6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In a high-entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high-entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high-entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Perylene&#8208;Diimide Polymer as Universal Cathode Interlayer for Conventional, Inverted, and Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

A non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymer PPDINN was designed and synthesized by utilizing oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) as linkage, exhibiting pronounced n&#8208;doping effect, improved film&#8208;forming ability and good solvent resistance of the polymer film. By using PPDINN as cathode interlayer, excellent photovoltaic performances were achieved in conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells.







Abstract
As a class of predominantly used cathode interlayers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI)&#8208;based polymers exhibit intriguing characteristics of excellent charge transporting capacity and suitable energy levels. Despite that, PDI&#8208;based CILs with satisfied film&#8208;forming ability and adequate solvent resistance are rather rare, which not only limits the further advance of OSC performances but also hinders the practical use of PDI CILs. Herein, we designed and synthesized two non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymers for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in diverse types of OSCs. The utilization of oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkage enhanced the n&#8208;doping effect of PDI polymers, leading to an improved ability of the CIL to reduce work function and improve electron transporting capability. Moreover, the introduction of the non&#8208;ionic OEG chain effectively improve the wetting property and solvent resistance of PDI polymers, so the PPDINN CIL can withstand diverse processing conditions in fabricating different OSCs, including conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated devices. The binary OSC with conventional structure using PPDINN CIL showed a PCE of 18.6&#8201;%, along with an improved device stability. Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1&#8208;cm2 OSC where a blade&#8208;coated PPDINN was used.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular Duplexes Displaying Duplex&#8208;to&#8208;Duplex Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular duplexes stabilized by up to 10 hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs between indolocarbazole and pyridine units have been investigated. In the presence of water, these duplexes transform into hydrated duplexes with water molecules inserted into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing manner. The two distinct forms can be reversibly switched through temperature changes, with characteristic signals observed spectroscopically.







Abstract
Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole&#8211;pyridine (I&#8722;P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8800;=22.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium doping significantly boosts both the capacity and structural stability of MnO2 as the cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that this improvement results from reduced interaction between Zn2+ ions and the MnO2 host, as well as increased interaction between H+ ions and MnO2. These factors alleviate lattice strain during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation and suppress the formation of the ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;product. Moreover, modified Mn&#8722;O bond lengths upon Zn2+ insertion help alleviate Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, easing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion.







Abstract
MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8722;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8722;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8722;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8&#8197;at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

This study provides a powerful yet straightforward way to regulate the internal composition and structure of a single calcite crystal, generating a series of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials where the organic additives are preferentially distributed within specific regions of the inorganic host crystals.







Abstract
Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite advances in cancer therapies, effective screening tools that a priori predict treatment efficacy remain underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy to evaluate metabolic changes at the single cell level in response to cytostatic inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Classical machine learning approaches applied to Raman data allowed for the differentiation of responders and nonresponders of treatment and a scoring model that could be generalized to new treatment combinations.







Abstract
Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25&#8201;% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of isolated states and J&#8208;aggregate states in a single&#8208;phosphor&#8208;doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual&#8208;mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two&#8208;step temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color with excitation&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsiveness.







Abstract
The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of the isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides an excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to a hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96&#8201;% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.

         <title>Interface Engineering via Manipulating Solvation Chemistry for Liquid Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C</title>

         <dc:description>
A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance, can operate at temperatures &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1&#8201;% after 500 cycles and 93.5&#8201;% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3&#8197;V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9&#8201;% at temperature as high as 120&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero-interphase, composed of gradient F, B-rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si-rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance and temperature-resistant lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &amp;gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero-interphase, composed of gradient F, B-rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si-rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high-temperature electrochemical performance. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low-temperature performance, can operate at temperatures &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1&#8201;% after 500 cycles and 93.5&#8201;% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Ah-level LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||graphite full cells with a cut-off voltage of 4.3&#8197;V also exhibited superior temperature-resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9&#8201;% at temperature as high as 120&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Placed at an appropriate and controlled distance from the paramagnetic Mn2+ ion, 19F atoms in MnL1 experience adequate acceleration of their longitudinal relaxation, while the line&#8208;broadening effect remains moderate. This allows for efficient visualization of this small paramagnetic complex both in 19F and 1H MRI, also in the living mouse.







Abstract
We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8722;F distance (rMnF=8.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285&#8197;h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4&#8197;T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1=5.36&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.

         <title>Extremely Active and Robust Ir&#8722;Mn Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Radical Coupling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is rationally designed by the cation exchange method featuring self&#8208;limitation in the precise control over the composition and structure. The short atomic distance and the short&#8208;range cationic order of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enable the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O radicals, promoting an effective oxygen evolution reaction via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A novel Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41&#8197;&#197;) than the Mn&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49&#8197;&#197;). The modulated Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2 via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermodynamics descriptor, separation factor of solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) for designing desirable SEI chemistry, is established on the energy of Li+ diffusion (&#916;VLi), electron tunneling (&#934;e), solvent adsorption (Es), and desolvation processes (&#916;Ed), and thus the kinetic stability of charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and mass (solvent) deprivation through SEI layer at low temperatures could be quantitatively evaluated.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8722; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese&#8208;enriched O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.







Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Zr&#8208;MOF, constructed from a conventional chelated diphosphine ligand underwent post&#8208;modification to afford a monophosphine Rh catalyst, which display exceptionally high regioselectivity, reactivity and recyclability in hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins at room temperature and pressure. The structural transformation of the reactive Rh species within the framework during catalysis is elucidated through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8212;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic borane was introduced into the secondary coordination sphere of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) copper complexes, including a cuprous hydride. In contrast to non&#8208;tethered borane capped copper hydrides, the borane&#8208;tethered variant exhibits strong hydricity, attributed to relief of ring&#8208;strain, and improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular arrangement in crystals can in general be used reliably to predict the product of a topochemical reaction. When there is sufficient free&#8208;space and flexibility, molecules in crystal can make large motions prior to topochemical reaction leading to a different arrangement and yield unexpected products. Our results cautions that the prediction of product structures based on the crystal structure can be misleading.







Abstract
A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6&#8197;&#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer. Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt's topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating, the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct. Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gels (dt&#8208;SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt&#8208;SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt&#8208;SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.







Abstract
The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gel networks (dt&#8208;SRGs). In this study, a photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal&#8208;templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt&#8208;SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt&#8208;SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt&#8208;SRGs could be altered by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The COF with electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) near the active site exhibited superior CO2RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). The COF with electron-donating group (&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) near the active site exhibited superior CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron-withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) is an effective way of converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into value-added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single-atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push-pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron-donating group (&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron-withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8722;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the non&#8208;*CO adsorption on Ag surface or over&#8208;strong *CO adsorption on multiple Pd atoms, the single Pd atoms surrounded with multiple Ag sites (denoted as the Pd&#8722;Agn structure) in the Pd1Ag10 catalyst allow to tune the *CO adsorption behavior to promote the *CO surface coverage, and enable efficient C&#8722;C coupling between a Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and a Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) adsorption sites.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8722;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37&#8201;% at &#8722;0.83&#8197;V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts were established in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11 zeolites via strategically integrating operando UV/Visible spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and controlled catalytic experiments. This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>A Highly Stable and Non&#8208;Flammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)-based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;-hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next-generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)-based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;-hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long-term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN-based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

         <dc:description>
Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols via asymmetric Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylation creates axially chiral allylboranes in high enantiomeric ratio for both enantiomers. The axial&#8208;to&#8208;chiral transfer is possible through diastereoconvergent allylation with aldehydes, proving the preference for the same diastereoisomeric homoallylic alcohol, creating two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymemtric center with stereoretention for both enantiomers.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic borylation of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ols renders axially chiral allylborane systems, with high asymmetric induction for both enantiomers, by precise selection of the cis or trans substrate. The enantioenriched alkylidenecyclobutanes served as chiral platform to prove the conceptually challenging transference of the axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality through two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymmetric carbon generated via diastereoconvergent allylation of aldehydes, without enantioselective erosion.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoreactor of single&#8208;atom Mn supported on N&#8208;doped carbon is constructed over MoS2 nanosheets. It facilitates the reversible conversion of MoS2 during sodium storage by not only confining the volume change and agglomeration of discharge products but also providing catalytic Mn&#8722;N4 sites for the charging process.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65&#8201;% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In situ/ex situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier. As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self&#8208;healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance material for efficient gas separation.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO2/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO2/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO2 permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high&#8208;performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine&#8208;Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning models trained on mechanistic datasets created using expert reaction templates demonstrate the ability to successfully predict known reaction mechanisms. This study illustrates how such mechanistic models can explain how reaction outcomes are produced, recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents, and suggest potential side products and impurities.







Abstract
Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184&#8197;elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission.

     alt="Near-Full-Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible-Light Region"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-full -spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full-spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP-PL emissions and high-pressure phase transitions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full-spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near-full-spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single-component two-dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (ETA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=(HO)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), is reported, achieved through high-pressure treatment. A pressure-induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red-shifted PL emissions, leading to the near-full-spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed Crystalline Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Built&#8208;in Heterojunction Structures towards Efficient Photocatalytic Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>

A mixed crystalline m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 constructed by PHI network and internally embedded phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine framework (CHF&#8722;Ph) is synthesized via an in situ strategy. PHI and CHF&#8722;Ph form built&#8208;in type II heterojunction, and m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 has smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI. The hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic formic acid dehydrogenation reaches a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses most of the other organic photocatalysts.







Abstract
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) are widely utilized in the recent years as potential photocatalysts. However, their limited conjugated structures, low crystallinity and small surface areas have restricted the practical photocatalysis performance. Along this line, we report herein the synthesis of a kind of mixed crystalline CHF (m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1) with built&#8208;in heterojunction structure, which can efficiently catalyze the formic acid dehydrogenation by visible light driven photocatalysis. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is synthesized from 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine and dicyanobenzene (DCB) in the molten salts, in which DCB plays as organic molten co&#8208;solvent to promote the rapid and ordered polymerization of 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is formed by embedding phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine (CHF&#8722;Ph) units in the poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) network similar to doping. The CHF&#8722;Ph combined with PHI form an effective type II heterojunction structure, which promote the directional transfer of charge carriers. And the integration of CHF&#8722;Ph makes m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 have smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI, the charge carriers are more easily dissociated to form free electrons, resulting in higher utilization efficiency of the carriers. The largest hydrogen evolution rate reaches a value of 42.86&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses the majority of other organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine&#8208;sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiOx HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large&#8208;area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm2 with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.

         <title>Non&#8208;Isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;isocyanate synthetic pathway for dynamic hindered urea bonds was demonstrated using a ring&#8208;opening reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;di(piperidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)propane. The resulting thiol groups formed covalent adaptable networks (CANs) via click reactions. These CANs can be selectively controlled by activating each dynamic bond, providing multiple pathways for reprocessing, chemical recycling, and reutilization.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of four-membered ring-embedded cycloarene &lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti-aromaticity and ultra-narrowband emission with a single-digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra-narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of fully fused &#960;-conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four-membered ring-embedded cycloarene (&lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt;) was designed and synthesized in single-crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond-linked chiral macrocycle &lt;b&gt;MS2&lt;/b&gt; without two fused four-membered rings and its linear-shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; were also synthesized. The pronounced anti-aromaticity of four-membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;MS2&lt;/b&gt;, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt;, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti-aromatic four-membered rings that reduce structural displacements, &lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an ultra-narrowband emission with a single-digit full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra-narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Soft, Fatigue&#8208;free, and Self&#8208;healable Ionic Elastomer via the Synergy of Skin&#8208;like Assembly and Bouligand Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of skin&#8208;like functional properties (softness, strain stiffening, self&#8208;healing, and stretchability) together with ultra&#8208;high fracture toughness and fatigue resistance are realized by fusing a unique structural&#8208;compositional design involving dermal binary assembly and Bouligand structure.







Abstract
Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&#8722;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>A General Copper&#8208;Box System for the Asymmetric Arylative Functionalization of Benzylic, Propargylic or Allenylic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;Box system was reported for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved arylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to access valuable aryl&#8208;substituted motifs. However, there still exist several challenges such as limited scope of radical precursors/acceptors, and lack of general asymmetric catalytic systems, especially regarding the multicomponent variants. Herein, we reported a general copper&#8208;Box system for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies imply that the copper/Box complexes play a dual role in both radical generation and ensuing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. In the cases of 1,3&#8208;enynes, visible&#8208;light irradiation could improve the activity of copper/Box complex toward the initial radical generation, enabling better efficiency match between radical formation and cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Zwitterionic Acridinium Amidate: A Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Catalyst for Photoinduced Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited&#8208;state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d-HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen-centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited-state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen-bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, and I) was developed by dissecting exciton dynamics, which could be specifically activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) upon 808&#8197;nm laser excitation, enabling fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging&#8208;escorted efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934; 1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808&#8197;nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in &#934; 1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808&#8197;nm laser power density (0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three&#8208;electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization.

     alt="Copper-Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example of ligand-controlled, copper-catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand-controlled regio- and stereoselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We herein describe the first example of ligand-controlled, copper-catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-DTBM-Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1-difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;)-Ph-BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2-difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1-difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&amp;gt;150&#8197;examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late-stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol&#8197;A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand-controlled regio- and stereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Migratory Hydroamidocarbonylation of Amide&#8208;Linked Alkenes to Access Chiral &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Succinimides</title>

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes to access chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides was developed. The key to success was adopting P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand featured with bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes was developed, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. The key to success was introducing bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group into the rigid P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket. By this approach, regio&#8208; or stereo&#8208;convergent synthesis of enantiomeric succinimides from the mixture of olefin isomers was achieved.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Extended Resorcin[4]arenes: Synthesis and Highly Efficient Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of synthetic macrocycles, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), were designed and synthesized. By incorporating unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold, ExR4 exhibited a flexible backbone. Most importantly, ExR4 displayed remarkable potential in constructing adsorptive materials for iodine capture.







Abstract
The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted &#8220;Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8221; shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives.

     alt="Closed-Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room-Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polymer-to-monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene-based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo-DCv-LCN) is reported. The Azo-DCv-LCN can be programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo-DCv-LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv-LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv-LCNs are still limited to heat-assisted programming and polymer-to-polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene-based DCv-LCN with room-temperature programmability and polymer-to-monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene-containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water-activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv-LCN can be simply programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv-LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid-solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv-LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shear&#8208;Strained Pd Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd single atoms suspended on interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed by dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were synthesized through low&#8208;temperature heat treatment. Pd&#8722;CuO introduces the dynamic effects of shear stress and carrier formation into Pd single atoms on dislocations, which can promote water activation and facilitate the hydrogenation of nitrate ions to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield of 4.2&#8197;mol.&#8201;gcat&#8722;1.&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90&#8201;% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.

Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

An organic zwitterion comprising an acridinium cation and an amidate anion directly linked by an N&#8211;N bond was developed by Takeshi Yanai, Olga Garc&#237;a Manche&#241;o, Kohsuke Ohmatsu, Takashi Ooi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404890). With the aid of hexafluoroisopropanol as a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, this zwitterion acts as a trifunctional photocatalyst to achieve efficient functionalization of inert aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds with electron&#8208;deficient olefins under blue&#8208;light irradiation by sequentially engaging in the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, single&#8208;electron reduction, and proton transfer.

A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries , additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

         <title>Artificial Polymerizations in Living Organisms for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review starts with a discussion on the diversity of artificial polymerizations, including those triggered by exogenous and endogenous stimuli, as well as those that occur spontaneously. The review also systematically summarizes the biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization including but not limited to safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.







Abstract
Within living organisms, numerous nanomachines are constantly involved in complex polymerization processes, generating a diverse array of biomacromolecules for maintaining biological activities. Transporting artificial polymerizations from lab settings into biological contexts has expanded opportunities for understanding and managing biological events, creating novel cellular compartments, and introducing new functionalities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in artificial polymerizations, including those responding to external stimuli, internal environmental factors, and those that polymerize spontaneously. More importantly, the cutting&#8208;edge biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization, notably in safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and facilitating therapeutic efficacy are highlighted. Finally, this review outlines the key challenges and technological obstacles that remain for polymerizations in biological organisms, as well as offers insights into potential directions for advancing their practical applications and clinical trials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light&#8208;driven and temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.







Abstract
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non&#8208;local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8722;N5 Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

Through the innovative design of a molten salt method, an axial N traction strategy is developed to reduce the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and achieve precise regulation of the atom. The prepared FeN5@DNC material can regulate the formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity and high current density of 99&#8201;%, and running stably in both flow cell and Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with good performance. It provides a new way to realize the precise regulation of M&#8208;NC catalyst materials.







Abstract
Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5 sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99&#8201;% for CO production (&#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% at a current density of 270&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24&#8197;hours. In situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographically characterized Pr4+ imidophosphorane complex is presented, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (where tBu=C(CH3)3), which exhibits a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry in the solid state. The complex exhibits remarkable thermal stability, facilitating rigorous physical characterization that demonstrates the isoelectronic Ce3+ and Pr4+ ions exhibit divergent magnetic properties.







Abstract
The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8722; (tBu=tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxy&#8208;Carbonylation of Aryl and Vinyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides is reported by utilizing a (P,N)&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation operates under mild reaction conditions with low CO pressure (balloon) and exhibits excellent chemoselectivity for C(sp2)&#8722;I bond over other C(sp2)&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl, Br, OMs, and OTf).







Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides utilizing ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. The present methodology is found to be general, efficient, employs mild reaction conditions and showcases a broad substrate scope even with structurally complex molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed mechanistic pathways distinct from those of conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Polyamides via Main&#8208;Chain Modification of Polyethyleneketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi&#8208;quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.

In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three-color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non-invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;Naphthalene Bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photofunctional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>

         <dc:description>
Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase ZgGH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic&#8208;based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra&#8208;constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.







Abstract
The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation B1,4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;E4/1C4 and deglycosylation E4/1C4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;B1,4 itineraries limited to the Southern Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non&#8208;standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design for anhydro&#8208;type carbohydrate&#8208;processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, our study provides a rare example of distinct niche&#8208;based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate&#8208;active enzyme family.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular editing reaction for converting pyrrole rings into benzene rings through a sequential pathway of Diels&#8211;Alder and cheletropic reactions was developed. The nitrogen atom in a N&#8208;bridged intermediate is eliminated in the form of N2O by a strain&#8208;releasing pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of substituted benzene and naphthalene derivatives.







Abstract
Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially, N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.

         <title>Stabilization of the Compressed Planar Benzene Dianion in Inverse&#8208;Sandwich Rare Earth Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, the capture of a planar antiaromatic benzene dianion in between two trivalent rare earth (RE) metal cations, each stabilized by two guanidinate ligands, is reported. The synthesized inverse&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2RE]2(&#181;&#8211;&#414;6:&#414;6&#8211;C6H6), (RE = Y (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)) feature a remarkably planar benzene dianion, previously not encountered for any metal ion prone to low or absent covalency. The &#8208;2 charge localization at the benzene ligand was deduced from the results obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, spectroscopy, magnetometry, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the diamagnetic Y complex 1, the equivalent proton resonance of the bridging benzene dianion ligand is drastically shifted to higher field in comparison to free benzene. This and the calculated highly positive Nucleus&#8208;Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values are attributed to the antiaromatic character of the benzene dianion ligand. &#160;The crucial role of the ancillary guanidinate ligand scaffold in stabilizing the planar benzene dianion conformation was also elucidated by DFT calculations. Remarkably, the planarity of the benzene dianion originates from the stabilization of the &#960;&#8208;type orbitals of the d&#8208;manifold and compression through its strong electrostatic interaction with the two REIII sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer by a Zirconium&#8208;based Molecular Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) has important energetic implications in numerous synthetic and natural redox processes. The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H2 evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr&#8208;based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr&#8208;based molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Oxidative Catalytic Reactions Triggered by Cavitation Bubbles Confinement on Copper Oxide Microstructured Particles.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient energy transfer management in catalytic processes is crucial for overcoming activation energy barriers while minimizing costs and CO2 emissions. We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates the selective and efficient acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, avoiding the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes. Utilizing a chemical thermometric approach, we demonstrate that the local temperature on the surface of our CuO particles during cavitation bubble implosions can create an effective equivalent temperature of about 360&#176;C. This temperature effect facilitates the efficient catalysis of oxidative reactions using an organic probe molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H2O2 and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H2O2 and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Driven Modular Precision Chemistry of Graphene Using &#955;3&#8208;iodanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)&#8208;patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine&#8208;centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser&#8208;induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D&#8208;structuring of this 2D&#8208;film. The tailor&#8208;made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Shape&#8208;persistent Conjugated nanobelts are fascinating synthetic targets. However, in most cases these are made in low overall yields by applying strategies of macrocyclization followed by (multiple) ring fusion reactions for nanobelt formation. Here, we describe the high yielding synthesis of enantiopure chiral nanobelts in 84% yield by applying chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). The chiral nanobelts were investigated by UV/vis and CD spectroscopy. By DFT calculations the aromaticity of these structures is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics through Interfacial Environments Induced Surface Migration of Adsorbed Hydroxyl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing bifunctional sites through heterojunction engineering to accelerate water formation has become a pivotal strategy to improve the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, which is mainly focused on the synergistic effect of neighboring sites and the energetics of the surface reaction steps. However, the roles of the surface migration of key intermediates that go beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to neighboring atoms have usually been ignored. Using the heterostructured Ni3C&#8208;Ni catalyst as a model, we found that the rapid surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni component played a decisive role in facilitating water formation. Such unprecedented surface migration of OHad is induced by the large discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments of the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions. Benefiting from this, the resultant Ni3C&#8208;Ni exhibited outstanding mass activity for the alkaline HOR, which was approximately 19&#8208;fold and 21&#8208;fold higher than those of Ni and Ni3C, respectively. These findings not only provide novel insights into the alkaline HOR mechanism of heterostructured catalysts but also open new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of NIR&#8208;II Emission of Er3+ by Doping Fe3+ in Double Perovskites: Multimode Luminescence for Versatile Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Erbium ions are commonly used to extend the photoelectric properties of metal halide perovskites from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency multi&#8208;mode luminescence in a single system is difficult due to the weak absorption associated with forbidden 4f&#8208;4f transitions. In this study, a unique strategy is proposed to adjust multi&#8208;mode luminescence and enhance NIR&#8208;II emission in Cs2NaBiCl6 by incorporating Fe3+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared material demonstrates reversible thermochromism, driven by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling effect, and exhibits tunable luminescence that can be adjusted by altering excitation energy and temperature. Notably, benefitting from the charge transfer transition of Fe3+&#8208;Cl&#8208; along with the influence of Fe3+ doping on the geometrical and electronic structures, the blue&#8208;excitable (450 nm) NIR&#8208;II emission around 1541 nm from Er3+ is realized for the first time, achieving an intensity 16.7 times higher and a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 22.5%. This enhancement enables innovative applications such as two&#8208;dimensional information encryption by the multi&#8208;channel cooperative responses and improved NIR imaging. The study highlights the potential of Fe3+ doping in optimizing absorption and multi&#8208;mode luminescence in perovskites, opening avenues for advanced applications in blue&#8208;excitable NIR light emitting diodes, thermometer, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and NIR imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fischer&#8208;lactonization&#8208;driven mechanism for ultra&#8208;efficient recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrometallurgy remains a major challenge to simplify its complex separation and precipitation processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein,&#160;we propose a Fischer&#8208;lactonisation&#8208;driven&#160;mechanism for the cascade reaction of leaching and chelation of spent LIBs. Citric acid undergoes a two&#8208;step dissociation of the carboxylic acid (&#8208;COOH) and complexes with the leached metal ion, while the residual &#8208;COOH is attacked by H protons to form a protonated carboxyl ion (&#8208;COO^&#8208;). Subsequently, the lone pair of electrons in the hydroxyl of the same molecule attack the carbon atom in &#8208;COO^&#8208; to facilitate ester bonding, leading to the formation of a lactonized&#160;gel.&#160;The leaching rates of Li, Ni, Co and Mn are 99.3, 99.1, 99.5 and 99.2%, respectively.&#160;The regenerated&#160;monocrystalline&#160;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2&#160;(NCM523)&#160;has&#160;a uniform particle size distribution and complete lamellar structure,&#160;with a capacity retention rate of 70.6% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. The&#160;mechanism achieves a one&#8208;step chelation reaction, and the energy consumption and carbon emissions are only 26% and 44%, respectively, of that of the conventional hydrometallurgical.&#160;The strategy achieves a double breakthrough in simplifying the process and improving environmental friendliness, offering a sustainable approach to the re&#8208;utilization of spent LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient CRISPR/Cas Cooperative Shearing Platform for Clinical Diagnostics Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas&#8208;CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR&#8208;CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue&#8208;ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5 minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&#8722;20 M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays. The CRISPR&#8208;CS platform detects monkeypox, human papilloma virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with an accuracy up to 98.1%, demonstrating the potential application of the efficient cooperative shearing.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Reduction and Functionalization by a Siloxide Supported Thulium&#8208;Potassium Complex for the formation of Ammonia or Hydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dinitrogen (N2)&#160;chemistry of lanthanides remains less developed compared to the d&#8208;block metals and lanthanide&#8208;promoted N2&#160;functionalization chemistry in well&#8208;defined lanthanide complexes remains elusive. Here we report the synthesis and characterization (SQUID, EPR, DFT, X&#8208;Ray) of the siloxide supported heterobimetallic (Tm/K) complexes&#160;[{KTm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1)&#160;and&#160;[K3{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (2). Complex&#160;2&#160;provides a rare example of a metal complex of the triply reduced&#160;N23&#8208;&#160;radical. The structure of&#160;2&#160;differs from the few previously reported N23&#8208;&#160;complexes as it presents two Tm and three K cations binding the N23&#8208;&#160;radical, facilitating N2&#160;functionalization. Notably, the K3Tm2&#8208;bound N23&#8208;&#160;moiety reacts with excess H+&#160;to form NH4Cl in 18% yield, and with MeOTf at room temperature to yield the dimethyl hydrazido complex&#160;[K2{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;(CH3)NN(CH3))] (3). Protonolysis of&#160;3yields MeHN&#8208;NMeH&#183;2HCl in 18 % yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Stabilization of a Non&#8208;heme Iron Enzyme Enables Efficient Evolution of New Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep learning tools for enzyme design are rapidly emerging, and there is a critical need to evaluate their effectiveness in engineering workflows. Here we show that the deep learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially&#8208;relevant non&#8208;native functions. This superfamily has diverse catalytic functions and could provide a rich new source of biocatalysts for synthesis and industrial processes. Through systematic comparisons of directed evolution trajectories for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8208;H hydroxylation reaction, we demonstrate that the stabilized redesign can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme. After three rounds of directed evolution, we obtained a 6&#8208;fold activity increase from the wild&#8208;type parent and an 80&#8208;fold increase from the stabilized variant. To generate the initial stabilized variant, we identified multiple structural and sequence constraints to preserve catalytic function. We applied these criteria to produce stabilized, catalytically active variants of a second Fe(II)/&#945;KG enzyme, suggesting that the approach is generalizable to additional members of the Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily. ProteinMPNN is user&#8208;friendly and widely&#8208;accessible, and our results provide a framework for the routine implementation of deep learning&#8208;based protein stabilization tools in directed evolution workflows for novel biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Tandem Photocatalytic Methanation of CO2 by Lacunary Polyoxometalates&#8208;Stabilized *CO Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g&#8208;C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x = 12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80% and 40.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 evolution rate for PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. Conversely, g&#8208;C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process.  CO2 is initially activated on g&#8208;C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g&#8208;C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO.  However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g&#8208;C3N4 (x = 12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Prelithiation and Interface Protection to Achieve High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), particularly those with Li&#8208;free anodes or even anode&#8208;free configurations, have attracted extensive attention due to high safety and energy density. However, chemical&#8208;mechanical degradation typically deteriorates the cycle life and energy of Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs with the absence of Li inventory. Here, the prelithiation agent Li5FeO4 (LFO) coated Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide is developed as the cathode for Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs. The coated LFO acts as an interfacial protective layer to prevent the highly oxidizing Ni&#8208;rich cathode from reacting with sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the structural degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and the decomposition of SSE, resulting in excellent cycle life. Beneficial from the coated LFO in the cathode of the Li&#8208;free anode ASSBs, the reversible capacity improves from 174.7 mAh g&#8722;1 to 199.7 mAh g&#8722;1, and the capacity retention is enhanced from 33.8% to 84.8% after 100 cycles. Additionally, an ultrahigh energy density of 440 Wh kg&#8722;1, based on the mass of the composite cathode, Li&#8208;free anode, and SSE, is obtained in a Li&#8208;free anode all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell equipped with the LFO&#8208;coated cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Role  of Oxophilic Cr4+ in Cr&#8208;Cu2O Nanosheet Arrays for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuprous oxide (Cu2O)&#8208;based catalysts present a promising activity for the electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8208;) reduction to ammonia (eNO3RA), but the electrochemical instability of Cu+ species may lead to an unsatisfactory durability, hindering the exploration of the structure&#8208;performance relationship. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to stabilize Cu+ through the incorporation of Cr4+ into the Cu2O matrix to construct a Cr4+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ network structure. In situ and quasi&#8208;in situ characterizations reveal that the Cu+ species are well maintained via the strong Cr4+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ interaction that inhibits the leaching of lattice oxygen. Importantly, in situ generated Cr3+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ from Cr4+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ is identified as a dual&#8208;active site for eNO3RA, wherein the Cu+ sites are responsible for the activation of N&#8208;containing intermediates, while the assisting Cr3+ centers serve as the electron&#8208;proton mediators for rapid water dissociation. Theoretical investigations further demonstrated that the metastable state Cr3+&#8208;O&#8208;Cu+ favors the conversion from the endoergic hydrogenation of the key *ON intermediate to an exoergic reaction in an ONH pathway, and facilitates the subsequent NH3 desorption with a low energy barrier. The superior eNO3RA with a maximum 91.6% Faradaic efficiency could also be coupled with anodic sulfion oxidation to achieve concurrent NH3 production and sulfur recovery with reduced energy input.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal Chelation Therapy to Effectively Eliminate Breast Cancer and Intratumor Bacteria While Suppressing Tumor Metastasis by Copper Depletion and Zinc Ions Surge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intratumor microbiota results in the immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. However, developing a synergistic therapy with antitumor, antibacterial, and antimetastatic effects faces enormous challenges. Here, we propose an&#160;metal chelation therapy to effectively eliminate tumor and intratumor bacteria and suppress tumor metastasis. Different from traditional chelation therapy that only consumes metal elements, this therapy not only eliminates the crucial metal elements for tumor metabolism but also releases new metal ions with antitumor and antibacterial properties. Based on the high demand for copper in breast cancer, we prepare a fibrous therapeutic nanoagent (Zn&#8208;PEN) by chelating&#160;D&#8208;Penicillamine (D&#8208;PEN) with Zn2+. Firstly, Zn&#8208;PEN achieves dual inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation&#160;and glycolysis metabolism &#160;through copper depletion and Zn2+ activated cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, thus inducing tumor cell death. Secondly, Zn&#8208;PEN has the capability to eradicate Fusobacterium nucleatum&#160;in breast cancer, thereby mitigating its immunosuppressive impact on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, Zn&#8208;PEN effectively inhibits tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the inhibition of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum. Therefore, we verify the feasibility of Zn&#8208;PEN mediated metal chelation therapy in a 4T1 model infected with F. nucleatum, providing a new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor metastasis.</dc:description>

However, developing a synergistic therapy with antitumor, antibacterial, and antimetastatic effects faces enormous challenges. Here, we propose an&#160;metal chelation therapy to effectively eliminate tumor and intratumor bacteria and suppress tumor metastasis. Different from traditional chelation therapy that only consumes metal elements, this therapy not only eliminates the crucial metal elements for tumor metabolism but also releases new metal ions with antitumor and antibacterial properties. Based on the high demand for copper in breast cancer, we prepare a fibrous therapeutic nanoagent (Zn-PEN) by chelating&#160;D-Penicillamine (D-PEN) with Zn2+. Firstly, Zn-PEN achieves dual inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation&#160;and glycolysis metabolism &#160;through copper depletion and Zn2+ activated cGAS-STING pathway, thus inducing tumor cell death. Secondly, Zn-PEN has the capability to eradicate Fusobacterium nucleatum&#160;in breast cancer, thereby mitigating its immunosuppressive impact on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, Zn-PEN effectively inhibits tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, activation of cGAS-STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum. Therefore, we verify the feasibility of Zn-PEN mediated metal chelation therapy in a 4T1 model infected with F. nucleatum, providing a new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Enantioselective synthesis of (spiro)cyclobutane derivatives poses significant challenges yet holds promising applications for both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. We report here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of alkynones to synthesize alkenyl cyclobutanols with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, delivering a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing rigid (spiro)carbocycle&#160;skeletons in good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 84% yield and 98.5:1.5 er). The synthetic utility is demonstrated through stereospecific transformations into fused spirocycles. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is initiated by an active Ni&#8211;H species, with carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation as the key for regioselective control.&#160;This catalytic method provides a general solution for regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes&#160;and&#160;represents an efficient reaction pattern for assembling highly strained enantioenriched bioisosteres.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Mg2IrH6 Is Predicted to Be a High&#8208;Temperature Superconductor, But Ca2IrH6 Is Not</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The X2MH6 family, consisting of an electropositive cation X and a main group metal M octahedrally coordinated by hydrogen, has been predicted to hold promise for high&#8208;temperature conventional superconductivity. Herein, we analyze the electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg2IrH6 and Ca2IrH6, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties rivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within Mg2IrH6 the vibrations of the IrH64&#8208;&#160;anions are key for the superconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the eg* set, which are antibonding between the H 1s and the Ir dx2&#8722;y2 or dz2 orbitals. Because calcium possesses low&#8208;lying d&#8208;orbitals, eg* &#8594; Ca d&#160;back&#8208;donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our analysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second or third row X metal atoms and&#160;may hold implications for superconductivity in other systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.</dc:description>

         <title>Marine Amoebae&#8208;Inspired Salting Hydrogels to Reconfigure Anisotropy for Reprogrammable Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reprogrammable shape morphing is ubiquitous in living beings and highly crucial for them to move in normal situations, even to survive under dangerous conditions. There is increasing interest in using asymmetric hydrogel structures to understand and mimic living beings&#8217; shape morphing upon an external trigger in a controlled way. However, these asymmetric or heterogeneous configurations cannot be further modified once the polymer hydrogels are prepared. Therefore, it is a great challenge to achieve reprogrammable shape morphing using the existing hydrogels. Inspired by marine amoebae, which transform into several different morphologies according to the various external salt concentrations, a new strategy is developed for salting hydrogels to reconfigure their anisotropy toward reprogrammable shape morphing. Polyampholyte hydrogels with equal stoichiometric COO&#8210; and N+(CH3)3 groups were first swollen in HCl/NaCl solution. After being then transferred into water, they first swollen again by water uptake driven by the osmotic pressure, and then were spontaneously deswollen due to increase in internal pH and dialysis of ions leading to deprotonation of COOH to COO&#8210; and regeneration of COO&#8210;/N+(CH3)3 electrostatic attraction. This work provides a novel strategy to reconfigure anisotropy of hydrogel soft actuators and to open up an avenue for reprogrammable shape morphing.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;tough Dynamic Supramolecular Ion&#8208;conducting Elastomer Induced Uniform Li+ Transport and Stabilizes Interphase Ensures Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial polymer solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) with microphase&#8208;separated structures provide promising solutions to the inhomogeneity and cracking issues of natural SEIs in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, achieving homogeneous ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and superior interfacial stability remains challenging due to interference from hard&#8208;phase domains in ion transport and solid&#8208;solid interface issues with lithium metal. Herein, we present a dynamic supramolecular ion&#8208;conducting poly(urethane&#8208;urea) interphase (DSIPI) that achieves these three properties through modulating the hard&#8208;phase domains and constructing a composite SEI in situ. The soft&#8208;phase polytetrahydrofuran backbone, featuring loose Li+&#8208;O coordinating interactions, ensures uniform Li+ transport. Concurrently, sextuple hydrogen bonds in the hard phase dissipate strain energy through sequential bond cleavage, thereby imparting exceptional mechanical properties. Moreover, enriched bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8208;) in DSIPI promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of a stable polymer&#8208;inorganic composite SEI during cycling. Consequently, the DSIPI&#8208;protected lithium anode (DSIPI@Li) enables symmetric cells with exceptional cyclability exceeding 4,000 hours at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20 mA cm&#8208;2, thereby demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, DSIPI@Li facilitates stable operation of the pouch cells under the constraints of a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio. This work presents a powerful strategy for designing artificial SEIs and high&#8208;performance LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Polarity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO2 by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO2. However, the potential of MOFs grafted to polar functional group to activate CO2 has not been investigated in the context of CO2 electrolysis. In this study, we report a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to incorporate various functional groups in the MOFs. We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased catalytic performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that the presence of polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution in the micropores of MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands reduces the energy barrier to generate *COOH, which is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO2. Our research offers an effective method of disrupting local electron neutrality in the pores of electrocatalysts/supports to activate CO2 under electrochemical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Mediated f&#8208;p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling: Achieving Selective Seawater Oxidation and Breaking *OH and *OOH Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of materials for hydrogen production via seawater electrolysis at high current densities plays a crucial role in producing renewable hydrogen energy. However, during the seawater electrolysis process, the anode inevitably undergoes chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) due to Cl&#8208; adsorption, making the seawater electrolysis process difficult to sustain. Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we propose a biomimetic design of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) layers. Combining experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been demonstrated that cerium dioxide layers with FLPs sites can decompose water molecules, capture hydroxyl anions, and repel chloride ions simultaneously. DFT theoretical analysis indicates that the FLP sites regulate the Ce 4f&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Ni 3d gradient orbital coupling, providing additional oxygen non&#8208;bonding (ONB) to stabilize the Ni&#8208;O bond and optimize the adsorption strength of intermediates, thereby breaking the *OH and *OOH scaling relationship. Assembled anion exchange membrane electrolyzers exhibit an efficiency of 95.7% at a current density of 0.1 A cm&#8208;2 and can stably operate for 250 hours at a current density of 0.2 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

Assembled anion exchange membrane electrolyzers exhibit an efficiency of 95.7% at a current density of 0.1 A cm-2 and can stably operate for 250 hours at a current density of 0.2 A cm-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Knowledge&#8211;Data Dual&#8208;Driven Framework for Predicting the Molecular Properties of Rechargeable Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing rechargeable batteries that operate within a wide temperature range and possess high safety has become necessary with increasing demands. Rapid and accurate assessment of the melting points (MPs), boiling points (BPs), and flash points (FPs) of electrolyte molecules is essential for expediting battery development. Herein, we introduce Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI), a knowledge&#8211;data dual&#8208;driven framework for molecular property prediction of electrolytes. Initially, the KPI collects molecular structures and properties, and then automatically organizes them into structured datasets. Subsequently, interpretable machine learning further explores the structure&#8211;property relationships of molecules from a microscopic perspective. Finally, by embedding the discovered knowledge into property prediction models, the KPI achieved very low mean absolute errors of 10.4, 4.6, and 4.8 K for MP, BP, and FP predictions, respectively. The KPI reached state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art results in 18 out of 20 datasets. Utilizing molecular neighbor search and high&#8208;throughput screening, 15 and 14 promising molecules, with and without Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number, respectively, were predicted for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range and high&#8208;safety batteries. The KPI not only accurately predicts molecular properties and deepens the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships but also serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and &#160;domain knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Multiple Active Sites for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well&#8208;regulated &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reactivity with Sulfondiimidoyl Fluorides for the Synthesis of Heteroaryl Sulfondiimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur functional groups are ubiquitous in molecules used in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and within these collections sulfones hold a prominent position. The double aza&#8208;analogues of sulfones, sulfondiimines, offer significant potential in discovery chemistry but to date their applications have been limited by the lack of convenient synthetic routes. The existing methods mainly rely on imination of low&#8208;valent&#8208;sulfur intermediates, or the combination of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents and electrophilic S(VI)&#8208;functionalities. Herein, we describe a Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides with (hetero)aryls. This new SuFEx reactivity benefits from broad functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and does not require the use of pre&#8208;formed organometallic reagents. The efficient use of unprotected indoles and pyrroles, as well as furan, thiophene and carbocyclic aromatics, further demonstrates the advantages of these reactions. We show that the reactivity of the sulfondiimidoyl fluorides can be tuned by switching the N&#8208;substituents, allowing an expansion of the range of coupling partners. The utility of the transformation is exemplified by the synthesis of the sulfondiimine analogue of the HIV&#8208;I reverse transcriptase&#8208;inhibitor L&#8208;737,126.</dc:description>

However, their application is limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and negatively shift the redox potentials of quinone material. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7 meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex&#8208;situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500 cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Oxidized Tr&#246;ger's Base Macrocyclic Arenes: Unprecedented Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high enantioselectivity with synthetic receptors, particularly in water, remains a significant challenge despite the success seen in natural biological systems. In this study, we introduce a facile synthesis of Tr&#246;ger's base (TB)&#8208;containing macrocyclic arenes (TBn), where TB units are linked via methylene bridges, providing the macrocycles with a rigid framework. Oxidation of enantiopure TBn yields corresponding chiral nitrogen oxides (TBnNO) with excellent water solubility, attributed to the high polarity of the N&#8208;O bond, surpassing the pH limitations of traditional ion&#8208;functionalized approaches. Remarkably, TBnNO exhibits exceptional enantioselective recognition toward a wide range of chiral guests in aqueous solution, achieving enantioselectivities as high as 41.0. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of hydrophobic interactions and steric effects caused by rigid chiral cavities. These findings highlight the potential of nitrogen&#8208;oxidized macrocycles as a transformative tool for supramolecular application in water.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cluster&#8208;based spin crossover (SCO) frameworks are a new class of smart metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse structures and topologies and unique bistable physicochemical properties. Here, we report a cluster&#8208;based SCO framework [Fe3{Ag4(CN)6(H2O)}2(TPBA)3](ClO4)2&#183;7DMF (1) with an extremely rare 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology, in which the tripodal [Ag{Ag(CN)2}3(H2O)]2&#8722; clusters axially link the Fe2+ ions to form 2D&#8594;3D n&#8208;fold Borromean entangled networks. Under the guidance of reticular chemistry, the post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) from 1 with 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology to [Fe3{Ag8X8(CN)6}(TPBA)3] (2_X, X = Cl, Br, I) with urk topology is firstly achieved via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Moreover, the successive SCSC transformations from 2_Cl to 2_Br and then to 2_I are realized for the first time. Their SCO behaviors are also modified by halogen&#8208;driven stepwise cluster transformations. Hence, these findings provide new strategies for the development of cluster&#8208;based SCO MOFs towards the smart functional porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unleashed Remarkable Energy Storage Performance in Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based Relaxor Ferroelectrics by Local Structural Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric capacitors harvest energy through an electrostatic&#160;process, which enables an ultrafast charging&#8208;discharging rate and ultrahigh power density. However, achieving high energy density (Wrec) and efficiency (&#951;) simultaneously, especially when preserving them across a wide frequency/temperature range or cycling numbers, remains challenging. In this work, by especially introducing NaTaO3 into the representative ferroelectric relaxor of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 and leveraging the mismatch between B&#8208;site atoms, we proposed a method of enhancing local structural fluctuation to refine the polar configuration and to effectively improve its overall energy&#8208;storage performances. As a consequence, the ceramic exhibits an ultrahigh Wrec of 15.0 J/cm3 and high &#951; up to 80%, along with a very wide frequency stability of 10 &#8211; 200 Hz and extensive cycling number up to 108. In&#8208;depth local structure and chemical environment investigations, consisting of atom&#8208;scale electron microscopy, neutron total scattering, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, reveal that the randomly distributed A/B&#8208;site atom pairs emerge in the system, leading to the evident local structural fluctuations and concomitant polymorphic polar nanodomains. These key ingredients contribute to the large polarization, minimal hysteresis, and high breakdown strength, thereby promoting energy&#8208;storage performances. This work opens a new path for designing high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors via manipulating local structural fluctuations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromative Dephosphinidenation of a Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene toward E&#8722;H (E=H, Si, N and P) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a bulky amino substituent at phosphorous enables the development of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene. This compound serves as an efficient phosphinidene synthon, thermally releasing transient phosphinidenes shown to activate dihydrogen (H2), E&#8722;H (E=Si, N and P) bonds and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (5) was prepared by treatment of a sterically encumbered amino phosphorus dichloride (3) with MgA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 (A=anthracene). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a pentacyclic framework consisting of 5 with two phosphirane rings fused to the anthracene in a trans&#8208;fashion. Compound 5 has been shown to be an efficient phosphinidene synthon, readily liberating two transient phosphinidene units for subsequent downstream bond activation via the reductive elimination of anthracene under mild conditions. The formal oxidative addition of H2 and E&#8722;H (E=Si, N, P) bonds by the liberated phosphinidene provided diphosphine and substituted phosphines. Furthermore, phosphinidene transfer to alkenes and alkynes smoothly yielded the corresponding phosphiranes and phosphirenes. The mechanism of the H2 activation by 5 was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Delocalized Orbitals over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi-electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalytic performance with high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production yield and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol&#160;Related to its Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that&#160;of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters:&#160; collective rearrangements are&#160;3 times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can&#160;boost&#160;reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to CH3OH emerges as a promising strategy to sustainably utilize natural gas and mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, there remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of methanol by using O2 at low temperature. Inspired by the catalytic structure in soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) and the corresponding reaction mechanism, we prepared a biomimetic photocatalysts with the decoration of Fe2O3 nanocluster and satellite Fe single atom immobilized on carbon nitride. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity of 5.02 mmol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with methanol selectivity of 98.5%. Mechanism studies reveal that the synergy between Fe2O3 nanocluster and Fe single atom establishes a dual&#8208;Fe site as MMO for O2 activation and subsequent CH4 partial oxidation. Moreover, the light excitation of Fe2O3&#160;nanoclusters with a relative narrow bandgap could deliver the electrons and protons to atomic Fe that facilitating the oxygen reduction kinetics for the robust of methanol synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhomogeneous Coordination in High&#8208;entropy O3&#8208;type Cathodes Enables Suppressed Slab Gliding and Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>O3&#8208;type layered oxides are highly promising cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), however they undergo complex phase transitions and exhibit high sensibility to air, leading to subpar cycling performance and commercial viability. In this work, we report a layered cathode material (NaNi0.29Cu0.1Mg0.05Li0.05Mn0.2Ti0.2Sn0.11O2) with a sate&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;entropy compositional design. We unveil that such a configuration featuring inhomogeneous coordination environment of transition metal (TM) elements, can enable enhanced gliding energy (&#8208;0.38 vs &#8208;0.58 eV) of TMO2 slabs upon desodiation both theoretically and experimentally, which underlies the fundamental origin of the outstanding structural stability of HEO materials. As a consequence, the complex phase transitions (O3&#8208;O'3&#8208;P3&#8208;P'3&#8208;P3'&#8208;O3') of conventional O3&#8208;type cathode have been eliminated, and the as&#8208;obtained material demonstrates exceptional structural robustness and integrity with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life in a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cell (maintaining 73.2% capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C). Moreover, the material presents satisfactory air stability, with minimal structural and electrochemical degradation when directly exposed to the air. An Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell based on the cathode material is constructed, demonstrating a capacity retention of 83.6% after 500 cycles, signaling substantial promise for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Strontium Doped IrOx Triggers Direct O&#8208;O Coupling to Boost Acid Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2&#8208;assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium&#8208;doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir&#8208;O covalency. This design facilitates direct O&#8208;O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr&#8208;IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr&#8208;IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72 V at 1 A cm&#8208;2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500 hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr-IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72 V at 1 A cm-2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500 hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium-based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;assembly Based on a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymer towards Amplified Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials have been attaching wide attention in the field of optical information storage and encryption, while still facing the challenge of the realization of high&#160;luminescence dissymmetry&#160;factors (glum). This work presents a pair of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral co&#8208;assemblies P7R3 and P7S3 by combining polymer PFIQ containing iso&#8208;quinoline units with chiral inducers. The obtained chiral co&#8208;assemblies can reversibly undergo significant modification in CPL behavior under trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) fumigation and annealing treatment, with the |glum| values exhibiting a reversible shift between 0.2 and 0.3. Moreover, the chiral co&#8208;assemblies before TFA fumigating can effectively induce achiral emitters to generate intense full&#8208;color CPL signals through CPL energy transfer (CPL&#8208;ET), with the corresponding |glum| values larger than 0.2. Moreover, information encryption and decryption as well as a multi&#8208;level logic gates application are achieved by leveraging the reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL activity of the chiral co&#8208;assembly. This work provides a new perspective for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral luminescent materials with large |glum| values and the activation of CPL behavior in achiral emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Fluorescence Polyelectrolyte Nanoassemblies: Manipulate and Boost Singlet Oxygen in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved therapeutic modality that has shown great potential for cancer treatment. However, there exist two major problems hindering PDT applications: the nonspecific phototoxicity requiring patients to stay in dark post&#8208;PDT, and the limited photodynamic efficiency. Herein, we report a photo&#8208;triggered porphyrin polyelectrolyte nanoassembling (photo&#8208;triggered PPN) strategy, in which porphyrin photosensitizer and photoswitchable energy accepter are assembled into polyelectrolyte micelles by a combined force of charge interaction and metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The polyelectrolyte&#8208;based PPN exhibits good biocompatibility, and bestows a unique "confining isolated" inner microenvironment for fully overcoming the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of porphyrins with significant photodynamic efficiency (123&#8208;fold enhancement). Due to the high F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (91.5%) between porphyrin and photoswitch in closed&#8208;form, we could use light as a specific trigger to modulate photoswitch between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;form, and manipulate the 1O2 generation in three stages: pre&#8208;PDT (quenching 1O2 generation), during PDT (activating 1O2 generation), and post&#8208;PDT (silencing 1O2 generation). This de novo strategy has for the first time realized remotely manipulating and boosting 1O2 generation in PDT, well resolving the critical and general challenges of limited photodynamic efficiency and side effects from nonspecific phototoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Dipoles Tailoring Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Chemistry to Enable Reversible Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a decisive role in building reliable Li metal batteries. However, the scarcity of anions in Helmholtz layer (HL) caused by electrostatic repulsion usually leads to the inferior SEI derived from solvents, resulting in dendrites and &#8216;dead&#8217; Li. Therefore, regulating the distribution of anions in electric double layer (EDL) and continuously introducing more anions into HL to tailor anions&#8208;derived SEI is crucial for achieving stable Li plating/stripping. Herein, by jointly utilizing the controlled defects of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the oriented dipoles of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), the rGO&#8208;BTO composite layer sustainedly brings more TFSI&#8208; and NO3&#8208; into anion&#8208;defecient HL, promoting favorable decomposition of anions and guiding the generation of robust and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;transport SEI containing more inorganics LiF and Li3N species. Thus, the resulting Li deposit shows smooth and dense morphologies without dendrites, leading to high average Coulombic efficiency. The Li//Cu@rGO&#8208;BTO (10 mAh cm&#8208;2 plated Li) cell exhibits an enhanced Li plating/stripping stability (2700 h) and a higher rate capability. The LiFePO4 full cell (N/P=~6.3) using rGO&#8208;BTO displays an enhanced capacity retention (82.0% @ 430 cycles). This work provides a new insight on the construction of robust SEI by regulating the distribution of anions within EDL.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy&#8208;dense Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low&#8208;cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low&#8208;voltage anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&gt; 3 mAh cm&#8208;2) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4 V (vs. K+/K) high&#8208;voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full&#8208;cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61 V with a specific energy of 316.5 Wh kg&#8208;1&#8208;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of High&#8208;Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH&#8722;/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co2+ sites, the as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving Structures of Paramagnetic Systems in Chemistry and Materials Science by Solid&#8208;State NMR: the Revolving Power of Ultra&#8208;Fast MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100+ kHz) has revolutionized solid&#8208;state NMR of biomolecular systems but has so far failed to gain ground for the analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic powders, despite the potential rewards from substantially improved spectral resolution. The principal blockages are that the smaller fast&#8208;spinning rotors present significant barriers for sample preparation, particularly for air/moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, and are associated with lower sensitivity from the reduced sample volumes. Here these difficulties are overcome by improvements in rotor ceramics and handling methods that enable the routine use of this setup for repetitive, high&#8208;throughput analysis of sensitive samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sensitivity penalty is less severe than expected for highly paramagnetic solids and is more than offset by the associated improved resolution. While previous approaches employing slower MAS are often unsuccessful in providing sufficient resolution, we show that ultra&#8208;fast 100+ kHz MAS allows site&#8208;specific assignments of all resonances from complex paramagnetic solids. This opens the way to routine characterisation of geometry and electronic structures of functional paramagnetic systems in chemistry, including catalysts and battery materials. We benchmark this approach on a hygroscopic luminescent Tb3+ complex, an air&#8208;sensitive homogeneous high&#8208;spin Fe2+ catalyst, and a series of mixed Fe2+/Mn2+/Mg2+ olivine&#8208;type cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Catalysis on Carbon Nanotubes in Electromicrofluidic Reactors: Monoterpene Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control over the movement of electrons during chemical reactions with oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) has been predicted to offer a general approach to catalysis. Recently, we suggested that many problems to realize electric&#8208;field catalysis in practice under scalable bulk conditions could possibly be solved on multiwalled carbon nanotubes in electromicrofluidic reactors. Here, we selected monoterpene cyclizations to assess the scope of our system in organic synthesis. We report that electric&#8208;field catalysis can function by stabilizing both anionic and cationic transition states, depending on the orientation of the applied field. Moreover, electric&#8208;field catalysis can promote reactions which are barely accessible by general Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids and field&#8208;free anion&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, and drive chemoselectivity toward intrinsically disfavored products without the need for pyrene interfacers attached to the substrate to prolong binding to the carbon nanotubes. Finally, interfacing with chiral organocatalysts is explored and evidence against contributions from redox chemistry is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.







Abstract
Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5&#8201;%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high&#8208;performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam from 4.0&#8197;g of lignin raw material.

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Phase Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;Situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem solid&#8208;solution phase post&#8208;synthetic modifications were realized based on porous molecular crystals. The sequential reactions involve addition reaction with hydrazine hydrate and condensation reaction with alkyl aldehydes, resulting in the production of three molecular frameworks in a quantitative manner, accompanied by solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow).







Abstract
Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution phase reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.

         <title>Regulating Atomically&#8208;Precise Pt Sites for Boosting Light&#8208;Driven Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic structure of Pt single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitates robust electronic interactions with the substrate, providing an optimal spatial and electronic framework for activating and converting CO2&#8722;CH4 molecules. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, highlighting the critical role of atomically&#8208;precise interface adjustment in multi&#8208;molecule systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane is a promising and mild route to convert two greenhouse gas into valuable syngas. However, developing facile strategy to atomically&#8208;precise regulate the active sites and realize balanced and stable syngas production is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spatial confinement approach to precisely control over platinum species on TiO2 surfaces, from single atoms to nanoclusters. The configuration comprising single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters engenders pronounced electronic metal&#8208;support interactions, with resultant interfacial states prompting surface charge rearrangement. The unique geometric and electronic properties of these atom&#8208;cluster assemblies facilitate effective activation of CH4 and CO2, accelerating intermediate coupling and minimizing side reactions. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, displaying high apparent quantum yield of 9.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and turnover frequency of 1289&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work provides insightful understanding for exploring more multi&#8208;molecule systems at an atomic scale.

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of redox&#8208;active bipyridinium ligands into spin crossover active metal organic frameworks leads to void spaces reminiscent of the &#8216;little blue box&#8217;. The inclusion of a &#960;&#8208;electron rich aromatic guest molecule causes a single crystal to single crystal transformation and guest&#8208;induced spin transition. Therefore, this work inspires the spin state control of these systems through the application of (photo&#8208;)electrical stimuli.







Abstract
Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.

         <title>Reversible Local Protonation&#8208;Deprotonation: Tuning Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Zinc Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnX4 and monoprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnX4 (X=Cl, Br) were constructed from a single chiral organic cation. The reversible structural transformation induced by polar solvents and HBr/heat engenders chiroptical switching behaviors. The structural design strategy developed in this work elucidates the structure&#8208;property mechanism underlying the structural transitions and the distortion&#8208;related chirality transfer.







Abstract
Precise control over the organic composition is crucial for tailoring the distinctive structures and properties of hybrid metal halides. However, this approach is seldom utilized to develop materials that exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of enantiomeric hybrid zinc bromides: biprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H16N2)ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnBr4) and monoprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H15N2)2ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnBr4), derived from the chiral organic amine (R/S)&#8208;2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine ((R/S)&#8208;C12H14N2). These compounds showcase luminescent properties; the zero&#8208;dimensional biprotonated form emits green light at 505&#8197;nm, while the monoprotonated form, with a pseudo&#8208;layered structure, displays red luminescence at 599 and 649&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the reversible local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior of the organic cations allows for exposure to polar solvents and heating to induce reversible structural and luminescent transformations between the two forms. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower energy barrier associated with the deprotonation process within the pyrrole ring is responsible for the local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior observed. These enantiomorphic hybrid zinc bromides also exhibit switchable circular dichroism (CD) and CPL properties. Furthermore, their chloride counterparts were successfully obtained by adjusting the halogen ions. Importantly, the unique stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL characteristics position these hybrid zinc halides as promising candidates for applications in information storage, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom efficient method of producing diborane from borohydride sources has been provided. Ionic liquids provide a controlled source of boron trifluoride which acts as a Lewis acid to release diborane. The EMIM generated from the ionic liquid also burns effectively in air making a highly efficient fuel source which combusts in air.







Abstract
Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3D printed propellant formulation was also tested.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2 Catalysts in Li&#8722;S Batteries by Anion&#8208;Cation Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion P and cation Mo co&#8208;doped MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) electrocatalyst was designed for durable Li&#8722;S batteries. Such P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 electrocatalyst combine strong anchoring for polysulfides with the uniquely selective bi&#8208;directional electrocatalytic activity for nucleation and dissociation of Li2S, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and achieving simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li2S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce the cyclability of Li&#8722;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion&#8208;cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li2S.

     alt="Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2 Catalysts in Li&#8722;S Batteries by Anion-Cation Doping"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anion P and cation Mo co-doped MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (P,Mo-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrocatalyst was designed for durable Li&#8722;S batteries. Such P,Mo-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst combine strong anchoring for polysulfides with the uniquely selective bi-directional electrocatalytic activity for nucleation and dissociation of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and achieving simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high-efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce the cyclability of Li&#8722;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion-cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (P,Mo-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the pivotal role of dopants in fine-tuning the d-band center and optimizing the electronic structure of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, this well-designed configuration processes catalytic selectivity. Specifically, P-doping expedites rapid Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nucleation kinetics by minimizing reaction-free energy, while Mo-doping facilitates robust Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S dissolution kinetics by mitigating decomposition barriers. This dual-doping approach equips P,Mo-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with robust bi-directional catalytic activity, effectively overcoming passivation effect and suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. Consequently, Li&#8722;S batteries incorporating P,Mo-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based separators demonstrate favorable performance than pristine TMOs. This design offers rational viewpoint for the development of catalytic materials with superior bi-directional sulfur electrocatalytic in Li&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical Isomerization Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Access C5, C6 or C7 Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical isomerization homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been successfully developed. Utilizing various monomers, the radical translocation pathway involving cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer occurs with remarkable efficiency and selectivity. These distinct propagation mechanisms enable C5, C6, or C7 polymerizations with precise control over monomer composition and main chain sequence.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated linear &#945;&#8208;olefins are valuable building blocks for organic transformation or olefin (co)polymerization, but they are recognized as textbook knowledge for non&#8208;homopolymerizable monomers under radical conditions. In this article, we disclose our effort to achieve an unprecedented library of all carbon&#8208;bonded sequence&#8208;regulated polymers via radical isomerization homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefin derivatives. The success of this distinctive polymerization is attributed to the remarkable efficiency and selectivity exhibited during the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer, which is greatly enhanced by the precise engineering of their monomer structures. This polymerization process enables the elongation of polymer chains by five, six, or seven carbon atoms at each propagation step. These polymers, obtained through the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer involved radical isomerization polymerization processes, emerge as promising candidates resembling polyethylene or polyacrylonitrile copolymers.

         <title>Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework possesses synergistic C2H2 binding sites on its pore surface, firstly realizing one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2 mixture.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C2H6 and C2H2. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture because of the low C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C2H6 and C2H2 preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF&#8208;TDCPB can not only obtain high&#8208;purity C2H4 from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture, with the C2H4 productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF&#8208;TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high&#8208;humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C2H2, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.

This paper designs a substrate&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional conducting metal&#8211;organic framework with high density of active sites (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)) as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in neutral and alkaline electrolytes.

Moreover, thermodynamics and kinetics are combined to explain the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental conclusions, which provides a referable direction for further computationally guided experiments.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of CoN4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90&#8201;%/85&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8211;0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications. This strategy thus provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites, promoting high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2 and beyond.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative B&#8592;N bonds simultaneously integrate solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect and visible light reactivity into a crystalline supramolecular host. Alkenes organized by B&#8592;N bonds enable rapid guest release within the host upon visible light exposure in air through [2+2] photocycloaddition. Benefiting from the reversible structural transformation between B&#8592;N host and adduct cocrystal, a customized capture and release of guests is realized.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447&#8197;nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Cu&#8208;Doped NiCo Alloy Supported on Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu doped NiCo alloy supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) is synthesized. Because Cu doping facilitates the coupling of reaction intermediates with surface adsorbed oxygen, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and formate Faraday efficiency. Besides, a coupled system of glycerol oxidation with nitrate reduction is constructed, which further enhances the activity, reduces energy consumption and gains valuable ammonia simultaneously.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol which is regarded as a main byproduct of industrial biodiesel production, is an innovative strategy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals, but currently showcases slow kinetics, limited Faraday efficiency, and unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency electrooxidation of glycerol into formate via a Cu doped NiCo alloy catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) in a coupled system paired with nitrate reduction. The designed Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF delivers only 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record Faraday efficiency of formate of 93.8&#8201;%. The superior performance is ascribed to the rapid generation of NiIII&#8722;OOH and CoIII&#8722;OOH species and favorable coupling of surface *O with reactive intermediates. Using Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF as a bifunctional catalyst, the coupled system synchronously produces NH3 and formate, showing 290&#8197;mV lower than the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction, together with excellent long&#8208;term stability for up to 144&#8197;h. This work lays out new guidelines and reliable strategies from catalyst design to system coupling for biomass&#8208;derived electrochemical refinery.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral homopropargylic alcohols affords cyclopentenes with a quaternary chiral center. A chiral binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl phosphine ligand featuring a distal phosphoryl group enables gold&#8208;ligand cooperation in this highly enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cyclization chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety&#8212;an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the substrate HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of enoate and ketone precursors. In addition to monocyclic cyclopentenes, spirocyclic and bicyclic ones are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient method for the C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines was developed using readily available sulfinates and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This photoinduced radical approach enables the difunctionalization of alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane, providing access to a wide variety of fluoroalkylated pyridines.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, challenges are often faced with conventional Minisci reactions in achieving precise regioselectivity owing to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis of zinc cyclopropoxide enables a stereoselective hydroxyallylation of cyclopropenes with enolized homoenolate as a transient prochiral nucleophile, thus affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. An enantioselective variant has also been achieved using a chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC.

A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Focus Workflow for Simultaneously Engineering High Activity and Thermal Stability in Methyl Parathion Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;focus computationally guided iterative mutagenesis workflow was developed to simultaneously improve stability and activity in methyl parathion hydrolase. Thus, this study details a strategic innovation to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in protein engineering and can guide future efforts to design stable, highly active enzymes with defined structure&#8208;function relationships.







Abstract
Industrial fermentation applications typically require enzymes that exhibit high stability and activity at high temperatures. However, efforts to simultaneously improve these properties are usually limited by a trade&#8208;off between stability and activity. This report describes a computational strategy to enhance both activity and thermal stability of the mesophilic organophosphate&#8208;degrading enzyme, methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). To predict hotspot mutation sites, we assembled a library of features associated with the target properties for each residue and then prioritized candidate sites by hierarchical clustering. Subsequent in silico screening with multiple algorithms to simulate selective pressures yielded a subset of 23&#8197;candidate mutations. Iterative parallel screening of mutations that improved thermal stability and activity yielded, MPHase&#8208;m5b, which exhibited 13.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm and 4.2&#8197;times higher catalytic activity than wild&#8208;type (WT) MPH over a wide temperature range. Systematic analysis of crystal structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations revealed a wider entrance to the active site that increased substrate access with an extensive network of interactions outside the active site that reinforced &#945;&#946;/&#946;&#945; sandwich architecture to improve thermal stability. This study thus provides an advanced, rational design framework to improve efficiency in engineering highly active, thermostable biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Curvature Formation in Synthetic Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bilayer&#8208;forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath et&#8197;al., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water&#8208;exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life&#8208;like materials and artificial cells.







Abstract
The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine&#8208;terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life&#8208;like materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored molecular trap with optimal oxygen sites distribution is fabricated for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene isomers. Based on the specific molecular length recognition, simultaneous ultra&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) are achieved in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption.







Abstract
Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8211;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8722;C4H2O&#8722;CO2], featuring an effective pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>A Photocrosslinking Probe to Capture the Substrates of Caseinolytic Protease P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy using trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) and capture substrates within the barrel via a photocrosslinking moiety upon UV irradiation. The probes retain protease activity and capture numerous known and novel substrates of ClpP, allowing the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.







Abstract
Protein homeostasis in bacteria is regulated by proteases such as the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). Although substrates of ClpP have been successfully deciphered in genetically engineered cells, methods which directly trap processed proteins within native cells remain elusive. Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy which utilizes trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of ClpP and capture adjacent substrates with an attached photocrosslinking moiety. After enrichment using an alkyne handle, substrate deconvolution by mass spectrometry (MS) is performed. We show that our two traps bind substoichiometrically to ClpP, retain protease activity, exhibit unprecedented selectivity for Staphylococcus aureus ClpP in living cells and capture numerous known and novel substrates. The exemplary validation of trapped hits using a targeted proteomics approach confirmed the fidelity of this technology. In conclusion, we provide a novel chemical platform suited for the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Chemistry in Aqueous Ammonium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.

         <title>Front Cover: Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonylation reactions introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) into a molecule to produce key chemicals including carboxylic acids, esters, and amides that are abundant in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and plastics. In their Research Article (e202410928), Robert S. Paton, Garret M. Miyake et al. developed a photocatalytic carbonylation strategy, which enables the conversion of alkyl halides to esters or amides under metal&#8208;free conditions. Additionally, this strategy allows for complete incorporation of the 13C isotope.
