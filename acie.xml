         <title>Exploration of the Reactivity of Multivalent Electrophiles for Affinity Labeling: Sulfonyl Fluoride as a Highly Efficient and Selective Label</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical probes were prepared by multivalently presenting electrophilic groups and ligands on gold nanoparticles (NPs), and their reactivities as novel affinity labeling probes were explored. An arylsulfonyl fluoride probe at a nm concentration achieved an efficient and selective labeling of model proteins in cell lysate. The NP&#8208;immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride groups can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site.







Abstract
Here we explored the reactivity of a set of multivalent electrophiles cofunctionalized with a carbohydrate ligand on gold nanoparticles to achieve efficient affinity labeling for target protein analysis. Evaluation of the reactivity and selectivity of the electrophiles against three different cognate binding proteins identified arylsulfonyl fluoride as the most efficient protein&#8208;reactive group in this study. We demonstrated that multivalent arylsulfonyl fluoride probe 4 at 50&#8197;nm concentration achieved selective affinity labeling and enrichment of a model protein PNA in cell lysate, which was more effective than photoaffinity probe 1 with arylazide group. Labeling site analysis by LC&#8211;MS/MS revealed that the nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride group can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site of the target proteins. Our study highlights the utility of arylsulfonyl fluoride as a highly effective multivalent affinity label suitable for covalently capturing unknown target proteins.

         <title>An Organic Host&#8211;Guest System Producing Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence at the Parts&#8208;Per&#8208;Billion Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluorescent naphthalimides, which did not originally show observable phosphorescence, can now efficiently produce ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in phthalimide hosts. In particular, red RTP is realized by doping at a guest&#8208;to&#8208;host ratio at the 10&#8197;parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) level.







Abstract
Manipulation of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons in organic molecules is key to applications including next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, background&#8208;free bioimaging, information encryption, and photodynamic therapy. However, for organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), which stems from triplet excitons, it is still difficult to simultaneously achieve efficiency and lifetime enhancement on account of weak spin&#8211;orbit coupling and rapid nonradiative transitions, especially in the red and near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, we report that a series of fluorescent naphthalimides&#8212;which did not originally show observable phosphorescence in solution, as aggregates, in polymer films, or in any other tested host material, including heavy&#8208;atom matrices at cryogenic temperatures&#8212;can now efficiently produce ultralong RTP (&#981;=0.17, &#964;=243&#8197;ms) in phthalimide hosts. Notably, red RTP (&#955;RTP=628&#8197;nm) is realized at a molar ratio of less than 10&#8197;parts per billion, demonstrating an unprecedentedly low guest&#8208;to&#8208;host ratio where efficient RTP can take place in molecular solids.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Highly Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes via &#8220;&#224; la carte&#8221; Multifunctionalization of Borylated Dendralenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tetra&#8208;component reaction between a borylated dendralene, an organolithium reagent and two different electrophiles is reported. The method allows for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes with &#8220;&#224; la carte&#8221; introduction of diverse functionalities which serve as a versatile handle to access complex dienic structures.







Abstract
Despite the high relevance of 1,3&#8208;dienes, stereoselective methods to access tetrasubstituted conjugated dienes are still scarce. We here report an efficient and modular approach that provides access to multifunctional tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. This methodology is based on a tetracomponent reaction between a borylated dendralene, an organolithium reagent and two different electrophiles. Mechanistic studies reveal that this transformation proceeds through a regio&#8208; and stereoselective carbolithiation/electrophilic trapping of an in situ formed dendralenic boron&#8208;ate complex, followed by a stereoretentive halodeborylation. The ease in which complex structural dienes can be accessed and their synthetic versatility highlight the importance and utility of this method.

         <title>Selective N&#8208;Arylation of p&#8208;Aminophenylalanine in Unprotected Peptides with Organometallic Palladium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;formed oxidative addition complexes (OACs) are utilized to selectively arylate p&#8208;aminophenylalanine (pAF) in the presence of native functional groups, except cysteine. In phosphate buffer pH&#8197;7.5, OACs derived from electron&#8208;poor arenes provide full conversion in as little as 2&#8197;hours at micromolar concentration. A complimentary procedure using the weak base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN) is also presented enabling arylation with electron&#8208;rich substrates with up to 97&#8201;% conversion.







Abstract
The selective N&#8208;arylation of p&#8208;aminophenylalanine in polypeptides with pre&#8208;formed palladium oxidative addition complexes is described. The depressed pKa of the aniline NH2 group enables chemoselective C&#8722;N bond formation on peptides containing multiple other aliphatic amino groups at lysines or the N&#8208;terminus via Curtin&#8211;Hammett control under mild conditions. Using palladium complexes derived from electron&#8208;poor aryl halides, p&#8208;aminophenylalanine is fully arylated in aqueous buffer in as little as one hour at micromolar concentrations. A complementary protocol using the non&#8208;nucleophilic, organic base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN), expands the substrate scope to tolerate electron&#8208;rich functional groups provides up to 97&#8201;% conversion. These procedures enable the chemoselective conjugation of functionally diverse small molecule pharmaceuticals to p&#8208;aminophenylalanine containing derivatives of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.

         <title>Au/Pt&#8208;Egg&#8208;in&#8208;Nest Nanomotor for Glucose&#8208;Powered Catalytic Motion and Enhanced Molecular Transport to Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow Au/Pt&#8208;based nanostructures, resembling an &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology, have been synthesized by a dynamic&#8208;casting approach utilizing a silica yolk&#8208;shell cast. These nanosized motors can propel themselves in response to biocompatible glucose as fuel, via a catalytic cascade oxidation reaction. In response to autonomous motion, they can effectively internalize into living cells, and deliver the cargo anti&#8208;cancer drug molecules efficiently.







Abstract
Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt&#8208;based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology (Au/Pt&#8208;ENs), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme&#8208;relay&#8208;like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular&#8208;laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic&#8208;casting approach using silica yolk&#8208;shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au&#8208;seed fixing the silica&#8208;yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt&#8208;dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest&#8208;like morphology, Au/Pt&#8208;ENs exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose&#8208;converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor&#8208;membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of Au/Pt&#8208;ENs facilitated the drug&#8208;molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.

These nanosized motors can propel themselves in response to biocompatible glucose as fuel, via a catalytic cascade oxidation reaction. In response to autonomous motion, they can effectively internalize into living cells, and deliver the cargo anti-cancer drug molecules efficiently.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt-based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8220;egg-in-nest&#8221; morphology (&lt;b&gt;Au/Pt-EN&lt;/b&gt;s), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme-relay-like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular-laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic-casting approach using silica yolk-shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au-seed fixing the silica-yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt-dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest-like morphology, &lt;b&gt;Au/Pt-EN&lt;/b&gt;s exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose-converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor-membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of &lt;b&gt;Au/Pt-EN&lt;/b&gt;s facilitated the drug-molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoactivated In Situ Generation of Near Infrared Cyanines for Spatiotemporally Controlled Fluorescence Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis of a Cy5 fluorophore via carbon radical&#8208;participating trimerization, was designed by virtue of the self&#8208;photocatalytic activity of 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole derivatives. The in situ photochemical reaction was achieved selectively in lysosomes of living cells in an irradiation time&#8208;dependent manner, potentially applicable for spatiotemporally controlled fluorescence imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Photoactivated trimerization of 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole derivatives created near infrared fluorophore Cy5. The synthetic method is air&#8208;tolerant, photosensitizer free, metal free, and condensation agent free. Living cells make Cy5 on a time scale of minutes under white light irradiation at a low power intensity, with the monomer as the only exogenous agent. The new method is promising to find applications in cell studies for in situ spatiotemporally controlled fluorescence imaging in living cells.

         <title>Cleavage of the N&#8801;N Triple Bond and Unpredicted Formation of the Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diaza&#8208;2,4&#8208;Diborete (FB)2N2 from N2 and Fluoroborylene BF</title>

         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;membered heterocycle FB(&#956;&#8208;N)2BF is obtained from fluoroborylene, FB, and N2. It shows a complete cleavage of the N2 triple bond and a delocalized aromatic two&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;bond conjugated with the exo&#8208;cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs, indicating the importance of fluorine&#8208;specific interactions.







Abstract
A complete cleavage of the triple bond of N2 by fluoroborylene (:BF) was achieved in a low&#8208;temperature N2 matrix by the formation of the four&#8208;membered heterocycle FB(&#956;&#8208;N)2BF, which lacks a trans&#8208;annular N&#8722;N bond. Additionally, the linear complex FB=N&#8722;N=BF and cyclic FB(&#951;2&#8208;N2) were formed. These novel species were characterized by their matrix infrared spectra and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The puckered four&#8208;membered&#8208;ring B2N2 complex shows a delocalized aromatic two&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;system in conjugation with the exo&#8208;cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs. This work may contribute to a rational design of catalysts based on borylene for artificial dinitrogen activation.

         <title>Tissue Fluid Triggered Enzyme Polymerization for Ultrafast Gelation and Cartilage Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  in&#8208;situ  gelation of injectable precursors is desirable in the field of tissue regeneration, especially in the context of irregular defect filling. The current driving forces for fast gelation include the phase&#8208;transition of thermally sensitive copolymers, click chemical reactions with tissue components, and metal coordination effect. However, the rapid formation of tough hydrogels remains a challenge. Inspired by aerobic metabolism, we herein propose a tissue&#8208;fluid&#8208;triggered cascade enzymatic polymerization process catalyzed by glucose oxidase and ferrous glycinate for the ultrafast gelation of acryloylated chondroitin sulfates and acrylamides. The highly efficient production of carbon radicals and macromolecules contribute to auto&#8208;accelerated polymerization for soft tissue augmentation in bone defects. The copolymer hydrogel demonstrated the regeneration&#8208;promoting capacity of cartilage. As the first example of using artificial enzyme complexes for  in&#8208;situ  polymerization, this work offers a biomimetic approach to the design of strength&#8208;adjustable hydrogels for bio&#8208;implanting and bio&#8208;printing applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential.&#160;However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron&#8208;scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here, we report a low&#8208;temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect&#8208;rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them as electrocatalysts for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)  3  O  4  &#160;HEOs nanosheets deliver improved electrocatalytic activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high&#8208;temperature method. Our methodology could not only open new opportunities for investigating the properties of HEOs, but also be applicable for the discovery of nanostructured materials with great potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Copper Chaperone NosL forms a Heterometal Site for Cu Delivery to Nitrous Oxide Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The final step of denitrification is the reduction of nitrous oxide (N  2  O) to N  2  , mediated by Cu&#8208;dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N  2  OR). Its metal centers, Cu  A  and Cu  Z  , are assembled through sequential provision of twelve Cu(I) ions by a metallochaperone that forms part of a  nos  gene cluster encoding the enzyme and its accessory factors. The chaperone is the  nosL  gene product, an 18 kDa lipoprotein predicted to reside in the outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In order to better understand the assembly of N  2  OR, we have produced NosL from  Shewanella denitrificans  and determined the structure of the metal&#8208;loaded chaperone by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protein assembled a hetero&#173;di&#173;nuclear metal site consisting of Zn(II) and Cu(I), as evidenced by anomalous X&#8208;ray scattering. While only Cu(I) is delivered to the enzyme, the stabilizing presence of Zn(II) is essential for the functionality and structural integrity of the chaperone.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting photocatalytic water oxidation over bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting provides an economically feasible way for converting solar energy into hydrogen. Great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photocatalysts; however, the surface catalytic reactions, especially for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remains as a big challenge, which limits the overall photocatalytic energy efficiency. Here, we design a kind of Rhn cluster cocatalyst, with bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites anchoring on the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 model photocatalytic system. The resultant photocatalyst enables a super high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity of 7.11 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37% at 420 nm. Besides, the turnover frequency (TOF) value of the excellent photocatalyst could achieve 416.73 h&#8208;1, which is 378 times higher than that of the photocatalyst only decorated with Rh3+ species. The experimental and theoretical results unambiguously demonstrate the existence of stable isolated Rhn cocatalyst with Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, and the operando X&#8208;ray absorption characterization proves the OER process on the bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites. The density functional theoretical calculations further illustrate a bifunctional OER mechanism over the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites with assistance of a hydrogen atom transfer to the Rh0 sites, thus breaking the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates. This work demonstrates the potential of bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites to circumvent the OER scaling relationship to construct high&#8208;performance photocatalysts or photoelectrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;based Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers with Dual Active Sites for Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although being attractive materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER) under neutral or acidic conditions, conjugated polymers still show poor PEC HER performance in alkaline medium due to the lack of water dissociation sites. Herein, we demonstrate that tailoring the polymer skeleton from poly(diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET) to poly(2,6&#8208;diethynylbenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene (pBDT) and poly(diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]thiophene) (pDTT) in conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) introduces highly efficient active sites for water dissociation. As a result, pDTT and pBDT, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170 &#181;A cm&#8208;2 and 120 &#181;A cm&#8208;2 (at 0.3 V vs. RHE; pH 13), which are 4.2 and 3 times higher than that of pDET, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron&#8208;enriched C&#946; of the outer thiophene rings of pDTT are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Alkenes Using a Nanostructured Ni&#8208;Core&#8211;Shell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation and deuteration of olefins made easy: A core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;nanocatalyst (Ni&#8201;NPs@C) allows the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of alkenes under ambient conditions (1&#8197;bar H2/D2, room temperature).







Abstract
A general protocol for the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of a variety of alkenes is presented. Key to success for these reactions is the use of a specific nickel&#8208;graphitic shell&#8208;based core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured catalyst, which is conveniently prepared by impregnation and subsequent calcination of nickel nitrate on carbon at 450&#8201;&#176;C under argon. Applying this nanostructured catalyst, both terminal and internal alkenes, which are of industrial and commercial importance, were selectively hydrogenated and deuterated at ambient conditions (room temperature, using 1&#8197;bar hydrogen or 1&#8197;bar deuterium), giving access to the corresponding alkanes and deuterium&#8208;labeled alkanes in good to excellent yields. The synthetic utility and practicability of this Ni&#8208;based hydrogenation protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale reactions as well as efficient catalyst recycling experiments.

         <title>Anisotropic Synthetic Allomelanin Materials via Solid&#8208;State Polymerization of Self&#8208;Assembled 1,8&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to achieve synthetic melanin materials with various well&#8208;defined architectures, ranging from spheres to anisotropic sheets and ellipsoidal platelets, is described. The specific shapes are obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the building blocks of melanins, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to render polymeric materials without changing the overall morphology.







Abstract
Melanosomes in nature have diverse morphologies, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non&#8208;templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4&#8208;4&#8242;, 2&#8208;4&#8242; and 2&#8208;2&#8242;) were used as self&#8208;assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well&#8208;defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4&#8208;4&#8242; dimers. Solid&#8208;state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid&#8208;state polymerization.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Ultralong Phosphorescence with Lifetime over 5 s for Reversible Water&#8208;Jet Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials responsive to water have been achieved, showing phosphorescent quantum yield of 16.1&#8201;% and lifetime of 5.08&#8197;s. Lifetime&#8208;encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns are jet&#8208;printed using water as ink on the water&#8208;responsive OURTP paper and erased by solvent fuming with high reversibility and cycling stability.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with photophysical properties sensitive to external stimulus are highly attractive for advanced applications. However, most OURTP molecules are in crystal and OURTP materials with good practicability and stimulus&#8208;responsive character are hard to be achieved. Here, we report, for the first time, the highly efficient, ultralong&#8208;lived and deep&#8208;blue OURTP materials by simply doping boron phosphor into cyanuric acid host. Host&#8211;guest OURTP composites with abundant and tunable H&#8208;bond network are highly stable in air with ultralong lifetime of 5.08&#8197;s at room temperature. They are sensitive to water, which can strength the H&#8208;bond network to significantly enhance OURTP quantum yield from 16.1&#8201;% to 37.6&#8201;%. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper was easily prepared for water&#8208;jet printing; the jet&#8208;printed high&#8208;resolution OURTP patterns can be easily erased by solvent fuming for another printing/erasing cycle with high reversibility.

However, most OURTP molecules are in crystal and OURTP materials with good practicability and stimulus-responsive character are hard to be achieved. Here, we report, for the first time, the highly efficient, ultralong-lived and deep-blue OURTP materials by simply doping boron phosphor into cyanuric acid host. Host&#8211;guest OURTP composites with abundant and tunable H-bond network are highly stable in air with ultralong lifetime of 5.08&#8197;s at room temperature. They are sensitive to water, which can strength the H-bond network to significantly enhance OURTP quantum yield from 16.1&#8201;% to 37.6&#8201;%. Anti-counterfeiting paper was easily prepared for water-jet printing; the jet-printed high-resolution OURTP patterns can be easily erased by solvent fuming for another printing/erasing cycle with high reversibility.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on Cluster Formation: Pentamer, Hexamers and Heptamer of Difluoromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;limit of cluster investigation is pushed forward in this high&#8208;resolution gas phase rotational spectroscopy study. First detection of a pentamer, two hexamers and one heptamer of difluoromethane, through a synergic work of theoretical protocols and advanced experiments. This intricate balance of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions is analyzed in&#8208;depth.







Abstract
The role of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) has broadened with the inclusion of new types of interactions and a plethora of weak donor/acceptor partners. This work illustrates the potential of chirped&#8208;pulse Fourier transform microwave technique, which has revolutionized the field of rotational spectroscopy. In particular, it has been exploited to reveal the role of NCIs&#8217; in the molecular self&#8208;aggregation of difluoromethane where a pentamer, two hexamers and a heptamer were detected. The development of a new automated assignment program and a sophisticated computational screening protocol was essential for identifying the homoclusters in conditions of spectral congestion. The major role of dispersion forces leads to less directional interactions and more distorted structures than those found in polar clusters, although a detailed analysis demonstrates that the dominant interaction energy is the pairwise interaction. The tetramer cluster is identified as a structural unit in larger clusters, representing the maximum expression of bond between dimers.

         <title>Dual Emission: Classes, Mechanisms, and Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;emission (DE) materials have found widespread use in the materials and life sciences. This systematic, tutorial Review offers a clear presentation of the phenomenon and highlights misinterpretations as well as further literature with the aim of promoting the further targeted development of DE materials.







Abstract
There has been much interest in dual&#8208;emission materials in the past few years for materials and life science applications; however, a systematic overview of the underlying processes is so&#8208;far missing. We resolve this issue herein by classifying dual&#8208;emission (DE) phenomena as relying on one emitter with two emitting states (DE1), two independent emitters (DE2), or two correlated emitters (DE3). Relevant DE mechanisms for materials science are then briefly described together with the electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which they occur. For further reading, references are given that offer detailed insight into the complex mechanistic aspects of the various DE processes or provide overviews on materials families or their applications. By avoiding ambiguities and misinterpretations, this systematic, insightful Review might inspire future targeted designs of DE materials.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Cyanide and Isocyanides from CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of K[N(SiMe3)2] with 13CO affords K13CN and O(SiMe3)2 under mild conditions. DFT calculations affirmed this reaction proceeds via an isocyanide intermediate. This was confirmed experimentally as the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR3)R&#8242;] (M=Li, K; R=Ph, Me; R&#8242;=alkyl, aryl) are shown to provide a facile route to the 19 13C labeled isocyanide RN13C and MOSiR3 generally in high yields.







Abstract
The reaction of K[N(SiMe3)2] with 13CO proceeds in C6D6 or THF affording K13CN and O(SiMe3)2 under mild conditions as confirmed by crystallographic characterization of K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)CN. Similarly reaction of the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR3)R&#8242;] (M=Li, K; R=Ph, Me; R&#8242;=alkyl, aryl) provides the corresponding 13C labeled isocyanide RN13C and MOSiR3, generally in high yields. In some instances, the use of the sterically bulky Ph3Si&#8208;substituent is required to preclude 1,2&#8208;silyl migration affording the silylcarbamoyl salt M[Me3SiC(O)NR&#8242;]. These reactions have been used to obtain 19 examples of 13C labelled isocyanides, and several examples of gram scale reactions are reported. The mechanism of the reactions is probed via reliable DFT calculations.

         <title>Identification of a Pyrrole Intermediate Which Undergoes C&#8208;Glycosidation and Autoxidation to Yield the Final Product in Showdomycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8208;nucleoside biosynthesis: The biosynthetic pathway of the C&#8208;nucleoside showdomycin was reconstituted in vitro. Key steps include cyclization of l&#8208;glutamine to yield an oxygen&#8208;labile pyrrole intermediate that serves as the substrate for C&#8208;glycosidation catalyzed by SdmA. Autoxidative maturation of the pyrrole nucleobase to the maleimide moiety of showdomycin can then proceed non&#8208;enzymatically.







Abstract
Showdomycin is a C&#8208;nucleoside bearing an electrophilic maleimide base. Herein, the biosynthetic pathway of showdomycin is presented. The initial stages of the pathway involve non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mediated assembly of a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid intermediate. This intermediate is prone to air oxidation whereupon it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to yield an imine of maleimide, which in turn yields the maleimide upon acidification. It is also shown that this pyrrole intermediate serves as the substrate for the C&#8208;glycosidase SdmA in the pathway. After coupling with ribose 5&#8208;phosphate, the resulting C&#8208;nucleoside undergoes a similar sequence of oxidation, decarboxylation and deamination to afford showdomcyin after exposure to air. These results suggest that showdomycin could be an artifact due to aerobic isolation; however, the autoxidation may also serve to convert an otherwise inert product of the biosynthetic pathway to an electrophilic C&#8208;nucleotide thereby endowing showdomycin with its observed bioactivities.

         <title>Silica Jar&#8208;with&#8208;Lid as Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Compartment for Enantioselective Synthesis inside Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructure (SiJAR) fitted with a Mn&#8208;silicate lid was fabricated through the highly controlled thermal solid&#8208;state conversion of a MnO nanocrystal at the inside of hollow SiO2 shell. The lid aperture&#8208;opening created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor accommodating catalytic metal nanocrystals and enzymes, which performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity inside living cells.







Abstract
Nanodevices, harvesting the power of synthetic catalysts and enzymes to perform enantioselective synthesis inside cell, have never been reported. Here, we synthesized round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructures (SiJARs) with a chemo&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;silicate lid. This was isolated as an intermediate structure during highly controlled solid&#8208;state nanocrystal&#8208;conversion at the arc&#8208;section of silica shell. Different catalytic noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru) were selectively modified on the lid&#8208;section through galvanic reactions. And, lid aperture&#8208;opening was regulated by mild acidic conditions or intracellular environment which accommodated the metal nanocrystals and enzymes, and in turn created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor. Distinct from the free enzymes, SiJARs performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity (yield &gt;99&#8201;%, ee=95&#8201;%) and also functioned as the artificial catalytic organelles inside living cells. This work bridges the enormous potential of sophisticated nanocrystal&#8208;conversion chemistry and advanced platforms for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Round bottom jar-like silica nanostructure (SiJAR) fitted with a Mn-silicate &lt;i&gt;lid&lt;/i&gt; was fabricated through the highly controlled thermal solid-state conversion of a MnO nanocrystal at the inside of hollow SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell. The &lt;i&gt;lid&lt;/i&gt; aperture-opening created an open-mouth nanoreactor accommodating catalytic metal nanocrystals and enzymes, which performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity inside living cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanodevices, harvesting the power of synthetic catalysts and enzymes to perform enantioselective synthesis inside cell, have never been reported. Here, we synthesized round bottom jar-like silica nanostructures (&lt;b&gt;SiJAR&lt;/b&gt;s) with a chemo-responsive metal-silicate &lt;i&gt;lid&lt;/i&gt;. This was isolated as an intermediate structure during highly controlled solid-state nanocrystal-conversion at the arc-section of silica shell. Different catalytic noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru) were selectively modified on the &lt;i&gt;lid&lt;/i&gt;-section through galvanic reactions. And, &lt;i&gt;lid&lt;/i&gt; aperture-opening was regulated by mild acidic conditions or intracellular environment which accommodated the metal nanocrystals and enzymes, and in turn created an open-mouth nanoreactor. Distinct from the free enzymes, &lt;b&gt;SiJAR&lt;/b&gt;s performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity (yield &amp;gt;99&#8201;%, &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;=95&#8201;%) and also functioned as the artificial catalytic organelles inside living cells. This work bridges the enormous potential of sophisticated nanocrystal-conversion chemistry and advanced platforms for new-to-nature catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Deformylation of 5&#8208;Formylcytidine in Different Cell Types</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of deformylation rates in different cell types and developmental states using a novel synthesis route towards 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;fdC shows that deformylation is a wide spread process that is inversely correlated with cell division.







Abstract
Epigenetic programming of cells requires methylation of deoxycytidines (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC) followed by oxidation to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC), and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). Subsequent transformation of fdC and cadC back to dC by various pathways establishes a chemical intra&#8208;genetic control circle. One of the discussed pathways involves the Tdg&#8208;independent deformylation of fdC directly to dC. Here we report the synthesis of a fluorinated fdC feeding probe (F&#8208;fdC) to study direct deformylation to F&#8208;dC. The synthesis was performed along a novel pathway that circumvents any F&#8208;dC as a reaction intermediate to avoid contamination interference. Feeding of F&#8208;fdC and observation of F&#8208;dC formation in vivo allowed us to gain insights into the Tdg&#8208;independent removal process. While deformylation was shown to occur in stem cells, we here provide data that prove deformylation also in different somatic cell types. We also investigated active demethylation in a non&#8208;dividing neurogenin&#8208;inducible system of iPS cells that differentiate into bipolar neurons.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Conjugated Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes has been realized for the synthesis of chiral propargylamines with high efficiency (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee and TON=2000). Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn2+ generated from zinc reduction of the CoII complex exhibits an activating effect for the initiation of the plausible CoI/CoIII catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation is one of the most powerful methods for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds. However, the chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of the relatively inert unsaturated group in substrates possessing multiple unsaturated bonds remains a challenge. We herein report a protocol for the highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes while keeping the alkynyl bond intact. Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn2+ generated from zinc reduction of the CoII complex plays a critical role to initiate a plausible CoI/CoIII catalytic cycle. This approach allows for the highly efficient generation of chiral propargylamines (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee and 2000 S/C) and further useful chemical transformations.

         <title>Scholl Reaction of Perylene&#8208;Based Polyphenylene Precursors under Different Conditions: Formation of Hexagon or Octagon?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that Scholl reaction of a bis&#8208;perylene precursor gave either a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or a negatively curved PAH embedded with octagons, which can be explained by a radical cation or an arenium ion mechanism under different reaction conditions. The formed molecules show non&#8208;aggregative feature and exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields.







Abstract
A planar dibenzo&#8208;peri&#8208;hexacene derivative (2) was synthesized via FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl reaction from a cyclopenta&#8208;fused perylene (CP) based polyphenylene precursor (1). However, an unexpected octagon&#8208;containing, negatively curved molecule (3) was obtained in nearly quantitative yield when 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and methanesulfonic acid (MeSO3H) were used. Similar results were observed when two smaller&#8208;sized precursors containing one (4) or two CP units (5) were tested. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis also revealed that there is no close &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between neighboring &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons. DFT calculations suggest a radical cation mechanism in the presence of FeCl3 while an arenium ion pathway for the DDQ/MeSO3H mediated Scholl reaction, which can well explain the selective formation of hexagons and octagons under different conditions. The obtained compounds showed tunable optical and electrochemical properties.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Thiocarbonylation of Alkynes toward Linear and Branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Thioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is reported. Various linear and branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters are produced in a straightforward manner. This protocol is characterized by its ligand&#8208;controlled regioselectivity pattern, wide substrate scope, and unprecedented functional group compatibility. This is the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.







Abstract
Thiocarbonylation of alkynes offers an ideal procedure for the synthesis of unsaturated thioesters. A robust ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is developed. Utilizing boronic acid and 5&#8208;chlorosalicylic acid as the acid additive to in situ form 5&#8208;chloroborosalicylic acid (5&#8208;Cl&#8208;BSA), and bis(2&#8208;diphenylphosphinophenyl)ether (DPEphos) as the ligand, linear &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters were produced in a straightforward manner. Switching the ligand to tri(2&#8208;furyl)phosphine can turn the reaction selectivity to give branched products. Remarkably, this approach also represents the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.

         <title>Development of a Borane&#8211;(Meth)acrylate Photo&#8208;Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8211;borane complexes can lead to a photochemically triggered borane&#8211;acrylate click reaction, a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction. Because boranes have three substituents they can participate to cross&#8208;linking, unlike thiols in thiol&#8211;(meth)acrylate reactions. This generates materials with improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
In the development of 3D printing fuels, there is a need for new photoinitiating systems working under mild conditions and/or leading to polymers with new and/or enhanced properties. In this context, we introduce herein N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8211;borane complexes as reagents for a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction, the borane&#8211;(meth)acrylate click reaction. Remarkably, the higher bond number of boranes relative to thiols induced an increase of the network density associated with faster polymerization kinetics. Solid&#8208;state NMR evidenced the strong participation of the boron centers on the network properties, while DMA and AFM showed that the materials exhibit improved mechanical properties, as well as reduced solvent swelling.

&lt;p&gt;In the development of 3D printing fuels, there is a need for new photoinitiating systems working under mild conditions and/or leading to polymers with new and/or enhanced properties. In this context, we introduce herein N-heterocyclic carbene&#8211;borane complexes as reagents for a new type of photo-click reaction, the borane&#8211;(meth)acrylate click reaction. Remarkably, the higher bond number of boranes relative to thiols induced an increase of the network density associated with faster polymerization kinetics. Solid-state NMR evidenced the strong participation of the boron centers on the network properties, while DMA and AFM showed that the materials exhibit improved mechanical properties, as well as reduced solvent swelling.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Switchable Catalysis for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Cyclic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a switchable catalytic system that involves ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides/anhydrides/CO2 and photo&#8208;induced intramolecular radical addition has been demonstrated. It enabled the direct synthesis of well&#8208;defined cyclic polyesters and cyclic CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates from mixtures of monomers in an efficient process.







Abstract
A cobalt salen pentenoate complex [salen=(R,R)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine] is rationally designed as the catalyst for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides/CO2. Via migratory insertion of carbon monoxide (CO) into the Co&#8722;O bonds, the ROCOP&#8208;active species &#945;&#8208;alkene&#8208;&#969;&#8208;O&#8208;CoIII(salen) can be rapidly and quantitatively transformed into &#945;&#8208;alkene&#8208;&#969;&#8208;O2C&#8208;CoIII(salen) telechelic linear precursors. Upon dilution of reaction mixtures, the homolytic cleavage of Co&#8722;C bonds induced by visible light generates &#945;&#8208;alkene acyl radicals that spontaneously undergo intramolecular radical addition to afford organocobalt&#8208;functionalized cyclic polyesters and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates with excellent regioselectivity. The cyclic products can either react with radical scavengers to generate metal&#8208;free cyclic polymers or serve as photo&#8208;initiators for organometallic&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (OMRP) to produce tadpole&#8208;shaped copolymers.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Ionization Induced Stable White Organic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic long persistent luminescence with afterglow lasting up to 20&#8211;40&#8197;minutes was achieved based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism at room temperature in a simple binary system. Through modulation of molecular structures and potential ISC channels between excited states, the afterglow profiles can be rationally tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46).







Abstract
Organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials with afterglow duration in the scale of minutes or even hours are still rare. Most OLPL systems are based on exciplexes, which require complicated multi&#8208;component system in order to realize white afterglow but with slightly compromised duration and color stability. In this work, OLPLs lasting from 20 to 40 minutes are realized in a simple binary system based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism, which can simultaneously harvest excitons from both singlet and triplet excited states, making it potentially one of the most promising candidates to achieve stable white OLPL. Through modulation and optimization of dopant molecules in dibenzo[b,d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yldiphenyl phosphine oxide host, the emission profiles of afterglow can be readily tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46), with excellent color consistency.

         <title>Phenacyl Phenothiazinium Salt as a New Broad&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Absorbing Photoinitiator for Cationic and Free Radical Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new single component broad&#8208;band photoinitiator absorbing light at UV, Visible and Near&#8208;IR region for the initiation of free radical, cationic and hybrid polymerizations. This new photoinitiator may expand the curing application range of formulations of various pigmented systems.







Abstract
A novel broad&#8208;wavelength&#8208;absorbing photoinitiator based on phenacyl phenothiazinium hexafluroantimonate (P&#8208;PTh) possessing both phenacyl and phenothiazine chromophoric groups was reported. P&#8208;PTh absorbs light at UV, Visible and Near&#8208;IR region. Photophysical, photochemical, and computational investigations revealed that P&#8208;PTh in solution decomposes at all wavelengths by homolytic and heterolytic cleavages and generates cationic and radical species, which could efficiently initiate cationic and free radical polymerizations. It is anticipated that the photoinitiator with such wavelength flexibility may open up new pathways in curing applications of formulations of pigment systems.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of Acid&#8208;Free Neutral Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane has been prepared via a serendipitous discovery, from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf in which the shortest B=O distance observed so far has been measured, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of an acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane of the type carboranyl&#8208;B(carbene)=O has been developed via a serendipitous discovery from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf. This represents a new type of oxoborane. The stabilization of this oxoborane may be attributed to 1)&#8197;kinetic stabilization provided by a bulky 3D carboranyl ligand and 2)&#8197;thermodynamic stabilization offered by a carbene ligand. Crystallographic analyses support the presence of the shortest terminal B=O double bond ever reported thus far. Its reactivity has also been examined.

         <title>Interfacial Microenvironment Modulation Boosting Electron Transfer between Metal Nanoparticles and MOFs for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), are encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Systemic investigations suggest that the PVP presents negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF, and the PVP removal greatly boosts photocatalysis.







Abstract
Interfacial electron transfer between cocatalyst and photosensitizer is key in heterogeneous photocatalysis, yet the underlying mechanism remains subtle and unclear. Surfactant coated on the metal cocatalysts, greatly modulating the microenvironment of catalytic sites, is largely ignored. Herein, a series of Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), were encapsulated into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, to afford PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PtrPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, and Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The PVP appears to have a negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF. Compared with PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the removal of interfacial PVP improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, boosting photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Compared with Pt&lt;sub&gt;PVP&lt;/sub&gt;@UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the removal of interfacial PVP improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, boosting photocatalytic hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strategic Design of Catalytic Lysine&#8208;Targeting Reversible Covalent BCR&#8208;ABL Inhibitors**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using iminoboronate chemistry, we report the first successful examples of catalytic lysine&#8208;targeting reversible covalent BCR&#8208;ABL inhibitors which inhibited both ABLWT and ABLT315I at nanomolar potency. We also demonstrated how the study of off&#8208;targets for this class of compounds could be performed using activity&#8208;based protein profiling and mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibitors have re&#8208;emerged as validated drugs to overcome acquired resistance in cancer treatment. Herein, by using a carbonyl boronic acid (CBA) warhead, we report the structure&#8208;based design of BCR&#8208;ABL inhibitors via reversible covalent targeting of the catalytic lysine with improved potency against both wild&#8208;type and mutant ABL kinases, especially ABLT315I bearing the gatekeeper residue mutation. We show the evolutionarily conserved lysine can be targeted selectively, and the selectivity depends largely on molecular recognition of the non&#8208;covalent pharmacophore in this class of inhibitors, probably due to the moderate reactivity of the warhead. We report the first co&#8208;crystal structures of covalent inhibitor&#8208;ABL kinase domain complexes, providing insights into the interaction of this warhead with the catalytic lysine. We also employed label&#8208;free mass spectrometry to evaluate off&#8208;targets of our compounds at proteome&#8208;wide level in different mammalian cells.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Templated Coupling of B=N Units: Synthesis of BNBN Analogues of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and a Butatriene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [&#956;&#8208;(dmpm)Pt]2 template promotes the coupling of B=N units derived from dihalo(silylamino)borane precursors by B&#8722;N bond formation through intermolecular halosilane elimination. For Cl2BNR(SiMe3) &#951;1&#8208;(N&#8208;aminoboryl)aminoboryl and &#951;1&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;diazaboretidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl PtI2 complexes are obtained, whereas for Br2BN(SiMe3)2 an A&#8208;frame complex bridged by the first BNBN analogue of a butatriene is formed, as confirmed by structural and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
The 1:2 reaction of [&#956;&#8208;(dmpm)Pt(nbe)]2 (dmpm=bis(dimethylphosphino)methane, nbe=norbornene) with Cl2BNR(SiMe3) (R=tBu, SiMe3) yields unsymmetrical (N&#8208;aminoboryl)aminoboryl PtI2 complexes by B&#8722;N coupling via ClSiMe3 elimination. A subsequent intramolecular ClSiMe3 elimination from the tBu&#8208;derivative leads to cyclization of the BNBN unit, forming a unique 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand. In contrast, the analogous reaction with Br2BN(SiMe3)2 leads, via a twofold BrSiMe3 elimination, to a PtII2 A&#8208;frame complex bridged by a linear BNBN isostere of butatriene. Structural and computational data confirm &#960;&#8197;electron delocalization over the entire BNBN unit.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Hydroamination of Push&#8211;Pull&#8208;Activated Linear Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and regioselective click reaction between N,N&#8208;dialkylhydroxylamines and linear alkynes is described. This bioorthogonal reaction between two small components is enabled by the rehybridization effect of terminally halogenated alkynes and the careful balancing of alkyne &#960;&#8208;electron density through a push&#8211;pull mechanism.







Abstract
A bioorthogonal reaction between N,N&#8208;dialkylhydroxylamines and push&#8211;pull&#8208;activated halogenated alkynes is described. We explore the use of rehybridization effects in activating alkynes, and we show that electronic effects, when competing stereoelectronic and inductive factors are properly balanced, sufficiently activate a linear alkyne in the uncatalyzed conjugative retro&#8208;Cope elimination reaction while adequately protecting it against cellular nucleophiles. This design preserves the low steric profile of an alkyne and pairs it with a comparably unobtrusive hydroxylamine. The kinetics are on par with those of the fastest strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions, the products regioselectively formed, the components sufficiently stable and easily installed, and the reaction suitable for cellular labeling.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis with Telluronium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding results from non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid but Te&#8208;based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalyst. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic property at low loading in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8208;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder between Danishefsky&#8217;s diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi&#8208;nuclear (  17  O,  31  P and  125  Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling cysteine&#8208;free native chemical ligation at challenging junctions with a ligation auxiliary capable of base catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a Mn(II) complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemistry and Microstructure Perspective on Ion Conducting Membranes for Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with decoupled control over power and energy are known as one of the most promising grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. However, the development of RFBs with high round&#8208;trip efficiency, high rate capability and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of appropriate ion conducting membranes. Promising RFB membranes should separate positive and negative species completely and conduct balancing ions smoothly, and it is also critical to meet the additional requirements in specific systems, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with the emphasis on the new chemistry, novel microstructure, and innovative fabrication strategy. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Beam search for automated design and scoring of novel ROR ligands with machine intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical language models enable de novo drug design without the requirement for explicit molecular construction rules. While such models have been applied to generate novel compounds with desired bioactivity, the actual prioritization and selection of the most promising computational designs remains challenging. In this work, we leveraged the probabilities learnt by chemical language models with the beam search algorithm as a model&#8208;intrinsic technique for automated molecule design and scoring. Prospective application of this method yielded three novel inverse agonists of retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptors (RORs). Each design was synthesizable in three reaction steps and presented low&#8208;micromolar to nanomolar potency towards ROR&#947;. This model&#8208;intrinsic sampling technique eliminates the strict need for external compound scoring functions, thereby further extending the applicability of generative artificial intelligence to data&#8208;driven drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoid with Zwitterion Cysteamine Linker and Its Crystal&#8208;Crystal Transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate synthesis of a new low&#8208;D hybrid perovskitoid (a perovskite&#8208;like hybrid halide structure, yellow crystals, P21/n space group) using zwitterion cysteamine (2&#8208;aminoethanethiol) linker, and its remarkable molecular diffusion&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase (Red crystals, Pnma space group). Our stable intermediate perovskitoid distinctly differs from all previous reports by way of a unique staggered arrangement of holes in the puckered 2D configuration with a face&#8208;sharing connection between the corrugated&#8208;1D double chains. The PL intensity for the yellow phase is 5 orders higher as compared to the red phase and the corresponding average lifetime is also fairly long (143 ns). First principles DFT calculations conform very well with the experimental band gap data. We demonstrate applicability of the new perovskitoid yellow phase as an excellent active layer in a self&#8208;powered photodetector and for selective detection of Ni2+ via On&#8208;Off&#8208;On photoluminescence (PL) based on its composite with few layer black phosphorous.</dc:description>

         <title>"Repaired and Activated" DNAzyme Enables the Monitoring of DNA Alkylation Repair in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct measurement of DNA repair is critical for the annotation of their clinical relevance and the discovery of drugs for cancer therapy.  Here we reported a "repaired and activated" DNAzyme (RADzyme) by incorporating a single methyl lesion (O  6  MeG, 3MeC, or 1MeA) at designated positions through systematic screening  . We found that the catalytic activity of the RADzyme was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair. Benefit from these findings, a fluorogenic RADzyme sensor was developed for the monitoring of MGMT&#8208;mediated repair of O  6  MeG lesion. Importantly, the sensor allowed the evaluation of MGMT repair activity in different cells and under drugs treatment. Furthermore, another RADzyme sensor was engineered for the monitoring of ALKBH2&#8208;mediated repair of 3MeC lesion. This strategy provides a simple and versatile tool for the study of the basic biology of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide&#8208;modifying Radical SAM Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminomalonate (Ama) is a widespread structural motif in Nature, whereas its biosynthetic route is only partially understood. In this study, we show that a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in cyclophane biosynthesis exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity. This enzyme, named three&#8208;residue cyclophane forming enzyme (3&#8208;CyFE), mainly produces cyclophane in vivo, whereas it produces formylglycine (FGly) as a major product and barely produce cyclophane in vitro. Importantly, the enzyme can further oxidize FGly to produce Ama. Bioinformatics study revealed that 3&#8208;CyFEs have evolved from a common ancestor with anaerobic sulfatase maturases (anSMEs), and possess a similar set of catalytic residues with anSMEs. Remarkably, the enzyme does not need leader peptide for activity and is fully active on a truncated peptide containing only 5 amino acids of the core sequence. Our work discloses the first ribosomal path towards Ama formation, providing a possible hint for the rich occurrence of Ama in Nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel phthalocyanine molecules as active sites were installed into nickel&#8208;catecholate&#8208;linked 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets for efficient CO2 electroreduction with nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising approach to realize a carbon&#8208;energy balance. However, low current density still limits the application of the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one class of promising alternatives for the CO2RR due to their periodically arranged isolated metal active sites. However, the poor conductivity of traditional MOFs usually results in a low current density in CO2RR. We have prepared conductive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine&#8208;based MOF (NiPc&#8208;NiO4) nanosheets linked by nickel&#8208;catecholate, which can be employed as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2RR to CO. The obtained NiPc&#8208;NiO4 has a good conductivity and exhibited a very high selectivity of 98.4&#8201;% toward CO production and a large CO partial current density of 34.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming the reported MOF catalysts. This work highlights the potential of conductive crystalline frameworks in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Nano&#8208;Superstructure towards Enzyme Mimicking Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peptide nano&#8208;superstructure employs a cyclic dipeptide as a building block, is inspired by the coffee roasting process, and can be easily synthesized. The self&#8208;assembled biocatalyst displays enzyme&#8208;like hydrolysis activity, with exceptional stability and recyclability. This catalytic peptide assembly provides a potent complement for minimalistic biocatalysts and offers an attractive alternative to the current arsenal of natural metalloenzymes.







Abstract
The structural arrangement of amino acid residues in native enzymes underlies their remarkable catalytic properties, thus providing a notable point of reference for designing potent yet simple biomimetic catalysts. Herein, we describe a minimalistic approach to construct a dipeptide&#8208;based nano&#8208;superstructure with enzyme&#8208;like activity. The self&#8208;assembled biocatalyst comprises one peptide as a single building block, readily synthesized from histidine. Through coordination with zinc ion, the peptide self&#8208;assembly procedure allows the formation of supramolecular &#946;&#8208;sheet ordered nanocrystals, which can be used as basic units to further construct higher&#8208;order superstructure. As a result, remarkable hydrolysis activity and enduring stability are demonstrated. Our work exemplifies the use of a bioinspired supramolecular assembly approach to develop next&#8208;generation biocatalysts for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B and Analogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immunosuppressive natural products, sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B, bearing a 22&#8208;membered macrocycle appended with a unique highly&#8208;substituted spirolactam, pose formidable challenges to synthetic accessibility and derivatization. A versatile strategy toward the spirolactam through convergent assembly of fully&#8208;functionalized fragments culminated in the total synthesis of sanglifehrin&#8197;A and sanglifehrin&#8197;B and preparation of additional analogs at position C40 for evaluation of biological activity in Jurkat cells and stabilization of protein&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
Sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B are immunosuppressive macrocyclic natural products endowed with and differentiated by a unique spirocyclic lactam. Herein, we report an enantioselective total synthesis and biological evaluation of sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B and analogs. Access to the spirocyclic lactam was achieved through convergent assembly of a key pyranone intermediate followed by a stereo&#8208;controlled spirocyclization. The 22&#8208;membered macrocyclic core was synthesized by ring&#8208;closing metathesis in the presence of 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl) benzeneboronic acid (BFBB). The spirocyclic lactam and macrocycle fragments were united by a Stille coupling to furnish sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B. Additional sanglifehrin B analogs with variation at the C40 position were additionally prepared. Biological evaluation revealed that the 2&#8208;CF3 analog of sanglifehrin B exhibited higher anti&#8208;proliferative activity than the natural products sanglifehrin&#8197;A and B in Jurkat cells. Both natural products induced higher&#8208;order homodimerization of cyclophilin&#8197;A (CypA), but only sanglifehrin&#8197;A promoted CypA complexation with inosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate dehydrogenase&#8197;2 (IMPDH2). The synthesis reported herein will enable further evaluation of the spirolactam and its contribution to sanglifehrin&#8208;dependent immunosuppressive activity.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation over Pd/ZnO&#8208;Based Catalysts: The Role of Palladium&#8211;Zinc Alloy in Selective Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this operando study of methanol synthesis over Pd/ZnO catalysts, we show that the palladium&#8211;zinc alloy phase by itself is not particularly good at selectively hydrogenating carbon dioxide. Instead, and in the absence of a co&#8208;existing zinc oxide phase, the palladium&#8211;zinc alloy primarily yields carbon monoxide. When zinc oxide and palladium&#8211;zinc alloy nanoparticles are both present, the system becomes a far more active and selective catalyst.







Abstract
Pd/ZnO catalysts show good activity and high selectivity to methanol during catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The Pd&#8208;Zn alloy phase has usually been considered as the active phase, though mechanistic studies under operando conditions have not been conducted to verify this. Here, we report a mechanistic study under realistic conditions of methanol synthesis, using in situ and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and time&#8208;resolved isotope labeling experiments coupled with FTIR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Pd&#8208;Zn alloy&#8208;based catalysts, prepared through reduction of a heterobimetallic PdIIZnII acetate bridge complex, and which do not contain zinc oxide or any PdZn/ZnO interface, produce mostly CO. The Pd&#8208;Zn phase is associated with the formation of CO, and does not provide the active sites required to produce methanol from the direct hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. The presence of a ZnO phase, in contact with a Pd&#8208;Zn phase, is essential for efficient methanol production.

         <title>Electro&#8208;mediated PhotoRedox Catalysis for Selective C(sp3)&#8208;O Cleavages of Phosphinated Alcohols to Carbanions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel example of electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis (e&#8208;PRC) in the reductive cleavage of C(sp  3  )&#8208;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions. As well as deoxygenations, olefinations are reported which are  E  &#8208;selective and can be made  Z  &#8208;selective in a tandem reduction/photosensitization process where both steps are photoelectrochemically promoted. Spectroscopy, computation and catalyst structural variations reveal that our new naphthalene monoimide&#8208;type catalyst allows for a more intimate dispersive precomplexation of its radical anion form with the phosphinate substrate, facilitating a reactivity&#8208;determining C(sp  3  )&#8208;O cleavage. Surprisingly and in contrast to previously reported photoexcited radical anion chemistries, our conditions i) tolerate aryl chlorides/bromides and ii) do not give rise to Birch&#8208;type reductions.</dc:description>

         <title>The hydrates of TEMPO: Water vibrations reveal radical microsolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organic radical monohydrate complex is detected in vacuum isolation at low temperature by FTIR supersonic jet spectroscopy for the first time. It is shown to exhibit a rich conformational and vibrational coupling dynamics, which can be drastically reduced by appropriate isotope substitution. Its detection with a new gas recycling infrared spectrometer demonstrates the thermal metastability of the gaseous TEMPO radical even under humid gas conditions. Compared to its almost isoelectronic and isostructural, closed shell ketone analog, the hydrogen bond of the solvating water is found to be less directional, but stronger and more strongly downshifting the bonded water OH stretch vibration. A second solvent water directs the first one into a metastable hydrogen bond position to solvate the nitrogen center and the first water at the same time.</dc:description>

         <title>From kinase inhibitors to multitarget ligands as powerful drug leads for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease using protein&#8208;templated synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are arising as promising tools to tackle complex diseases. The main goal of this work is to create powerful modulating agents for neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta&#8208;secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;&#8208;amyloid production. We obtained well&#8208;balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.</dc:description>

To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta-secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;-amyloid production. We obtained well-balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulphate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the straightforward preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulphate from commercially available AgF and OSF4  . The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN&#8208;solution. Apart from that, AgOSF5  has been further stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF5  &#8208;complexes with Ni(II), Cu(I) and Cu(II)&#8208;centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF5  has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF5  &#8208;groups to aryne&#8208;moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF5  &#8208;substituted arenes. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition metal OSF5  &#8208;compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8208;  anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Kirkendall Effect Boosts Phosphorylated nZVI for Efficient Heavy Metal Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radial nanocracks in phosphorylated nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) favor the facile inward diffusion of NiII and the rapid outward transport of electrons and ferrous ions through the oxide shell for surface (NiII/electron) and boundary (NiII/Fe0) galvanic exchange. Accompanied by a pronounced hollowing phenomenon, phosphorylated nZVI can instantly reduce and immobilize NiII throughout the oxide shell with a high capacity.







Abstract
Removal of non&#8208;biodegradable heavy metals has been the top priority in wastewater treatment and the development of green technologies remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate that phosphorylated nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) is promising for removal of heavy metals (NiII, CuII, CrVI, HgII) via a boosted Kirkendall effect. Phosphorylation confines tensile hoop stress on the nZVI particles and &#8220;breaks&#8221; the structurally dense spherical nZVI to produce numerous radial nanocracks. Exemplified by NiII removal, the radial nanocracks favor the facile inward diffusion of NiII and the rapid outward transport of electrons and ferrous ions through the oxide shell for surface (NiII/electron) and boundary (NiII/Fe0) galvanic exchange. Accompanied by a pronounced hollowing phenomenon, phosphorylated nZVI can instantly reduce and immobilize NiII throughout the oxide shell with a high capacity (258&#8197;mg&#8201;Ni&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;Fe). For real electroplating factory wastewater treatment, this novel nZVI performs simultaneous NiII and CuII removal, producing effluent of stable quality that meets local discharge regulations.

         <title>Ultralight Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralight electrolytes with a density of 0.83&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 were proposed by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether. A weight reduction of more than 30&#8201;% per volume was realized relative to the conventional electrolyte, also enabling Li&#8211;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. When applied in pouch cells, &#8776;20&#8201;% improvement in specific energy could be achieved at various E/S ratios.







Abstract
The high weight fraction of the electrolyte in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cell is the primary reason its specific energy is much below expectations. Thus far, it is still a challenge to reduce the electrolyte volume of Li&#8211;S batteries owing to their high cathode porosity and electrolyte depletion from the Li metal anode. Herein, we propose an ultralight electrolyte (0.83&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1) by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether, which greatly reduces the weight fraction of electrolyte within the whole cell and also enables Li&#8211;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. Compared to Li&#8211;S batteries using conventional counterparts (&#8776;1.2&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), the Li&#8211;S pouch cells equipped with our ultralight electrolyte could achieve an ultralow electrolyte weight/capacity ratio (E/C) of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1 and realize a 19.2&#8201;% improvement in specific energy (from 329.9 to 393.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) under E/S=3.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Moreover, more than 20&#8201;% improvement in specific energy could be achieved using our ultralight electrolyte at various E/S ratios.

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Here we illustrate photocatalytic performances of  N  ,  N  &#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (  PN  )&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded  2D&#8208;PN  COFs with slipped AA stacking and one  3D&#8208;PN  COF with a 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated pts topology were prepared. All seven COFs can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers possessing the combination of linear (  l  ) and cyclic (  c  ) repeat units, whereas the  2D&#8208;PN  COFs, especially  2D&#8208;PN&#8208;2&#8208;OMe  exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the  3D&#8208;PN  COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high  l  /  c  selectivity (up to 97%). The improved performance can be ascribed to that the 2D structure has a larger internal surface area, which can provide more catalytically active sites and promote the adsorption and concentration of reactants, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Chromism and Photoluminescence of Spiropyran&#8208;based Liquid Crystalline Polymer with Tunable Glass Transition Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiropyran&#8208;based materials (SPBMs) can give responses to the stimulations induced by the light, heat, force, or pH, which have been used as triggers for many smart materials. Here, a cross&#8208;linkable SPBM containing mesogenic&#8208;units is synthesized, which is pale&#8208;colored, non&#8208;photoluminescent and non&#8208;mesogenic at a spiro form, but dark&#8208;colored, photoluminescent, and mesogenic at a merocyanine form. Moreover, the dynamic interconversion behaviors of the form in the different chemical environments are distinct. Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) containing the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via a Vis&#8208;light, own a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (  T  g  ) and retain the switchable property; however, the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via a UV&#8208;light will be locked at the MC state, because the molecular movement was frozen at the room temperature lower than the given  T  g  of the LCP. Thus, programmable chromism and photoluminescence based on the tunable  T  g  can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial Coordination&#8208;Perturbed Bi&#8208;Copper Sites for Selective Elec&#8208;troreduction of CO2 to Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), finding out a stable, well&#8208;defined catalyst model system to survey carefully the influence of the synergistic effect between adjacent catalytical active sites on the selective generation of C  1  or C  2  products is highly important and challenging. In this work, we elaborately design and synthesize a stable crystalline single chain catalyst model system for electrochemical CO  2  RR, which involves four homomorphic one&#8208;dimensional chain&#8208;like compounds (  Cu&#8208;PzH  ,  Cu&#8208;PzCl  ,  Cu&#8208;PzBr  and  Cu&#8208;PzI  ). The main structural difference of these four chains is that the substituents of halogen atoms with different electronegativity on the Pz ligands coordinated by active Cu ions lead to its different coordination microenvironment. In these chains, the variations of coordination microenvironment induce the different synergistic effects, which refer to the different  D  Cu&#8208;Cu  (from 3.57 to 3.63 &#197;) and  &#946;  Cu&#8208;Cu  (from 74.48 to 70.87&#176;) between bi&#8208;copper centers, directly leading to regular FE  CH4  : FE  C2H4  changes from 1:6.5, 1: 2.3, 1:1.2 to 1:0.3. At &#8208;1.0 V (vs. RHE), the FE  C2H4  of  Cu&#8208;PzH  can reach up to 60%, which is the highest in Cu&#8208;based crystalline materials, while  Cu&#8208;PzI  exhibits the highest FE  CH4  of 52%. DFT calculations discovered that the selectivity difference of electrocatalytic products is attributed to the changes of the synergistic effect of bi&#8208;Cu centers and the upshift of d&#8208;band center after the coordination microenvironment variation. This work provides a simple and stable crystalline single chain model system for systematically studying the important influence of the coordination microenvironment variations of catalytic active centers on the activity and selectivity of C  1  or C  2  reduction products in CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electroconversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by a Reconstructed Amino&#8208;functionalized Indium&#8208;Organic Framework Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient electrocatalysts is pivotal for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to realize the selective production of valuable chemicals and fuels. Herein, we report an amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;organic framework for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The immobilized surface amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO2 and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4% and a partial current density of 108 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;1.1 V vs. RHE in a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ~800 mA cm&#8722;2 at 3.4 V for the formate production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO2 electrocatalysis and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>A photoredox catalyst enabled para&#8208;selective trifluoromethylation of tert&#8208;butyl arylcarbamates.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group on an aromatic ring using a radical pathway has been extensively investigated. However, the direct highly  para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of a class of arenes has not been achieved. In this study, we report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled  para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using Langlois reagent. The preliminary mechanistic study revealed that the activated organic photocatalyst coordinated with the arylcarbamate led to  para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation. Ten&#8208;gram scale reaction performs well highlighting the synthetic importance of this new protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Diarylation/Annulation of Benzoic Acids: Facile Access to Multi&#8208;Aryl Spirobifluorenes as Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein disclosed is the first example of diarylation/annulation of benzoic acids via an iridium catalyst system. This protocol provides a step&#8208;economic and highly efficient pathway to 1&#8208;aryl, 1,3&#8208;diaryl, 1,7&#8208;diaryl, and 1,3,7&#8208;triaryl spirobifluorenes from readily available starting materials. The applications of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as pure hydrocarbon (PHC) hosts for red, green, and blue (RGB) phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) were explored. Due to high triplet energies, 1,3&#8208;diaryl spirobifluorenes exhibit the potential as the host material of blue PhOLEDs. 1,7&#8208;Diaryl spirobifluorene can serve as the host of green PhOLEDs. 1,3,7&#8208;Triaryl spirobifluorene is a high&#8208;performance host for red PhOLEDs, which exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 27.3%. This work not only exemplifies the great potential of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as PHC hosts, but also offers a new approach for the synthesis of these PHC hosts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified Catalytic Asymmetric (4+1) and (5+1) Annulation Strategy to Access Chiral Spirooxindole&#8208;Fused Oxacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unified catalytic asymmetric (N + 1) (N = 4, 5) annulation reaction of oxindoles with bifunctional peroxides has been achieved in the presence of a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. This general strategy utilizes peroxides as unique bielectrophilic four&#8208; or five&#8208;atom synthons to participate in the C&#8722;C and the subsequent umpolung C&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming reactions with one&#8208;carbon unit nucleophiles, thus providing a distinct method to access the valuable chiral spirooxindole&#8208;tetrahydrofurans and &#8208;tetrahydropyrans with good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of high enantioselectvity. The gram&#8208;scale syntheses and synthetic utility of the resultant products were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the druggability of conserved RNA regulatory elements in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains a positive single&#8208;stranded RNA genome of approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from  in&#8208;vivo  and  ex&#8208;vivo  structural probing experiments. These elements contain non&#8208;base&#8208;paired regions that potentially harbour ligand&#8208;binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR&#8208;based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different  1  H&#8208;based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA&#8208;element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru Nanoparticles Loaded Hollow Carbon Spheres as Nanoreactors for Hydrogenation of Levulinic Acid: Explicitly Recognizing the Void&#8208;Confinement Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a typical class of man&#8208;made nanoreactors, metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon nanostructures (MHC nanoreactors) exhibit competitive potentials in the heterogeneous catalysis due to their tailorable microenvironment effects, in which the void&#8208;confinement effect is one of the most fundamental functions in boosting the catalytic performance.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a typical class of man-made nanoreactors, metal-loaded hollow carbon nanostructures (MHC nanoreactors) exhibit competitive potentials in the heterogeneous catalysis due to their tailorable microenvironment effects, in which the void-confinement effect is one of the most fundamental functions in boosting the catalytic performance. Herein this paper, Ru-loaded hollow carbon spheres are employed as nanoreactors with a crucial biomass hydrogenation process, levulinic acid (LA) hydrogenation into &#947;-valerolactone, as the probe reaction to further recognize the forming mechanism of this pivotal effect.

         <title>Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene Ligands Enable Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Protoboration and Protosilylation of Terminal Alkynes: A Versatile Portal to Functionalized Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes represents a straightforward route to access alkenyl boronate and silane building blocks. In previously reported catalytic systems, high selectivity is achieved with a limited scope of substrates and/or reagents, with general solutions lacking. Herein, we describe a selective copper&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes that is facilitated by strongly donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands. Using this method, both alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted alkynes are coupled with a variety of boryl and silyl reagents with high &#945;&#8208;selectivity. The reaction is scalable, and the products are versatile intermediates that can participate in various downstream transformations. Preliminary mechanistic experiments shed light on the role of CAAC ligands in this process.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208;Alkyl Transposition in Allylic Alcohols Enabled by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method is described for the isomerization of acyclic allylic alcohols into &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones via 1,3&#8208;alkyl transposition. This reaction proceeds via light&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of the O&#8211;H bond in the allylic alcohol substrate, followed by C&#8211;C&#160;  b &#8208;scission&#160;  of the resulting alkoxy radical. The transient alkyl radical and enone acceptor generated in the scission event subsequently recombine via radical conjugate addition to deliver&#160;  &#946;  &#8208;functionalized ketone products. A variety of allylic alcohol substrates bearing alkyl and acyl migratory groups were successfully accommodated. Insights from mechanistic studies led to a modified reaction protocol that improves reaction performance for challenging substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly ActivePdO/Mn3O4/CeO2&#160; Nanocomposites Supported on One Dimensional Halloysite Nanotubes for Photoassisted Thermal Catalytic Methane Combustion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have successfully triggered the aqueous auto&#8208;redox reactions between reductive Ce(OH)  3  and oxidative MnO  4  &#8208;  /Pd  2+  ions to form PdO/Mn  3  O  4  /CeO  2  (PMC) nanocomposites. PMC could spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into compact encapsulation on the surface of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) to form the final one dimentional HNTs supported PMCs (HPMC). It is identified that there exists strong synergistic effects among the components of PdO, Mn  3  O  4  , and CeO  2  , and hence HPMC could show excellent performance on photoassisted thermal catalytic CH  4  combustion that its light&#8208;off temperature was sharply reduced to 180  o  C under visible light irradiation. Based on detailed studies, it is found that the catalytic reaction process well follows the classic MVK mechanism, and adsorption/activation of O  2  into active oxygen species (O*) should be the rate&#8208;determining step for CH  4  conversion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>HFIP was employed as an additive for the generation of 3&#8208;(chloromethylene)oxindoles via the chloroacylation of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides. This reaction avoids the use of a metal catalyst and accesses products in high yields and stereoselectivities. Additionally, this reaction is scalable, and proved amenable to a series of product derivatizations, including the synthesis of nintedanib. The reactivity of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with HFIP was harnessed towards the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Poly&#8208;oxalate Electrolytes Stabilizing both Anode and Cathode Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li/NMC811 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relatively narrow electrochemical steady window and low ionic conductivity are two critical challenges for Li+ conducting solid&#8208;polymer&#8208;electrolytes(SPE). Here, a family of poly&#8208;oxalate(POE) structures were prepared as SPE; among them, the odd&#8208;carbon&#8208;diols&#160;composed POEs show higher ionic conductivity than even&#8208;carbon&#8208;diols composed POEs, and the propanediol&#8208;composed POE(C5&#8208;POE) owns the highest Li+ conductivity. The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) electrons of POE were found located on the terminal units. Using trifluoroacetate as the terminating unit(POE&#8208;F), not only does the HOMO become more negative, but also the HOMO electrons shift to the middle oxalate units, improving the antioxidative capability. Furthermore, the interfacial compatibility across Li&#8208;metal/POE&#8208;F is also improved by the generation of LiF based solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interlayer(SEI). With the trifluoroacetate&#8208;terminated C5&#8208;POE(C5&#8208;POE&#8208;F) as electrolyte and Li+&#8208;conducting binder in cathode, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2(NMC811) cells showed significantly improved stability than the counterpart with poly&#8208;ether, providing a promising candidate for the forthcoming all&#8208;solid&#8208;state high voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries. Besides, three single crystal structures of Li&#8208;salts and oxalate in different ratios were obtained, bringing actual reference models for the future related simulations.</dc:description>

In this study, we demonstrate that enamine&#8208;based organic electron donors (OEDs) constitute the first systems able to initiate either free radical or anionic polymerization under simple, mild and safe conditions. While direct electron&#8208;transfer reduction of monomers by OEDs results in the initiation of anionic chain&#8208;growth polymerization, introduction of a competing oxidant with a higher reduction potential than the monomer switches the former anionic propagation to a clean radical propagation process. The benefit of this dual&#8208;mode activator is highlighted in the synthesis of an interpenetrating polymer network through simultaneous initiation of radical and anionic propagation processes</dc:description>

         <title>Highs and Lows of Bond Lengths: Is There Any Limit?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonds cannot be compressed or elongated at will. Two bond&#8208;length keepers watch for the stability of chemical bonds by imposing limits that cannot be exceeded. At short distances, the hard&#8208;sphere boundary prevents the interaction from becoming positive. At long distances, the spinodal condition prevents the bond force constant to be negative. Both are intrinsic consequences of the bond length at equilibrium.







Abstract
Two distinct points on the potential energy curve (PEC) of a pairwise interaction, the zero&#8208;energy crossing point and the point where the stretching force constant vanishes, allow us to anticipate the range of possible distances between two atoms in diatomic, molecular moieties and crystalline systems. We show that these bond&#8208;stability boundaries are unambiguously defined and correlate with topological descriptors of electron&#8208;density&#8208;based scalar fields, and can be calculated using generic PECs. Chemical databases and quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations are used to analyze a full set of diatomic bonds of atoms from the s&#8208;p main block. Emphasis is placed on the effect of substituents in C&#8722;C covalent bonds, concluding that distances shorter than 1.14&#8197;&#197; or longer than 2.0&#8197;&#197; are unlikely to be achieved, in agreement with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;pressure data and transition&#8208;state distances, respectively. Presumed exceptions are used to place our model in the correct framework and to formulate a conjecture for chained interactions, which offers an explanation for the multimodal histogram of O&#8722;H distances reported for hundreds of chemical systems.

         <title>Biphasic Electrolyte Inhibiting the Shuttle Effect of Redox Molecules in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic electrolyte containing solvents with differing polarities, as well as lithium salts, was used to inhibit the shuttle effect of redox molecules. The cycling stability of lithium rechargeable batteries was substantially improved.







Abstract
Redox molecules (RMs) as electron carriers have been widely used in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices (ESDs), such as lithium redox flow batteries and lithium&#8208;O2 batteries. Unfortunately, migration of RMs to the lithium (Li) anode leads to side reactions, resulting in reduced coulombic efficiency and early cell death. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study utilizes a biphasic organic electrolyte to resolve this issue, in which nonafluoro&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrahydrohexyl&#8208;trimethoxysilane (NFTOS) and ether (or sulfone) with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) can be separated to form the immiscible anolyte and catholyte. RMs are extracted to the catholyte due to the enormous solubility coefficients in the biphasic electrolytes with high and low polarity, resulting in inhibition of the shuttle effect. When coupled with a lithium anode, the Li&#8208;Li symmetric, Li redox flow and Li&#8208;O2 batteries can achieve considerably prolonged cycle life with biphasic electrolytes. This concept provides a promising strategy to suppress the shuttle effect of RMs in ESDs.

         <title>Gausemycins&#8197;A,B: Cyclic Lipoglycopeptides from Streptomyces sp.**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by actinobacteria and named gausemycins showed pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Gausemycins have a unique peptide core that includes 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb), chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), O&#8208;arabinosylated tyrosine, and N&#948;&#8208;acylated ornithine residues (see structure). Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences to known antibiotics.







Abstract
We report a novel family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by Streptomyces sp. INA&#8208;Ac&#8208;5812. Two major components of the mixture, named gausemycins&#8197;A and B, were isolated, and their structures were elucidated. The compounds are cyclic peptides with a unique peptide core and several remarkable structural features, including unusual positions of d&#8208;amino acids, lack of the Ca2+&#8208;binding Asp&#8208;X&#8208;Asp&#8208;Gly (DXDG) motif, tyrosine glycosylation with arabinose, presence of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb) and chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), and N&#8208;acylation of the ornithine side chain. Gausemycins have pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences compared to known glyco&#8208; and lipopeptides. Gausemycins exhibit only slight Ca2+&#8208;dependence of activity and induce no pore formation at low concentrations. Moreover, there is no detectable accumulation of cell wall biosynthesis precursors under treatment with gausemycins.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (APEDA) reaction was developed for the asymmetric total synthesis of the aryltetralin cyclic ether lignans aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E (see scheme) and enabled revision of the absolute configuration of these natural products. The strategy was also used to synthesize the aryldihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8722;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidin&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin and to build a small library of lignans (27 members).







Abstract
An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction between electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactones was developed to directly construct the basic tricyclic core of aryltetralin lactone lignans. This methodology enabled the first asymmetric total synthesis of aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E and revision of the absolute configuration of these natural lignans. The strategy was also used to prepare the naturally occurring aryldihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8722;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidin&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin in four and six steps, as well as 27 natural&#8208;product&#8208;like molecules containing a C8&#8242; quaternary center. We believe that the synthetic aglacins and small&#8208;molecule library provide new opportunities to carry out the SAR studies of the podophyllotoxin family of natural products.

         <title>3D&#8208;Positioning of Nanoparticles in High&#8208;Curvature Block Copolymer Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By directly linking nanoparticles to block copolymers, defined three&#8208;dimensional nanoparticle assemblies can be realized within domain unit cells. The block length ratio is the most important parameter determining the lattice type. Volume fractions of domains with large positive curvature of only one percent are already sufficient to destabilize lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces.







Abstract
The defined assembly of nanoparticles in polymer matrices is an important precondition for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Here we demonstrate that a defined three&#8208;dimensional nanoparticle assembly within the unit cells can be realized by directly linking the nanoparticles to block copolymers. We show that for a range of nearly symmetric to unsymmetric block copolymers there are only two formed structures, a hexagonal lattice of P6/mmm&#8208;symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in 1D&#8208;arrays within the cylindrical domains, and a cubic lattice of Im3m&#8208;symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in the octahedral voids of a BCC&#8208;lattice, corresponding to the structure of ferrite steel. We observe the block length ratio and thus the interfacial curvature to be the most important parameter determining the lattice type. This is rationalized in terms of minimal chain extension such that domain topologies with large positive curvature are highly preferred. Already volume fractions of only one percent are sufficient to destabilize a lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces. The study thus demonstrates how nanoparticles can be located on well&#8208;defined positions in three&#8208;dimensional unit cells of block copolymer nanocomposites. This opens the way to functional 3D&#8208;nanocomposites where the nanoparticles need to be located on defined matrix positions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defined assembly of nanoparticles in polymer matrices is an important precondition for next-generation functional materials. Here we demonstrate that a defined three-dimensional nanoparticle assembly within the unit cells can be realized by directly linking the nanoparticles to block copolymers. We show that for a range of nearly symmetric to unsymmetric block copolymers there are only two formed structures, a hexagonal lattice of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;6/&lt;i&gt;mmm&lt;/i&gt;-symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in 1D-arrays within the cylindrical domains, and a cubic lattice of Im3m-symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in the octahedral voids of a BCC-lattice, corresponding to the structure of ferrite steel. We observe the block length ratio and thus the interfacial curvature to be the most important parameter determining the lattice type. This is rationalized in terms of minimal chain extension such that domain topologies with large positive curvature are highly preferred. Already volume fractions of only one percent are sufficient to destabilize a lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces. The study thus demonstrates how nanoparticles can be located on well-defined positions in three-dimensional unit cells of block copolymer nanocomposites. This opens the way to functional 3D-nanocomposites where the nanoparticles need to be located on defined matrix positions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Colorimetric Metal&#8208;Free Detection of Carbon Monoxide: Reversible CO&#8197;Uptake by a BNB Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridan&#8208;derived receptors featuring an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor functionalized cavity offer a metal&#8208;free approach for binding carbon monoxide. Reversibility can be tuned through borane Lewis acidity and the binding event signalled colorimetrically.







Abstract
We report two BNB&#8208;type frustrated Lewis pairs which feature an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor functionalized cavity, and which differ in the nature of the B&#8208;bound fluoroaryl group (C6F5 vs. C6H3(CF3)2&#8208;3,5, Arf). These receptor systems are capable of capturing gaseous CO, and in the case of the &#8208;BArf2 system this can be shown to occur in reversible fashion at/above room temperature. For both systems, the binding event is accompanied by migration of one of the aryl substituents to the electrophilic carbon of the CO guest. Experiments utilizing an additional equivalent of PtBu3 allow the initially formed (non&#8208;migrated) CO adduct to be identified and trapped (via demethylation), while also establishing the reversibility of the B&#8208;to&#8208;C migration process. When partnered with the slightly less Lewis acidic &#8208;BArf2 substituent, this reversibility allows for release of the captured carbon monoxide in the temperature range 40&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, and the possibility for CO sensing, making use of the associated colourless to orange/red colour change.

         <title>Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of designing a crosslink of superposed fast and slow dynamics, we show the quantitative control of the association/dissociation rate constants of this crosslink over 5 orders of magnitude. With this crosslink, we achieved precise control over viscoelasticity and mechanical response of polymer networks.







Abstract
Depending on the dynamics of the crosslinks, polymer networks can have distinct bulk mechanical behaviors, from viscous liquids to tough solids. Here, by means of designing a crosslink with variable molecular dynamics, we show the control of viscoelasticity of polymer networks in a broad range quantitatively. The hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline@cucurbit[7]uril (HIQ@CB[7]) crosslink exhibits in a combination of protonated and deprotonated states of similar association affinity but distinct molecular dynamics. The molecular property of this crosslink is contributed by linear combination of the parameters at the two states, which is precisely tuned by pH. Using this crosslink, we achieve the quantitative control of viscoelasticity of quasi&#8208;ideal networks in 5 orders of magnitude, and we show the reversible control of mechanical response, such as stiffness, strength and extensibility, of tough random polymer networks. This strategy offers a way to tailor the mechanical properties of polymer networks at the molecular level and paves the way for engineering &#8220;smart&#8221; responsive materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Aminoalkylboronic Acids from Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Boryl Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the prevalence of boron&#8208;based therapeutics and inhibitors there is a dearth of methods to modulate oxidative stability of boronic acids. The introduction of fluorine atoms is known to increase oxidative stability of organic molecules, but fluoroalkyl groups connected to boron are unstable. Here we show that fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids are stable within a wide range of pH values, along with evidence of cyclic and linear conformers at basic pH.







Abstract
Our ongoing search for underdeveloped functional group combinations has brought to light &#945;&#8208;fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids, a new class of molecules featuring the B&#8208;CF linkage. These compounds can now be generated from secondary amines and &#945;&#8208;boryl aldehydes through electrophilic fluorination of boryl enamines or enamides. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids show no signs of degradation under ambient conditions. We present evidence for the involvement of chair&#8208;like motifs, favored over the acyclic forms by up to 1.7&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in water and held together by an amine&#8208;boronate hydrogen bond. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids are stable over a wide pH range and are characterized by a pKa of 3.4, which is the lowest of any alkylboronic acid.

         <title>Leakage&#8208;Proof Electrolyte Chemistry for a High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte is functionalized by Li+&#8208;conductive macromolecules of Li6PS5Cl&#8208;grafted poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate) with strong polar groups, which can interact readily with the aluminum&#8208;plastic packing layer through hydrogen bond to immobilize the electrolyte. And the moisture from ambient environment can catalyze a further polymerization of the macromolecules to seal the leaking points.







Abstract
Electrolyte leakage is a severe safety concern in lithium batteries. With highly volatile 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane as solvent, the leakage related hazards are more pronounced in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. To address this concern, a leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte is delicately designed through functionalizing the commercial electrolyte by Li6PS5Cl&#8208;grafted poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate), which can interact readily with the aluminum&#8208;plastic packing through hydrogen bond to immobilize the electrolyte. The moisture from ambient can also catalyze a further polymerization of the macromolecules to seal the leaking points and thereby to solve the leakage issue, endowing Li&#8208;S batteries superior safety even in an artificial cut pouch cell. With a bare S loading of 4.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the battery can deliver good endurance owing to the suppressed polysulfide shuttle by its polar groups. This work enlightens the design of leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte and makes a milestone for high performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Activity&#8208;Based E2&#8208;Ubiquitin Probes for the Structural Analysis of E3 Ligase&#8208;Catalyzed Transthiolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally new activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probe that closely resembles the native E2&#8764;Ub thioester has been developed and used for structural analysis of Cys&#8208;dependent E3 ligases&#8208;catalyzed transthiolation. This new probe is readily prepared in an expedient total chemical synthesis of atomically&#8208;tailored E2 enzyme variant using hydrazide&#8208;based native chemical ligation.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based E2 conjugating enzyme (E2)&#8208;ubiquitin (Ub) probes have recently emerged as effective tools for studying the molecular mechanism of E3 ligase (E3)&#8208;catalyzed ubiquitination. However, the preparation of existing activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probes depends on recombination technology and bioconjugation chemistry, limiting their structural diversity. Herein we describe an expedient total chemical synthesis of an E2 enzyme variant through a hydrazide&#8208;based native chemical ligation, which enabled the construction of a structurally new activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probe to covalently capture the catalytic site of Cys&#8208;dependent E3s. Chemical cross&#8208;linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) demonstrated the utility of this new probe in structural analysis of the intermediates formed during Nedd4 and Parkin&#8208;mediated transthiolation. This study exemplifies the utility of chemical protein synthesis for the development of protein probes for biological studies.

&lt;p&gt;A structurally new activity-based E2-Ub probe that closely resembles the native E2&#8764;Ub thioester has been developed and used for structural analysis of Cys-dependent E3 ligases-catalyzed transthiolation. This new probe is readily prepared in an expedient total chemical synthesis of atomically-tailored E2 enzyme variant using hydrazide-based native chemical ligation.

         <title>Merging Electron Transfer with 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement: Deoxygenative Arylation of Aromatic Amides with Arylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient protocol for deoxygenative C&#8722;C bond cross coupling of aromatic amides with air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable arylboronic esters is achieved, affording a series of biologically important diarylmethylamines in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The key to this success is proposed to be the merging of electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;induced activation of the amide by Sm/SmI2 with boron 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement.







Abstract
Amides are essentially inert carboxyl derivatives in many types of chemical transformations. In particular, deoxygenative C&#8722;C bond formation of amides to synthetically important amines is a long&#8208;standing challenge for synthetic chemists due to the inertness of the resonance&#8208;stabilized amide C=O bond. Herein, it is disclosed that by merging electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;induced activation with 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement, a wide range of aromatic amides react smoothly with arylboron reagents, affording a series of biologically relevant diarylmethylamines as deoxygenative C&#8722;C bond cross&#8208;coupling products. With its simplicity and versatility, this reaction shows great promise in the synthesis of amines from amides, which may open up new avenues in retrosynthetic planning and find widespread use in academia and industry.

         <title>Adjacent Atomic Pt Site Enables Single&#8208;Atom Iron with High Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation effect has been widely investigated to tune the electronic state of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts to enhance the activity of  oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the in&#8208;depth study of modulation effect is rarely reported for the isolated dual&#8208;atomic metal sites. Interestingly, guided by the first&#8208;principles simulations, we find that the catalytic activities of Fe&#8208;N 4  moiety can be enhanced by the adjacent Pt&#8208;N 4  moiety through the modulation effect&#65292; in which the Pt&#8208;N 4  acts as the modulator to tune the 3 d  electronic orbitals of Fe&#8208;N 4  active site and optimize ORR activity. Inspired by this principle, we design and synthesize the electrocatalyst that comprises isolated Fe&#8208;N 4  /Pt&#8208;N 4  moieties dispersed in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Fe&#8208;N 4  /Pt&#8208;N 4  @NC) and exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE and negligible activity degradation (&#8710;E 1/2  = 8 mV) after 10000 cycles in 0.1 M KOH. We also demonstrate that the modulation effect is not effective for optimizing the ORR performances of Co&#8208;N 4  /Pt&#8208;N 4  and Mn&#8208;N 4  /Pt&#8208;N 4  systems. These results have refreshed the knowledge of adjacent dual metal sites at the atomic&#8208;level and provided rational guidance for the design of efficient electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Transfer, Amplification, Storage and Complete Self&#8208;Recovery of Supramolecular Chirality in Achiral Polymer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chirality and its complete self&#8208;recovery ability are highly mystical in nature and biological systems, which remains a major challenge today. Herein, we firstly demonstrate that the partially cross&#8208;linked azobenzene (Azo) units can be employed as the potential chiral trigger to fully heal the destroyed helical superstructure in achiral nematic polymer system. Combining the self&#8208;assembly of Azo units and terminal hydroxyl in polymer side chains allows vapor&#8208;induced chiral nematic phase and covalent fixation of the superstructure via acetal reaction. The induced helical structure of Azo units can be stored by the inter&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking, even after the removal of chiral source. Most interestingly, the stored chiral information can trigger the perfect chiral self&#8208;recovery (CSR) behaviours after being destroyed by UV light, heat and solvent. The results pave a new way for producing novel chiroptical materials with reversible chirality from achiral sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Five Step Total Synthesis of Lythranidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise synthesis of the alkaloid lythranidine is reported. The strategy exploits the target&#8217;s local  C  2  symmetry by adopting a two directional synthetic approach, first in an acyclic environment, then in a cyclic system and finally in a bridged macrocyclic domain. The latter phase of the synthesis, which installs all four stereocenters, involves a thermodynamically controlled, twofold intermolecular/transannular aza&#8208;Michael addition and a twofold hydride reduction. The synthesis is one third of the length of the most step&#8208;economic previous approach, providing access to gram quantities of the natural product. The broad&#8208;spectrum nature of the synthesis is demonstrated through the preparation of three diastereomeric analogues of the natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Induced in situ Conductivity in Nickel&#8208;Based Oxyhydroxides: An Effective Descriptor for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

(left) The on&#8208;chip experimental apparatus that allows the concurrent CV and in situ conductivity (ETS) measurements. (right) The correlation between OER activity and in situ conductivity at large current density (50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Inset shows the double exchange interactions between high valency transition&#8208;metal ions with different d orbital occupancies in the lattice of OER active intermediates containing metal&#8208;oxyl bond (MIV&#8722;O.).







Abstract
Motivated by in silico predictions that Co, Rh, and Ir dopants would lead to low overpotentials to improve OER activity of Ni&#8208;based hydroxides, we report here an experimental confirmation on the altered OER activities for a series of metals (Mo, W, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir) doped into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. The in situ electrical conductivity for metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH correlates well with the trend in enhanced OER activities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to rationalize the in situ conductivity of the key intermediate states of metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during OER. The simultaneous increase of OER activity with intermediate conductivity was later rationalized by their intrinsic connections to the double exchange (DE) interaction between adjacent metal ions with various d orbital occupancies, serving as an indicator for the key metal&#8208;oxo radical character, and an effective descriptor for the mechanistic evaluation and theoretical guidance in design and screening of efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>Conformational Control of Chemical Reactivity for Surface&#8208;Confined Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO ligation to two different ruthenium porphyrins on the Ag(111) surface under vacuum was investigated experimentally and theoretically. The electronic and geometric changes upon ligation as well as the energetics of the process were elucidated. The surface adaptability of the porphyrin macrocycle conformation proves crucial for CO binding.







Abstract
We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real&#8208;space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing&#8208;wave measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature&#8208;programmed desorption the binding strength. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.

         <title>Molecularly Compensated Pre&#8208;Metallation Strategy for Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries and Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly compensated pre&#8208;metallation strategy triggered by Kolbe electrolysis has been successfully achieved for the construction of a high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors. Notably, the electrochemical oxidation potential of the metal carboxylate is modulated by the bonding energy of the oxygen&#8211;metal moiety, which is further manipulated by the electronic structure of the substituent and the hardness/softness of metal element.







Abstract
The use of a sacrificial cathode additive as a pre&#8208;metallation method could ensure adequate metal sources for advanced energy storage devices. However, this pre&#8208;metallation technique suffers from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre&#8208;metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of a metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of the oxygen&#8211;metal (O&#8211;M) moiety. The electron&#8208;donating effect of the substituent and the low charge density of the cation can dramatically weaken the O&#8211;M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre&#8208;sodiation feature for sodium&#8208;ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, remarkably delivering 70.6&#8201;% enhanced capacity retention in comparison to the additive&#8208;free system after 100&#8197;cycles. This methodology has been extended to construct a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion battery and a lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion capacitor.

         <title>Exploiting Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions for Efficient and Selective Catalysis with Chiral Molecular Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy by building cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in a confined cage cavity to drive efficient and selective catalysis was established. Only 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of easily made chiral cages enabled excellent conversions and up to 97&#8201;% ee in catalyzing a class of decarboxylate Mannich reactions, which was unrealized with conventional organocatalysts.







Abstract
Exploiting anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in catalyst design is a fascinating direction to develop new and fundamental catalysis. For the appealing yet flexible &#960;&#8208;face activation, can two or more &#960;&#8208;acidic surfaces be manipulated for cooperative activation to achieve efficient transformation and particularly selectivity control is highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate a supramolecular &#960;&#8208;catalysis strategy by establishing cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation in a confined electron&#8208;deficient cage cavity. The catalysts have a triazine based prism&#8208;like cage core and pendant chiral base sites. Only 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of cage catalyst efficiently catalyzed the decarboxylate Mannich reactions of sulfamate&#8208;headed cyclic aldimines and a series of malonic acid half thioesters in nearly quantitative yields and up to 97&#8201;% ee, enabling an unprecedent organocatalytic approach. The supramolecular &#960;&#8208;cavity is essential in harnessing cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for the efficient activation and excellent selectivity control.

         <title>The electronic metal&#8208;support interaction directing the design of single atomic site catalyst: achieving high efficiency towards hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is still of great difficulty to develop the non&#8208;platinum catalyst with high catalytic efficiency towards hydrogen evolution reaction via the strategies till now. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the new methods of catalyst designing. Here, we put forward the catalyst designed by the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), which is demonstrated to be a reliable strategy to find out the high&#8208;efficiency catalyst. We carried out the density functional theory calculation first to design the proper EMSI of the catalyst. We applied the model of M1&#8208;M2&#8208;X (X=C, N, O) during the calculation. Among the catalysts we chose, the EMSI of Rh1TiC, with the active sites of Rh1&#8208;Ti2C2, is found to be the most proper one for HER. The electrochemical experiment further demonstrated the feasibility of the EMSI strategy. The single atomic site catalyst of Rh1&#8208;TiC exhibits higher catalytic efficiency than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt/C. It achieves a small overpotential of 22 mV and 86 mV at the at the current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 and 100 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 in acid media, with a Tafel slope of 25 mV&#183;dec&#8208;1 and a mass activity of 54403.9 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;mgRh&#8208;1 (vs. 192.2 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;mgPt&#8208;1 of Pt/C). Besides, it also shows appealing advantage in energy saving compared with Pt/C (~20 % electricity consuming decrease at 2 kA&#183;m&#8208;2) Therefore, we believe that the strategy of regulating EMSI can act as a possible way for achieving the high catalytic efficiency on the next step of SACs.</dc:description>

Besides, it also shows appealing advantage in energy saving compared with Pt/C (~20 % electricity consuming decrease at 2 kA&#183;m-2) Therefore, we believe that the strategy of regulating EMSI can act as a possible way for achieving the high catalytic efficiency on the next step of SACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine backbone for highly efficient orange&#8208;red thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence with completely horizontal molecular orientation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simultaneous achievement of efficient photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and horizontal orientation of a transition dipole moment (TDM) in thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remain a significant challenge toward the realization of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, three TADF molecules, namely PQ1, PQ2, and PQ3, are composed of electron&#8208;accepting (A) tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) and electron&#8208;donating (D) phenoxazine (PXZ) units are designed and characterized. The combined effects of planar acceptor manipulation and high steric hindrance between D and A units endow high molecular rigidity that suppresses nonradiative decay of the excitons with improved PLQYs. Particularly, the well&#8208;aligned excited states involving a singlet and a triplet charge&#8208;transfer excited states and a localized excited triplet state in PQ3 enhances the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) with a short delay lifetime (&#964;d). Moreover, PQ3 exhibited a completely horizontal orientation of the TDM in the film, attributed to the expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated acceptor plane with 4&#8208;cyanophenyl groups incorporation. Consequently, the orange&#8208;red OLED based on PQ3 displays a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4 % with a well&#8208;suppressed EL efficiency roll&#8208;off. These results provide a feasible design strategy to construct efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters by concurrently attaining high EQE and horizontal TDM orientation through rational design engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically stabilized DNA barcodes for DNA&#8208;encoded chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded compound libraries are a widely used small molecule screening technology. One important aim in library design is the coverage of chemical space through structurally diverse molecules. Yet, the chemical reactivity of native DNA barcodes limits the toolbox of reactions for library design. Substituting the chemically vulnerable purines by 7&#8208;deazaadenine, which exhibits tautomerization stability similar to natural adenine with respect to the formation of stable Watson&#8208;Crick pairs, yielded ligation&#8208;competent, amplifiable, and readable DNA barcodes for encoded chemistry with enhanced stability against protic acid&#8208; and metal ion&#8208;promoted depurination. The barcode stability allowed for straightforward translation of 16&#160;exemplary reactions that included isocyanide multicomponent reactions, acid&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8208;Spengler and Biginelli reactions, and metal&#8208;promoted pyrazole syntheses on controlled pore glass&#8208;coupled barcodes for diverse DEL design. The Boc protective group of reaction products offered a convenient handle for encoded compound purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergetic Metal Defect and Surface Chemical Reconstruction into NiCo2S4/ZnS Heterojunction to Achieve Outstanding Electrocatalysis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect and interface engineering are recognized as effective strategies to regulate electronic structure and improve  activity  of  metal sulfide  . However, the practical application of sulfide is restricted by their low conductivity and rapid decline in activity derived from large volume fluctuation during electrocatalysis process. More importantly, the determination of exact active site of sulfide is complicated due to the inevitable electrochemical reconstruction. Herein, ZnS nanoparticles with  Zn defect  are anchored onto  the surface of NiCo  2  S  4  nanosheet to construct  NiCo  2  S  4  /ZnS  hybrids, which exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution performance with an ultralow overpotential of 140 mV. The anchoring of defective ZnS nanoparticles inhibit the volume expansion of NiCo  2  S  4  nanosheet during the cycling process.  Density&#8208;functional theory reveals that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defect can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve their intrinsic  activity  .</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2][B(OH)3]: Optimizing the Optical Anisotropy with Heteroanionic Units for Deep Ultraviolet Birefringent Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maximizing the optical anisotropy in birefringent materials has emerged as an efficient route for modulating the polarization&#8208;dependent light propagation. Currently, the generation of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) polarized light below 200 nm is essential but challenging due to the interdisciplinary significance and insufficiency of high&#8208;performing birefringent crystals. Herein, by introducing multiple heteroanionic units, the first sodium hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2][B(OH)3] has been characterized as a novel deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], optimally align to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with hydrogens, which results in an extremely large birefringence and bandgap. The well&#8208;ordered OH/F anions in [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3] were identified and confirmed by various approaches, and also the origin of large birefringence was theoretically discussed. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing hydrogen involved heteroanionic units to design crystals with large birefringence, and also expand the alternative system of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals with new hydroxyfluorooxoborates.</dc:description>

Therefore, there is a growing interest in selective methods for transforming abundant renewable feedstocks into monomers suitable for polymer production.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Time&#8208;resolved pump&#8211;probe (PP) spectroscopy has revolutionized mechanistic investigations in chemistry. In the present work, we introduce a new approach, fluorescence&#8208;detected pump&#8211;probe (F&#8208;PP) spectroscopy, that overcomes several limitations of traditional PP. F&#8208;PP suppresses excited&#8208;state absorption, provides background&#8208;free detection, removes artifacts resulting from pump&#8208;pulse scattering, from non&#8208;resonant solvent response or from coherent pulse overlap, and allows unique extraction of excited&#8208;state dynamics under certain conditions. Despite incoherent detection, time resolution of F&#8208;PP is given by the duration of the laser pulses, independent of the fluorescence lifetime. We describe the working principle of F&#8208;PP and provide its theoretical description. Then we illustrate specific features of F&#8208;PP by direct comparison with PP, theoretically and experimentally. For this purpose, we investigate, with both techniques, a molecular squaraine heterodimer, core&#8208;shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, and fluorescent protein mCherry. F&#8208;PP is broadly applicable to chemical systems in various environments and in different spectral regimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mobilization upon Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase transitions between different aggregate states are omnipresent in nature and technology. Conventionally, a crystalline phase melts upon heating as we use ice to cool a drink. Already in 1903, Gustav Tammann speculated about the opposite process, namely melting upon cooling. So far, evidence for such &#8220;inverse&#8221; transitions in real materials is rare and limited to few systems or extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate an inverse phase transition for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Molybdenum tetraacetate on copper (111) forms an ordered structure at room temperature, which dissolves upon cooling. This transition is mediated by molecules becoming mobile, i.e., by mobilization upon cooling. This unexpected phenomenon is ascribed to the larger number of internal degrees of freedom in the ordered phase compared to the mobile phase at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Loss Management by Molecularly Manipulating Dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) towards 16.93&#8201;% CsPbI2Br Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrical loss management strategy by using SMe&#8208;TATPyr molecule manipulating dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been developed and employed to fabricate efficient and thermally stable CsPbI2Br solar cells. The P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr presents optimized molecular orientation, favorable energy level alignment and effective defect passivation. Based on P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTLs, the fabricated devices yield a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93&#8201;% for CsPbI2Br solar cells with dopant&#8208;free HTLs.







Abstract
Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites offer a pathway towards thermally stable photovoltaics. However, moisture&#8208;induced phase degradation restricts the application of hole transport layers (HTLs) with hygroscopic dopants. Dopant&#8208;free HTLs fail to realize efficient photovoltaics due to severe electrical loss. Herein, we developed an electrical loss management strategy by manipulating poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) with a small molecule, i.e., SMe&#8208;TATPyr. The developed P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTL shows a three&#8208;time increase of carrier mobility owing to breaking the long&#8208;range ordering of &#8220;edge&#8208;on&#8221; P3HT and inducing the formation of &#8220;face&#8208;on&#8221; clusters, over 50&#8201;% decrease of the perovskite surface defect density, and a reduced voltage loss at the perovskite/HTL interface because of favorable energy level alignment. The CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93&#8201;% for dopant&#8208;free HTL, and superior moisture and thermal stability by maintaining 96&#8201;% efficiency at low&#8208;humidity condition (10&#8211;25&#8201;% R. H.) for 1500&#8197;hours and over 95&#8201;% efficiency after annealing at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1000&#8197;hours.

&lt;p&gt;Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites offer a pathway towards thermally stable photovoltaics. However, moisture-induced phase degradation restricts the application of hole transport layers (HTLs) with hygroscopic dopants. Dopant-free HTLs fail to realize efficient photovoltaics due to severe electrical loss. Herein, we developed an electrical loss management strategy by manipulating poly(3-hexylthiophene) with a small molecule, i.e., SMe-TATPyr. The developed P3HT/SMe-TATPyr HTL shows a three-time increase of carrier mobility owing to breaking the long-range ordering of &#8220;edge-on&#8221; P3HT and inducing the formation of &#8220;face-on&#8221; clusters, over 50&#8201;% decrease of the perovskite surface defect density, and a reduced voltage loss at the perovskite/HTL interface because of favorable energy level alignment. The CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record-high efficiency of 16.93&#8201;% for dopant-free HTL, and superior moisture and thermal stability by maintaining 96&#8201;% efficiency at low-humidity condition (10&#8211;25&#8201;% R.

         <title>Development of Continuous Flow Systems to Access Secondary Amines Through Previously Incompatible Biocatalytic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compartmentalised flow reactors allow biocatalytic cascades that would be impossible using standard methods, as described by Sebastian&#8197;C. Cosgrove, Sabine&#8197;L. Flitsch et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103805). Carbonyl intermediates were continuously generated via biocatalytic oxidation, then converted to different amine products using immobilised aminating enzymes. The use of flow equipment allowed exquisite control of the paths and enabled a range of new biocatalytic cascades to be constructed, paving the way for fully automated continuous biocatalytic cascades.

Mg&#8208;doped Li with about 5&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Mg (Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption&#8208;energy of Li from density functional theory calculations. Experimental tests demonstrate that Li&#8208;Mg5 exhibits superior cycling stability to pure Li and Li&#8208;Mg10 anodes in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage, leading to dense and less&#8208;corrosive Li deposition thus validating the simulation results.







Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;magnesium (Mg) alloy with limited Mg amount, which can also be called Mg&#8208;doped Li (Li&#8208;Mg), has been considered as a potential alternative anode for high energy density rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, the optimum doping&#8208;content of Mg in Li&#8208;Mg anode and the mechanism of the improved performance are not well understood. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the effect of Mg amount in Li&#8208;Mg anode. The Li&#8208;Mg with about 5&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Mg (abbreviated as Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption energy of Li, thus all the surface area can be &#8220;controlled&#8221; by Mg atoms, leading to the smooth and continuous deposition of Li on the surface around the Mg center. A localized high concentration electrolyte enables Li&#8208;Mg5 to exhibit the best cycling stability in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage, which is approaching the demand of practical application. This electrolyte also helps generate an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which leads to smooth, compact and less corrosion layer on the Li&#8208;Mg5 surface. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results prove that Li&#8208;Mg5 has optimum Mg content and gives best battery cycling performance.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning of Chiral Microenvironments within Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates for Enhanced Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a new family of triple&#8208;stranded helicates with fascinating chiral characteristics from axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;type ligands are reported. The fine&#8208;tuning of chiral microenvironments within the well&#8208;defined complexes has enabled outstanding chiral discrimination properties, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35).







Abstract
Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of chiral helicates. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded ZnII2L3 complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and ZnII. Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global supramolecular chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates that their chiral discrimination are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Synergistically Enhanced Hyperpolarizability: Chiral Coordination Polymers with Nonpolar Structures Exhibiting Unusually Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically synthesized new noncentrosymmetric nonpolar chiral coordination polymers exhibit unusually strong second&#8208;harmonic generation efficiencies attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and increased hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8211;acceptor system originating from the robust hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers. Details can be found in the Communication by Joonhyuk Kee and Kang&#8197;Min Ok (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106812).

         <title>Sydnone methides &#8211; a forgotten class of mesoionic compounds for the generation of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sydnone methides are described from which only one single example has been mentioned in the literature so far. Their deprotonation gave anions which can be formulated as &#960;&#8208;electron rich anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Sulfur and selenium adducts were stabilized as their methyl ethers, and mercury, gold as well as rhodium complexes of the sydnone methide carbenes were prepared. Sydnone methide anions also undergo C&#8208;C coupling reactions with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;iodobenzene under Pd(PPh  3  )  4  and CuBr catalysis.  77  Se NMR resonance frequencies and  1  J  C4&#8208;Se  as well as  1  J  C4&#8208;H  coupling constants have been determined to gain knowledge about the electronic properties of the anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. The carbene carbon atom of the sydnone methide anion  3j  resonates at &#948; = 155.2 ppm in  13  C NMR spectroscopy at &#8208;40&#176;C which is extremely shifted upfield in comparison to classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Engineering of Cesium Manganese Bromides Nanocrystals with Color&#8208;Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For display applications, it is highly desirable to obtain tunable red/green/blue emission. However, lead&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) generally exhibit broadband emission with poor color purity. Herein, we develop a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides NCs and we can achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity in these NCs. Such phase transition can be triggered by isopropanol: from one dimensional (1D) CsMnBr 3  NCs (red&#8208;color emission) to zero dimensional (0D) Cs 3  MnBr 5  NCs (green&#8208;color emission). Furthermore, in a humid environment both 1D CsMnBr 3  NCs and 0D Cs 3  MnBr 5  NCs can be transformed into 0D Cs 2  MnBr 4  &#183;2H 2  O NCs (blue&#8208;color emission). Cs 2  MnBr 4  &#183;2H 2  O NCs could inversely transform into the mixture of CsMnBr 3  and Cs 3  MnBr 5  phase during the thermal annealing dehydration step. Our work highlights the tunable optical properties in single component NCs via phase engineering and provides a new avenue for future endeavors in light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Difunctionalization Triggered by a Stabilized Allenyl Radical: Elusively Concomitant Installation of Two Unsaturated C&#8208;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;mediated difunctionalization of alkenes provides a promising approach to introduce one alkenyl or alkynyl group to target compounds. However, simultaneous installation of two unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds via alkene difunctionalization remains elusive, attributable to the high instability and transient lifetimes of alkenyl and alkynyl radicals. Herein, we report the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes for the first time, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene. A portfolio of strategically designed, easily accessible dual&#8208;function reagents are applied to a radical docking&#8208;migration cascade. The protocol has broad substrate scope and efficiently increases the degree of unsaturation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridge Functionalisation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;Escaping from flatland&#8221;, by increasing the saturation level and three&#8208;dimensionality of drug&#8208;like compounds, can enhance their potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and tert&#8208;butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well&#8208;documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This review aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Metabolites Using an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive Polymer Dot and a Metabolite&#8208;specific Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medical biosensors for real&#8208;time measurement of patient metabolite levels are needed to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases such as diabetes, phenylketonuria, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Over 100 medically relevant metabolites can be quantified by measuring the stoichiometric formation of NAD(P)H in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here we introduce an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point&#8208;of&#8208;care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627 nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458 nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically&#8212;based on the ratio of blue&#8208;to&#8208;red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera&#8212;with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease&#8208;related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate), and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphore imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use. This biosensor has broad potential utility as any metabolite that is enzymatically oxidized by NAD  +  or NADP  +  can be detected with this system.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Protoboration of CF3&#8208;Containing 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective protoboration of CF  3  &#8208;containing conjugated diene with proton source and B  2  pin  2&#160;  has been developed. This chemistry could suppress the well&#8208;known defluorination and provide borated reagents with an intact CF  3  &#8208;group. Further studies indicated that the functional group tolerance of this chemistry is very well, and the products could be used as versatile precursors for different types of transformations. Importantly, using chiral diphosphine ligand, we have developed the first example for using such starting material to synthesis allylic boron&#8208;reagents which bearing a CF  3  &#8208;containing chiral center. Notably, the reaction mechanism was intensively studied by DFT calculation, which could reveal the reason that defluorination was inhibited.</dc:description>

         <title>Twofold C&#8208;H Activation&#8208;Based Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8208;H Arylation Using Diarylacetylenes as Rare Arylating Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;H bond activation has been established as an attractive strategy to access axially chiral biaryls, and the most straightforward method is direct C&#8208;H arylation of arenes. However, the arylating source has been limited to several classes of reactive and bulky reagents. Reported herein is rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of diarylphosphinic amides and diarylacetylenes for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of biaryls with both central and axial chirality. This twofold C&#8208;H activation reaction stays contrast to the previously explored Miura&#8208;Satoh type 1:2 coupling of arenes and alkynes in terms of chemoselectivity and proceeded under mild conditions with the alkyne acting as a rare arylating reagent. Both C&#8208;H activation events are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control, with the 2nd C&#8208;H activation being diastereo&#8208;determining in a remote fashion. Analysis of the stereochemistries of the major and side products suggests moderate enantioselectivity of the initial C&#8208;H activation&#8208;desymmetrization process. However, the minor (R) rhodium vinyl intermediate is consumed more readily in undesired protonolysis, eventually resulting in high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the major product.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Resolution View of the Coordination Environment in a Paramagnetic Metalloprotein from its Magnetic Properties</title>

A close look from a distance: Pseudocontact shifts depend on the magnetic susceptibility of the metal center, which in turn depends on the coordination geometry. We exploit these dependencies to obtain a detailed view of metal coordination in a metalloprotein.







Abstract
Metalloproteins constitute a significant fraction of the proteome of all organisms and their characterization is critical for both basic sciences and biomedical applications. A large portion of metalloproteins bind paramagnetic metal ions, and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy has been widely used in their structural characterization. However, the signals of nuclei in the immediate vicinity of the metal center are often broadened beyond detection. In this work, we show that it is possible to determine the coordination environment of the paramagnetic metal in the protein at a resolution inaccessible to other techniques. Taking the structure of a diamagnetic analogue as a starting point, a geometry optimization is carried out by fitting the pseudocontact shifts obtained from first principles quantum chemical calculations to the experimental ones.

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15028-15035, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid electrolyte design inherits the merits of both aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, showing promising features for next&#8208;generation redox flow batteries: non&#8208;flammability, wide potential window, and wide operational temperature range. This work presents a promising electrolyte chemistry towards safe and wide&#8208;temperature large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5&#8197;V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9&#8201;%, showing long cycling stability over 800&#8197;cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C for 150&#8197;cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.

         <title>Synthesis and Multiple Subsequent Reactivity of Anionic cyclo&#8208;E3 Ligand Complexes (E=P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15101-15108, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of an intact cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand (E=P, As) from the nickel complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni(&#951;3&#8208;E3)] to the anionic cobalt complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; was achieved, which was afterwards quenched with main group electrophiles such as chlorophosphanes (R2PCl). That way, the E3 cycle can be expanded to a substituted four&#8208;membered ring, which undergoes further rearrangement processes by ring contractions to a cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit.







Abstract
A synthetic pathway for the synthesis of novel anionic sandwich complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand as an end deck was developed giving [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, E=P ([5]), As ([6])) in good yields suitable for further reactivity studies. In the reaction with the chlorophosphanes R2PCl (R=Ph, Cy, tBu), neutral complexes with a disubstituted cyclo&#8208;E3P (E=P, As) ligand in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (7&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (9&#8201;a&#8211;c)) were obtained. These compounds can be partially or completely converted into complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;2:&#951;1&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (8&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (10&#8201;a&#8211;c)). Additionally, the insertion of the chlorosilylene [LSiCl] (L=(tBuN)2CPh) into the cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand of [5] and [6] was achieved and the novel heteroatomic complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3SiL)] (E=P (11), As (12)) could be isolated. The reaction pathway was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <dc:description>
An enantiodivergent organocatalytic kinetic resolution method has been developed, which is inspired by the Atherton&#8211;Todd (A&#8208;T) reaction. A range of R&#8208; and S&#8208;enantiomers of atropisomeric biaryls were obtained in high yields with excellent selectivity factors. The bifunctional phosphonium halide catalysts differentiate between the in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated P&#8208;species in the A&#8208;T reaction system, which results in efficient enantiodivergent O&#8208;phosphorylation reactions.







Abstract
A highly enantiodivergent organocatalytic method is disclosed for the synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls via kinetic resolution inspired by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed Atherton&#8211;Todd (A&#8208;T) reaction. This flexible approach led to both R&#8208; and S&#8208;enantiomers by fine&#8208;tuning of bifunctional phosphonium with excellent selectivity factors (s) of up to 1057 and 525, respectively. The potential of newly synthesized O&#8208;phosphorylated biaryl diols was illustrated by the synthesis of axially chiral organophosphorus compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the bifunctional phosphonium halide catalyst differentiates between the in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated P&#8208;species in the A&#8208;T process, mainly involving phosphoryl chloride and phosphoric anhydride, thus leading to highly enantiodivergent O&#8208;phosphorylation reactions. Furthermore hydrogen bonding interactions between the catalysts and phosphorus molecules were crucial in asymmetric induction.

     alt="Enantiodivergent Kinetic Resolution of 1,1&#8242;-Biaryl-2,2&#8242;-Diols and Amino Alcohols by Dipeptide-Phosphonium Salt Catalysis Inspired by the Atherton&#8211;Todd Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enantiodivergent organocatalytic kinetic resolution method has been developed, which is inspired by the Atherton&#8211;Todd (A-T) reaction. A range of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-enantiomers of atropisomeric biaryls were obtained in high yields with excellent selectivity factors. The bifunctional phosphonium halide catalysts differentiate between the in-situ-generated &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-species in the A-T reaction system, which results in efficient enantiodivergent O-phosphorylation reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;

Multi&#8208;milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of the first example of a bowl&#8208;shaped nanographene with a pyrrolo&#8208;pyrrole core has been achieved via sequential, programmed, intramolecular direct arylations. This curved molecule possesses an inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology (a combination of fused pentagons and heptagons), small bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion barrier, high&#8208;lying HOMO, weak red&#8208;emission at 615&#8197;nm, and a small dipole moment.







Abstract
A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another has been prepared via a concise synthetic strategy encompassing the multicomponent tetraarylpyrrolopyrrole (TAPP) synthesis, the Scholl reaction, and intramolecular direct arylation. This synthesis represents the first case of programmed sequential intramolecular direct arylation reactions utilizing the different reactivity of C&#8211;Br and C&#8211;Cl bonds. The target compound contains two central pentagons confined between two adjacent heptagons&#8212;the inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology. The presence of both five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in the final structure is responsible for interesting properties such as a perpendicularly aligned dipole moment, absorption and fluorescence in the orange&#8208;red region, weak emission originating from the charge&#8208;transfer character of a low&#8208;energy absorption band, and a high lying HOMO. In the solid state slipped convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking dominates.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Uranyl Superoxide</title>

A novel uranyl superoxide compound reacts with carbon dioxide resulting in uranyl carbonate phases within six days of air exposure, directly linking uranyl superoxide to the carbonate corrosion products observed on the surface of spent nuclear fuel.







Abstract
The high radiation field associated with spent nuclear fuel (UIVO2) pellets produces an array of reactive radical species that impact the corrosion and formation of secondary alteration phases. Dioxygen radicals are important as radiolysis products, but the interaction between these reactive oxygen species and UVIO22+ and its effects on the resultant alteration phases is unclear. We report the first example of a UVI superoxide compound and explore its reactivity in the environments relevant to the storage of spent nuclear fuel. We utilized X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman scattering techniques to demonstrate that the uranyl superoxide reacts with CO2 in air to afford a mixed uranyl peroxide/carbonate within 3&#8197;days, both in solution and under atmospheric conditions. An additional transformation occurs over the course of 3&#8197;months to form a potassium UVI carbonate (grimselite), which also occurs as an alteration product on Chernobyl corium. Our results demonstrate the presence and significance of the superoxide anion in the alteration of spent nuclear fuel and indicate the impact of uranyl superoxide chemistry on high prevalence of carbonate in the secondary phases of spent nuclear fuel.

         <title>Evidence of Mars&#8208;Van&#8208;Krevelen Mechanism in the Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution on Ni&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>

Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry using a hanging droplet cell confirmed the occurrence of Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both Ni(OH)2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. This mechanism involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface and the electrolyte.







Abstract
Water oxidation is a crucial reaction for renewable energy conversion and storage. Among the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, NiFe based oxyhydroxides show the highest catalytic activity. However, the details of their OER mechanism are still unclear, due to the elusive nature of the OER intermediates. Here, using a novel differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) cell interface, we performed isotope&#8208;labelling experiments in 18O&#8208;labelled aqueous alkaline electrolyte on Ni(OH)2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. Our experiments confirm the occurrence of Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both catalysts to various degrees, which involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst and the electrolyte. The quantitative charge analysis suggests that the participating lattice oxygen atoms belong exclusively to the catalyst surface, confirming DFT computational hypotheses. Also, DEMS data suggest a fundamental correlation between the magnitude of the lattice oxygen mechanism and the faradaic efficiency of oxygen controlled by pseudocapacitive oxidative metal redox charges.

Metalloprotein properties can be tuned by changing the primary metal coordination sphere. Here amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases was used to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with a range of new amino acids. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &gt;200 mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate.







Abstract
Changing the primary metal coordination sphere is a powerful strategy for tuning metalloprotein properties. Here we used amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including two newly evolved enzymes, to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with N&#948;&#8208;methylhistidine, 5&#8208;thiazoylalanine, 4&#8208;thiazoylalanine and 3&#8208;(3&#8208;thienyl)alanine. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &gt;200&#8197;mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate. Variants with increased reduction potential proved superior for cyclopropanation and N&#8211;H insertion, whereas variants with reduced Eo values gave higher S&#8211;H insertion activity. Given the functional importance of histidine in many enzymes, these genetically encoded analogues could be valuable tools for probing mechanism and enabling new chemistries.

         <title>Efficient Intramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Fluorophores Based on Substituted Triphenylphosphine Donors</title>

Trivalent phosphorus is considered as new electron&#8208;donating species for intramolecular charge transfer fluorophores. The efficient triphenylphosphine&#8208;based emitters with excellent electrochemical stability and small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting afford potentials for luminescence&#8208;based applications and devices.







Abstract
Triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;based luminescent compounds are rarely investigated because of the low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we demonstrate that introducing steric hindrance groups to the TPP moiety and separating the orbitals involved in the transition can drastically suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay induced by structural distortion of TPP in the excited state. High PLQY up to 0.89 as well as thermally activated delayed fluorescence are observed from the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) molecules with substituted TPP donors (sTPPs) in doped films. The red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve comparable external quantum efficiencies to the control device containing a classical phosphorescent dye, revealing the great potential of the ICT emitters based on electrochemically stable sTPPs.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Dielectric Property and Energy Transfer on Charge Separation in Non&#8208;Fullerene&#8208;Based Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15054-15062, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of the higher dielectric property of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and corresponding photoactive films and the energy transfer from donor to acceptor on charge separation of selected non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, these results well interpret the high device performance with a tiny driving force, and the intrinsic physical working mechanism on non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is proposed.







Abstract
In non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, it is unclear how excitons efficiently dissociate into charge carriers under small driving force. Here, we developed a modified method to estimate dielectric constants of PM6 donor and non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Surprisingly, most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and blend films showed higher dielectric constants. Moreover, they exhibited larger dielectric constants differences at the optical frequency. These results are likely bound to reduced exciton binding energy and bimolecular recombination. Besides, the overlap between the emission spectrum of donor and absorption spectra of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors allowed the energy transfer from donor to acceptors. Hence, based on the synergistic effect of dielectric property and energy transfer resulting in efficient charge separation, our finding paves an alternative path to elucidate the physical working mechanism in non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Polarity&#8208;Sensitive Ratiometric Fluorescence Probe for Monitoring Changes in Lipid Droplets and Nucleus during Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15095-15100, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first lipid droplet (LD)/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted ratiometric fluorescence probe, CQPP, for monitoring polarity change was developed. CQPP offers ratiometric fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime imaging of LD polarity variations. Using nucleus imaging as a reference, CQPP was applied to report the increase in LD polarity and the homogenization of polarity between LDs and cytoplasm in the ferroptosis model.







Abstract
Ferroptosis regulates cell death through reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;associated lipid peroxide accumulation, which is expected to affect the structure and polarity of lipid droplets (LDs), but with no clear evidence. Herein, we report the first example of an LD/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted ratiometric fluorescent probe, CQPP, for monitoring polarity changes in the cellular microenvironment. Due to the donor&#8211;acceptor structure of CQPP, it offers ratiometric fluorescence emission and fluorescence lifetime signals that reflect polarity variations. Using nucleus imaging as a reference, CQPP was applied to report the increase in LD polarity and the homogenization of polarity between LDs and cytoplasm in the ferroptosis model. This LD/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe shows the great potential of using fluorescence imaging to study ferroptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;related diseases.

An end&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxodicobalt(III) complex 1 involving a non&#8208;heme ligand system, L1, supported on a Sn6O6 stannoxane core has been found to be a reactive electrophile that is capable of initiating hydrogen atom and oxygen atom transfer reactions. The electrophilicity of 1 is attributed to the constraints provided by the Sn6O6 core and represents a new domain for metal&#8722;peroxo reactivity.







Abstract
&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediates P are proposed as reactive intermediates in various biological oxidation reactions. In sMMO, P acts as an electrophile, and performs hydrogen atom and oxygen atom transfers to electron&#8208;rich substrates. In cyanobacterial ADO, however, P is postulated to react by nucleophilic attack on electrophilic carbon atoms. In biomimetic studies, the ability of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;bridged dimetal complexes of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu to act as nucleophiles that effect deformylation of aldehydes is documented. By performing reactivity and theoretical studies on an end&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxodicobalt(III) complex 1 involving a non&#8208;heme ligand system, L1, supported on a Sn6O6 stannoxane core, we now show that a peroxo&#8208;bridged dimetal complex can also be a reactive electrophile. The observed electrophilic chemistry, which is induced by the constraints provided by the Sn6O6 core, represents a new domain for metal&#8722;peroxide reactivity.

         <title>Origins of Endo Selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Cyclic Allene Dienophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14989-14997, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of the factors contributing to endo selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with strained cyclic allenes is reported. The contributions of a new type of secondary orbital interaction resulting from the twisted nature of the strained allene, and electrostatic effects, to endo selectivity are established.







Abstract
Strained cyclic allenes, first discovered in 1966 by Wittig and co&#8208;workers, have recently emerged as valuable synthetic building blocks. Previous experimental investigations, and computations reported here, demonstrate that the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of furans and pyrroles with 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene and oxa&#8208; and azaheterocyclic analogs proceed with endo selectivity. This endo selectivity gives the adduct with the allylic saturated carbon of the cyclic allene endo to the diene carbons. The selectivity is very general and useful in synthetic applications. Our computational study establishes the origins of this endo selectivity. We analyze the helical frontier molecular orbitals of strained cyclic allenes and show how secondary orbital and electrostatic effects influence stereoselectivity. The LUMO of carbon&#8208;3 of the allene (C&#8208;3 is not involved in primary orbital interactions) interacts in a stabilizing fashion with the HOMO of the diene in such a way that the carbon of the cyclic allene attached to C&#8208;1 favors the endo position in the transition state. The furan LUMO, allene HOMO interaction reinforces this preference. These mechanistic studies are expected to prompt the further use of long&#8208;avoided strained cyclic allenes in chemical synthesis.

Previous experimental investigations, and computations reported here, demonstrate that the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of furans and pyrroles with 1,2-cyclohexadiene and oxa- and azaheterocyclic analogs proceed with &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. This &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; selectivity gives the adduct with the allylic saturated carbon of the cyclic allene &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; to the diene carbons. The selectivity is very general and useful in synthetic applications. Our computational study establishes the origins of this &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. We analyze the helical frontier molecular orbitals of strained cyclic allenes and show how secondary orbital and electrostatic effects influence stereoselectivity. The LUMO of carbon-3 of the allene (C-3 is not involved in primary orbital interactions) interacts in a stabilizing fashion with the HOMO of the diene in such a way that the carbon of the cyclic allene attached to C-1 favors the &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; position in the transition state. The furan LUMO, allene HOMO interaction reinforces this preference. These mechanistic studies are expected to prompt the further use of long-avoided strained cyclic allenes in chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Single&#8208;Handed Double Helix and Spiral Platelet Formed by Racemate of Dissymmetric Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15080-15086, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of dissymmetric cage DC&#8208;1 forms an unusual supramolecular double helix, which is composed of six racemic pairs of DC&#8208;1 per turn, and exhibits a single&#8208;handed helical sense. These single&#8208;handed helices with frustrated packing further assembled into hexagonal crystals with screw dislocation, with symmetry&#8208;breaking at morphological level.







Abstract
Spontaneous deracemization has been used to separate homochiral domains from the racemic system. However, homochirality can only be referred to when the scales of these domains and systems are specified. To clarify this, we report self&#8208;assembly of racemates of dissymmetric cages DC&#8208;1 with a cone&#8208;shape propeller geometry, forming a centrosymmetric columnar crystalline phase (racemic at crystallographic level). Owing to their anisotropic geometry, the two enantiomers are packed in a frustrated fashion in this crystalline phase; single&#8208;handed double helices are observed (single&#8208;handedness at supramolecular level). The frustrated packing (layer continuity break&#8208;up) in turn facilitates screw dislocation during the crystal growth, forming left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed spiral platelets (symmetry&#8208;breaking at morphological level), although each platelet is composed of DC&#8208;1 racemates. The symmetry correlation between DC&#8208;1 molecules, the crystalline phase and spiral platelets, all exhibit C3 symmetry.

         <title>Supercharging Prions via Amyloid&#8208;Selective Lysine Acetylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15069-15079, June 25, 2021. </description>

Lead compounds were designed to &#8220;supercharge&#8221; misfolded forms of proteins linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (i.e., superoxide dismutase&#8208;1; &#945;&#8208;synuclein). Compounds increased the net negative charge of amyloid fibrils via lysine peracetylation, with minimal to no modification of various proteins in their native state. Supercharged fibrils exhibited weaker seeding activity in vitro and in organotypic spinal cord.







Abstract
Repulsive electrostatic forces between prion&#8208;like proteins are a barrier against aggregation. In neuropharmacology, however, a prion's net charge (Z) is not a targeted parameter. Compounds that selectively boost prion Z remain unreported. Here, we synthesized compounds that amplified the negative charge of misfolded superoxide dismutase&#8208;1 (SOD1) by acetylating lysine&#8208;NH3+ in amyloid&#8208;SOD1, without acetylating native&#8208;SOD1. Compounds resembled a &#8220;ball and chain&#8221; mace: a rigid amyloid&#8208;binding &#8220;handle&#8221; (benzothiazole, stilbene, or styrylpyridine); an aryl ester &#8220;ball&#8221;; and a triethylene glycol chain connecting ball to handle. At stoichiometric excess, compounds acetylated up to 9 of 11 lysine per misfolded subunit (&#916;Zfibril=&#8722;8100 per 103 subunits). Acetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 seeded aggregation more slowly than unacetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 in vitro and organotypic spinal cord (these effects were partially due to compound binding). Compounds exhibited reactivity with other amyloid and non&#8208;amyloid proteins (e.g., fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein was peracetylated; serum albumin was partially acetylated; carbonic anhydrase was largely unacetylated).

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzoin Acetate: A Macrocyclic Porous Molecular Crystal for CO2 Separations by Pressure Swing Adsorption**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14931-14937, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous molecular crystal assembled by the close packing of macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is used as an efficient adsorbent in pressure swing adsorption for CO2 capture. It exhibits excellent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance via both kinetic and thermodynamic effects.







Abstract
A porous molecular crystal (PMC) assembled by macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is an efficient adsorbent for CO2 separations. The 7.1&#215;7.1&#8197;&#197; square pore of PMC and its ester C=O groups play important roles in improving its affinity for CO2 molecules. The benzene walls of macrocycle engage in an apparent [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interaction with the molecule of CO2 at low pressure. In addition, the polar carbonyl groups pointing inward the square channels reduce the size of aperture to a 5.0&#215;5.0&#8197;&#197; square, which offers kinetic selectivity for CO2 capture. The PMC features water tolerance and high structural stability under vacuum and various gas adsorption conditions, which are rare among intrinsically porous organic molecules. Most importantly, the moderate adsorbate&#8208;adsorbent interaction allows the PMC to be readily regenerated, and therefore applied to pressure swing adsorption processes. The eluted N2 and CH4 are obtained with over 99.9&#8201;% and 99.8&#8201;% purity, respectively, and the separation performance is stable for 30&#8197;cycles. Coupled with its easy synthesis, cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is a promising adsorbent for CO2 separations from flue and natural gases.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Generation in Dark&#8208;Hypoxia by Catalytic Microenvironment&#8208;Tailored Nanoreactors for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactors (CMTNs) with a built&#8208;in ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent 1O2 sensor were fabricated for monitored chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Benefiting from the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and glutathione (GSH), the liposome&#8208;based CMTNs afford favorable pH for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protect MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation&#8208;triggered inactivation.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) has a potent anticancer effect, but photosensitized generation of 1O2 is inhibited by tumor hypoxia and limited light penetration depth. Despite the potential of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to circumvent these issues by exploration of 1O2&#8208;producing catalysts, engineering efficient CDT agents is still a formidable challenge since most catalysts require specific pH to function and become inactivated upon chelation by glutathione (GSH). Herein, we present a catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactor (CMTN), constructed by encapsulating MoO42&#8722; catalyst and alkaline sodium carbonate within liposomes, which offers a favorable pH condition for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protects MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation owing to the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and GSH. H2O2 and 1O2 can freely cross the liposomal membrane, allowing CMTN with a built&#8208;in NIR&#8208;II ratiometric fluorescent 1O2 sensor to achieve monitored tumor CDT.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed generation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and protects MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from GSH chelation owing to the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and GSH. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can freely cross the liposomal membrane, allowing CMTN with a built-in NIR-II ratiometric fluorescent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensor to achieve monitored tumor CDT.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>General, Divergent Platform for Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes with High Reactivity and Favorable Physiochemical Properties**

Hydrophilic trans&#8208;cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enones (TCOs) with favorable physicochemical properties for live cell or in&#8197;vivo experiments are especially hard to access. Readily accessible TCOs are now shown to undergo diastereoselective additions with a broad range of nucleophiles to give access to functionalized axial&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (a&#8208;TCO), a family of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes with high reactivity and improved physiochemical properties.







Abstract
trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes (TCOs) are essential partners in the fastest known bioorthogonal reactions, but current synthetic methods are limited by poor diastereoselectivity. Especially hard to access are hydrophilic TCOs with favorable physicochemical properties for live cell or in&#8197;vivo experiments. Described is a new class of TCOs, &#8220;a&#8208;TCOs&#8221;, prepared in high yield by stereocontrolled 1,2&#8208;additions of nucleophiles to trans&#8208;cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enone, which itself was prepared on a large scale in two steps from 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Computational transition&#8208;state models rationalize the diastereoselectivity of 1,2&#8208;additions to deliver a&#8208;TCO products, which were also shown to be more reactive than standard TCOs and less hydrophobic than even a trans&#8208;oxocene analogue. Illustrating the favorable physicochemical properties of a&#8208;TCOs, a fluorescent TAMRA derivative in live HeLa cells was shown to be cell&#8208;permeable through intracellular Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry and to wash out more rapidly than other TCOs.

         <title>Thermosensitive Vesicles from Chemically Encoded Lipid&#8208;Grafted Elastin&#8208;like Polypeptides</title>

Temperature&#8208;sensitive lipo&#8208;proteinosomes were engineered by grafting lipids onto temperature&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs). Maintained at 37&#8201;&#176;C, folded ELP loops on the internal/external surface of the biohybrid membrane prevent the leaching of encapsulated molecules, while cooling of the dispersion induces a burst release, in correlation with the decompaction of ELP chains.







Abstract
Biomimetic design to afford smart functional biomaterials with exquisite properties represents synthetic challenges and provides unique perspectives. In this context, elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) recently became highly attractive building blocks in the development of lipoprotein&#8208;based membranes. In addition to the bioengineered post&#8208;translational modifications of genetically encoded recombinant ELPs developed so far, we report here a simple and versatile method to design biohybrid brush&#8208;like lipid&#8208;grafted&#8208;ELPs using chemical post&#8208;modification reactions. We have explored a combination of methionine alkylation and click chemistry to create a new class of hybrid lipoprotein mimics. Our design allowed the formation of biomimetic vesicles with controlled permeability, correlated to the temperature&#8208;responsiveness of ELPs.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Aliphatic Fluorides via Reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation</title>

A direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkyl halides has been established, by demonstrating the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations exhibited high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Monofluorinated alkyl compounds are of great importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Herein, we describe a direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoromethylation of unactivated alkyl halides using a low&#8208;cost industrial raw material, bromofluoromethane, by demonstrating a general and efficient reductive cross&#8208;coupling of two alkyl halides. Results with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;fluoroalkane also demonstrate the viability of monofluoroalkylation, which further established the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations demonstrate high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Mechanistic studies support a radical pathway. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction is first&#8208;order dependent on catalyst and alkyl bromide whereas the generation of monofluoroalkyl radical is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step. This strategy provides a general and efficient method for the synthesis of aliphatic fluorides.

Mitochondria&#8208;targeting AIE photosensitizer is specifically synthesized inside cancer cells, realizing precise photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Maximization of phototoxic damage on tumor with minimized side effect on normal tissue is essential for effective anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). This requires highly cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific or even cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;organelle&#8208;specific synthesis or delivery of efficient photosensitizers (PSs) in vitro and in vivo, which is difficult to achieve. Herein, we report a strategy of cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;activated PS synthesis, by which an efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) feature can be selectively synthesized as an efficient image&#8208;guided PDT agent inside cancer cells. MOF&#8208;199, a CuII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework, was selected as an inert carrier to load the PS precursors for efficient delivery and served as a CuI catalyst source for in situ click reaction to form PSs exclusively in cancer cells. The in situ synthesized PS showed mitochondria&#8208;targeting capability, allowing potent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific ablation under light irradiation. The high specificity of PSs produced in cancer cells also makes it safer post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder Dimerization of ortho&#8208;Quinols in Natural Product (Bio)Synthesis: Bioinspired Chemical 6&#8208;Step Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Maytenone</title>

Biosynthesis of many natural bicyclo[2.2.2]octenone products involves the Diels&#8211;Alder cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols according to the same selectivity rules. This is illustrated by the enzyme&#8208;free synthesis of the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone, first achieved by a chiral iodane&#8208;mediated dearomative hydroxylation of (+)&#8208;ferruginol and a high pressure&#8208;promoted Diels&#8211;Alder reaction.







Abstract
Many natural products of plant or microbial origins are derived from enzymatic dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenolic precursors into 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienones. These so&#8208;called ortho&#8208;quinols cyclodimerize via a remarkably selective bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Whether or not the intervention of catalytic or dirigent proteins is involved during this final step of the biosynthesis of these natural products, this cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols can be chemically reproduced in the laboratory with the same strict level of site&#8208;specific regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This unique yet unified process, which finds its rationale in the inherent chemical reactivity of those ortho&#8208;quinols, is illustrated herein by an efficient and bioinspired first chemical synthesis of one of the most structurally complex and synthetically challenging examples of such natural cyclodimers, the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone.

In this work, we developed pH&#8208;responsive DNA switching circuits for directing mechanical deformation of microgel swelling system through multiple chemical pathways of soft matter computing with chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
Developing smart material systems for performing different tasks in diverse environments remains challenging. Here, we show that by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials with multi&#8208;mode reconfigurable DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction circuits (D&#8208;CRCs), it can control size change of microgels with multiple reaction pathways and adapt expansion behaviors to meet diverse environments. We first use pH&#8208;responsive intramolecular conformational switches for regulating DNA strand displacement reactions (SDRs). The ability to regulate SDRs with tunable pH&#8208;dependence allows to build dynamic chemical reaction networks with diverse reaction pathways. We confirm that the designed DNA switching circuits are reconfigurable at different pH and perform different logic operations, and the swelling of DNA switching circuit&#8208;integrated microgel systems can be programmably directed by D&#8208;CRCs. Our approach provides insight into building smart responsive materials and fabricating autonomous soft robots.

         <title>Cooperative Bond Activation and Facile Intramolecular Aryl Transfer of Nickel&#8211;Aluminum Pincer&#8208;type Complexes</title>

Nickel complexes supported by a pincer&#8208;type aluminum metalloligand were synthesized and demonstrated several unique modes of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. Unexpectedly, the PAlP framework reversibly converts between the alane and aluminyl through aryl group transmetalation between aluminum and nickel.







Abstract
Pincer&#8208;type nickel&#8211;aluminum complexes were synthesized using two equivalents of the phosphinoamide, [PhNCH2PiPr2]&#8722;. The Ni0&#8211;AlIII complexes, {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;N2) and {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;COD), where MesPAlP is (Mes)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2, were structurally characterized. The (PAlP)Ni system exhibited cooperative bond cleavage mediated by the two&#8208;site Ni&#8211;Al unit, including oxidative addition of aryl halides, H2 activation, and ortho&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond activation of pyridine N&#8208;oxide. One intriguing reaction is the reversible intramolecular transfer of the mesityl ring from the Al to the Ni site, which is evocative of the transmetalation step during cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The aryl&#8208;transfer product,(THF)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2Ni(Mes), is the first example of a first&#8208;row transition metal&#8211;aluminyl pincer complex. The addition of a judicious donor enables the Al metalloligand to convert reversibly between the alane and aluminyl forms via aryl group transfer to and from Ni, respectively. Theoretical calculations support a zwitterionic Ni&#948;&#8722;&#8211;Al&#948;+ electronic structure in the nickel&#8211;aluminyl complex.

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence&#8211;Spin Label Probe for Visualization and Quantification of Target Molecules in Tissue by Multiplexed FLIM&#8211;EPR Spectroscopy</title>

A novel multi&#8208;label synthetic platform for a functional dual fluorescence&#8211;spin label probe enables the non&#8208;destructive simultaneous quantification and visualization of molecules in biological tissue. Multiplexed FLIM and EPR spectroscopy avoids analytical inconsistencies between both techniques. Beside tissue applications, molecular spectroscopic studies of biomolecular conformation, structure, dynamics, and microenvironment are feasible.







Abstract
Simultaneous visualization and concentration quantification of molecules in biological tissue is an important though challenging goal. The advantages of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for visualization, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for quantification are complementary. Their combination in a multiplexed approach promises a successful but ambitious strategy because of spin label&#8208;mediated fluorescence quenching. Here, we solved this problem and present the molecular design of a dual label (DL) compound comprising a highly fluorescent dye together with an EPR spin probe, which also renders the fluorescence lifetime to be concentration sensitive. The DL can easily be coupled to the biomolecule of choice, enabling in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro applications. This novel approach paves the way for elegant studies ranging from fundamental biological investigations to preclinical drug research, as shown in proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle penetration experiments in human skin ex&#8197;vivo.

From the teaching class with the bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of ortho&#8208;quinols drawn on the chalk board to the laboratory with the (+)&#8208;ferruginol substrate and a chiral bisiodyl reagent in the flask: The single ortho&#8208;quinol diastereomer thus produced combines in pairs to reach a C2&#8208;symmetric transition state in which [4+2] and [2+4] processes are equivalent, as described by Laurent Pouys&#233;gu, St&#233;phane Quideau, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;14967. Under high pressure, this transition state leads to the product, the natural (+)&#8208;maytenone, which was first isolated from the plant Maytenus dispermus, here appearing in the background image. Design by Jean Ung@SQuideau Lab.

A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another undergoes bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion with a low barrier. This inversion resembles that of an umbrella flipped by the strong wind. The transition state is not planar, but possesses a rather twisted, S&#8208;shaped conformation with Ci symmetry. The bowl&#8208;inversion mechanism follows a quadruple&#8208;well potential model, as reported by Andrzej&#8197;L. Sobolewski, Micha&#322;&#8197;K. Cyra&#324;ski, Daniel&#8197;T. Gryko, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;14998.

Access to the elusive UV solar&#8208;blind region based on direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) enabled by a non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based phosphate crystal is reported by Chi Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;14806. The rare coexistence of UV solar&#8208;blind&#8208;region phase&#8208;matchable optical nonlinearity and anisotropy, including wide UV transparency, large SHG response, and sufficient birefringence, can be attributed to the introduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations and their favorable collaboration with phosphate anions.

A porous molecular crystal assembled by close&#8208;packing of macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate efficiently captures CO2, as reported by Ognjen&#8197;&#352;. Miljani&#263;, Teng&#8208;Hao Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;14931. The square 7.1&#215;7.1 &#197; pores enable excellent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance via both kinetic and thermodynamic effects. Moderately strong CO2&#8211;framework interactions allow easy regeneration of the adsorbent and its use in pressure swing adsorption.

Nuclear hyperpolarization is a powerful method that can dramatically enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy. This technology has been applied to the biomedical molecular imaging of a range of small molecules with stable isotopes and has provided valuable metabolic and physiological information. This review focuses on strategies for the design of molecular probes for hyperpolarized bioimaging.







Abstract
Nuclear hyperpolarization has emerged as a method to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy. By application of this powerful tool, small molecules with stable isotopes have been used for highly sensitive biomedical molecular imaging. The recent development of molecular probes for hyperpolarized in vivo analysis has demonstrated the ability of this technique to provide unique metabolic and physiological information. This review presents a brief introduction of hyperpolarization technology, approaches to the rational design of molecular probes for hyperpolarized analysis, and examples of molecules that have met with success in vitro or in vivo.

Organic transformations using electric current as a sustainable activator are a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field. However, different scientific backgrounds have led to a loss of important information being reported. Several pitfalls and misunderstandings regarding important parameters exist, which can cause challenges in reproducibility, even though electrical current is able to dial&#8208;in various reactivities.







Abstract
The use of electric current as a traceless activator and reagent is experiencing a renaissance. This sustainable synthetic method is evolving into a hot topic in contemporary organic chemistry. Since researchers with various scientific backgrounds are entering this interdisciplinary field, different parameters and methods are reported to describe the experiments. The variation in the reported parameters can lead to problems with the reproducibility of the reported electroorganic syntheses. As an example, parameters such as current density or electrode distance are in some cases more significant than often anticipated. This Minireview provides guidelines on reporting electrosynthetic data and dispels myths about this technique, thereby streamlining the experimental parameters to facilitate reproducibility.

This review examines and summarizes the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the complex biological barriers on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.







Abstract
Nanogels have been identified as outstanding nanocarrier candidates for drug delivery due to their desirable physiochemical properties and versatile applicability for diverse therapeutic molecules and imaging probes. One of the main challenges that hinder the clinical translation of nanogels is the low efficiency of drug delivery to the target sites because of the complex biological barriers during the in&#8197;vivo journey. The purpose of this review is to examine and summarize the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the barriers and challenges on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In particular, the functional moieties or domains have been incorporated in the nanogels, allowing them to spontaneously regulate their structure and physiochemical properties to cross one or more of the multifaceted barriers. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.

         <title>Biological Nanopore Approach for Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Sequencing</title>

Nanopore electrochemistry offers a bright prospect for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing by measuring specific interactions between amino acids based on their natural structure and chemistry continuity and diversity. This Minireview focusses on recent advances in biological nanopores from protein unfolding, peptide translocation, amino acid identification to diagnostic application.







Abstract
Proteins are responsible for the occurrence and treatment of many diseases, and therefore protein sequencing will revolutionize proteomics and clinical diagnostics. Biological nanopore approach has proved successful for single&#8208;molecule DNA sequencing, which resolves the identities of 4 natural deoxyribonucleotides based on the current blockages and duration times of their translocations across the nanopore confinement. However, open challenges still remain for biological nanopores to sequentially identify each amino acid (AA) of single proteins due to the inherent complexity of 20 proteinogenic AAs in charges, volumes, hydrophobicity and structures. Herein, we focus on recent exciting advances in biological nanopores for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) from native protein unfolding, control of peptide translocation, AA identification to applications in disease detection.

Inspired by natural rhodopsin, an azobenzene&#8208;based molecular rotaxane was designed to insert into lipid membranes for the regulation of ion transport. Based on the shuttle transport mechanism, the significant difference in shuttling rate between trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomer caused by molecular isomerization facilitates light&#8208;gated ion transport.







Abstract
Inspired by the nontrivial and controlled movements of molecular machines, we report an azobenzene&#8208;based molecular shuttle PR2, which can perform light&#8208;gated ion transport across lipid membranes. The amphiphilicity and membrane&#8208;spanning molecular length enable PR2 to insert into the bilayer membrane and efficiently transport K+ (EC50=4.1&#8197;&#956;m) through the thermally driven stochastic shuttle motion of the crown ether ring along the axle. The significant difference in shuttling rate between trans&#8208;PR2 and cis&#8208;PR2 induced by molecular isomerization enables a light&#8208;gated ion transport, i.e., ON/OFF in situ regulation of transport activity and single&#8208;channel current. This work represents an example of using a photoswitchable molecular machine to realize gated ion transport, which demonstrates the value of molecular machines functioning in biomembranes.

Based on the shuttle transport mechanism, the significant difference in shuttling rate between &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-isomer caused by molecular isomerization facilitates light-gated ion transport.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the nontrivial and controlled movements of molecular machines, we report an azobenzene-based molecular shuttle &lt;b&gt;PR2&lt;/b&gt;, which can perform light-gated ion transport across lipid membranes. The amphiphilicity and membrane-spanning molecular length enable &lt;b&gt;PR2&lt;/b&gt; to insert into the bilayer membrane and efficiently transport K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=4.1&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;) through the thermally driven stochastic shuttle motion of the crown ether ring along the axle. The significant difference in shuttling rate between trans-&lt;b&gt;PR2&lt;/b&gt; and cis-&lt;b&gt;PR2&lt;/b&gt; induced by molecular isomerization enables a light-gated ion transport, i.e., ON/OFF in situ regulation of transport activity and single-channel current. This work represents an example of using a photoswitchable molecular machine to realize gated ion transport, which demonstrates the value of molecular machines functioning in biomembranes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Directed Evolution of an Improved Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase for Incorporation of L&#8208;3,4&#8208;Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)</title>

Catechols are capable of diverse interactions with metals, radical chemistry, the ability to form redox&#8208;mediated crosslinks, and play an important role in many biological polymers. Genetic tools are presented that enable site&#8208;specific incorporation of the catechol amino acid 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) into proteins in bacteria, and a new DOPA&#8208;specific fluorescent biosensor for monitoring incorporation in living cells.







Abstract
The catechol group of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) derived from L&#8208;tyrosine oxidation is a key post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) in many protein biomaterials and has potential as a bioorthogonal handle for precision protein conjugation applications such as antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. Despite this potential, indiscriminate enzymatic modification of exposed tyrosine residues or complete replacement of tyrosine using auxotrophic hosts remains the preferred method of introducing the catechol moiety into proteins, which precludes many protein engineering applications. We have developed new orthogonal translation machinery to site&#8208;specifically incorporate L&#8208;DOPA into recombinant proteins and a new fluorescent biosensor to selectively monitor L&#8208;DOPA incorporation in vivo. We show simultaneous biosynthesis and incorporation of L&#8208;DOPA and apply this translation machinery to engineer a novel metalloprotein containing a DOPA&#8208;Fe chromophore.

         <title>Electron Beam Irradiation&#8208;Induced Formation of Defect&#8208;Rich Zeolites under Ambient Condition within Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14858-14863, June 25, 2021. </description>

Defect&#8208;rich Na&#8208;A zeolites were synthesized by electron beam irradiation under ambient condition within minutes. The as&#8208;synthesized Na&#8208;A shows enhanced adsorption performance for CO2 and heavy ions in comparison with samples synthesized hydrothermally.







Abstract
Zeolites are a well&#8208;known family of microporous aluminosilicate crystals with a wide range of applications. Their industrial synthetic method under hydrothermal condition requires elevated temperature and long crystallization time and is therefore quite energy&#8208;consuming. Herein, we utilize high&#8208;energy electron beam irradiation generated by an industrial accelerator as a distinct type of energy source to activate the formation reaction of Na&#8208;A zeolite. The initial efforts afford an attractive reaction process that can be achieved under ambient conditions and completed within minutes with almost quantitative yield, leading to notable energy saving of one order of magnitude compared to the hydrothermal reaction. More importantly, electron beam irradiation simultaneously exhibits an etching effect during the formation of zeolite generating a series of crystal defects and additional pore windows that can be controlled by irradiation dose. These observations give rise to significantly enhanced surface area and heavy metal removal capabilities in comparison with Na&#8208;A zeolite synthesized hydrothermally. Finally, we show that this method can be applied to many other types of zeolites.

         <title>In&#8197;Cellulo M&#246;ssbauer and EPR Studies Bring New Evidence to the Long&#8208;Standing Debate on Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster Binding in Human Anamorsin</title>

A combined in&#8197;cellulo M&#246;ssbauer&#8208; and EPR&#8208;based approach is applied to address controversial aspects of Fe&#8211;S cluster&#8208;binding properties of human anamorsin, a protein involved in the biogenesis of cytosolic [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster&#8208;binding proteins. We show that human anamorsin binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters in&#8208;cell in two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs typical of the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family, with different electron&#8208;spin&#8208;relaxation properties.







Abstract
Human anamorsin is an iron&#8211;sulfur&#8201;(Fe&#8211;S)&#8208;cluster&#8208;binding protein acting as an electron donor in the early steps of cytosolic iron&#8211;sulfur protein biogenesis. Human anamorsin belongs to the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family and contains two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs, each binding an Fe&#8211;S cluster. In&#8197;vitro works by various groups have provided rather controversial results for the type of Fe&#8211;S clusters bound to the CIAPIN1 proteins. In order to unravel the knot on this topic, we used an in&#8197;cellulo approach combining M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies to characterize the iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster&#8208;bound form of human anamorsin. We found that the protein binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters at both its cysteine&#8208;rich motifs.

         <title>Changing the Reactivity of Zero&#8208; and Mono&#8208;Valent Germanium with a Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Bis(silylenyl)carborane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14864-14868, June 25, 2021. </description>

The bis(silylenyl) ortho&#8208;dicarborane&#8208;supported zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (germylone) 1 undergoes facile dimerization with Ge&#8722;Ge bond formation upon one&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction to furnish the bis(silylene)&#8208;supported dicationic and dianionic [GeI&#8211;GeI] complexes 2 and 3, respectively. A neutral complex 4 bearing a Ge22+ dumbbell embedded in a shell of two radical&#8208;anionic di(silylenyl)dicarborane ligands could be synthesized.







Abstract
Using the chelating C,C&#8242;&#8208;bis(silylenyl)&#8208;ortho&#8208;dicarborane ligand, 1,2&#8208;(RSi)2&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 [R=PhC(NtBu)2], leads to the monoatomic zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (&#8220;germylone&#8221;) 3. The redox non&#8208;innocent character of the carborane scaffold has a drastic influence on the reactivity of 3 towards reductants and oxidants. Reduction of 3 with one molar equivalent of potassium naphthalenide (KC10H8) causes facile oxidation of Ge0 to GeI along with a two&#8208;electron reduction of the C2B10 cluster core and subsequent GeI&#8208;GeI coupling to form the dianionic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 4. In contrast, oxidation of 3 with one molar equivalent of [Cp2Fe][B{C6H3(CF3)2}4] as a one&#8208;electron oxidant furnishes the dicationic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 5. The Ge0 atom in 3 acts as donor towards GeCl2 to form the trinuclear mixed&#8208;valent Ge0&#8594;GeII&#8592;Ge0 complex 6, from which dechlorination with KC10H8 affords the neutral Ge2 complex 7 as a diradical species.

In contrast, oxidation of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with one molar equivalent of [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe][B{C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] as a one-electron oxidant furnishes the dicationic bis(silylene)-supported Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. The Ge&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; atom in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; acts as donor towards GeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form the trinuclear mixed-valent Ge&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8592;Ge&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, from which dechlorination with KC&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; affords the neutral Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; as a diradical species.&lt;/p&gt;

A novel PdII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective oxycarbonylation of alkenes has been established. The ligand, which has an ethyl group at the C&#8208;6 position of Pyox, plays a significant role in the intermolecular oxypalladation process and results in high reactivity and excellent enantioselective control.







Abstract
A novel PdII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective oxycarbonylation of alkenes has been established. The ligand with an ethyl group at the C&#8208;6 position of Pyox plays a significant role in the intermolecular oxypalladation process, leading to high reactivity and excellent enantioselective control. Compared to the conventional methods, the reaction itself features alkenes as easily prepared starting materials, mild and operationally simple reaction conditions, and insensitivities to air and water. Moreover, this method allows for broad alkene substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, scalabilities and a wide array of applications, and provides a useful route for the convenient and straightforward synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy alkylcarboxylic acids/esters.

         <title>UV Solar&#8208;Blind&#8208;Region Phase&#8208;Matchable Optical Nonlinearity and Anisotropy in a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cation&#8208;Containing Phosphate</title>

The &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#8901;3&#8201;H2O exhibits rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large second harmonic generation (SHG) response and sufficient birefringence for phase&#8208;matching at a short SHG wavelength.







Abstract
Wide ultraviolet (UV) transparency, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, and sufficient optical birefringence for phase&#8208;matching (PM) at short SHG wavelengths are vital for practical UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, simultaneously optimizing these properties is a major challenge, particularly for metal phosphates. Herein, we report a non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based UV NLO phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (GPO) with a short UV cutoff edge. GPO is SHG active at 1064&#8197;nm (3.8 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064&#8197;nm) and 532&#8197;nm (0.3 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 @ 532&#8197;nm) and also possesses a significant birefringence (0.078 @ 546&#8197;nm) with a band gap &gt;6.0&#8197;eV. The PM SHG capability of GPO can extend to 250&#8197;nm, indicating GPO is a promising UV solar&#8208;blind NLO material. Calculations and crystal structure analysis show that the rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large SHG response, and optical anisotropy is due to the introduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations [C(NH2)3]+ and their favorable arrangement with [PO4]3&#8722; anions.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Berkeleyone&#8197;A and Preaustinoids</title>

Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, we accomplished the first enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A and its five preaustinoid congeners. Meanwhile, we also uncovered a series of biomimetic rearrangements that would lend credence to the proposed biosynthetic sequence of DMOA&#8208;derived meroterpenoids.







Abstract
Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid&#8208;derived meroterpenoids (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone A and its five congeners ((&#8722;)&#8208;preaustinoids&#8197;A, A1, B, B1, and B2) in 12&#8211;15 steps, starting from commercially available 2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzoic acid hydrate. Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, our convergent synthesis features two critical reactions: 1)&#8197;a symmetry&#8208;breaking, diastereoselective dearomative alkylation to assemble the entire carbon core, and 2)&#8197;a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;mediated sequential Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation/carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework. We also conducted our preliminary biomimetic investigations and uncovered a series of rearrangements (&#945;&#8208;ketol, &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone, etc.) responsible for the biomimetic diversification of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A into its five preaustinoid congeners.

Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D-ring, our convergent synthesis features two critical reactions: 1)&#8197;a symmetry-breaking, diastereoselective dearomative alkylation to assemble the entire carbon core, and 2)&#8197;a Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated sequential Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation/carbonyl &#945;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework. We also conducted our preliminary biomimetic investigations and uncovered a series of rearrangements (&#945;-ketol, &#945;-hydroxyl-&#946;-diketone, etc.) responsible for the biomimetic diversification of (&#8722;)-berkeleyone&#8197;A into its five preaustinoid congeners.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Arylpalladium(II) Boronates: Confirming the Structure and Chemical Competence of Pre&#8208;transmetalation Intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14897-14901, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(II) boronates are fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction that are typically transient and have never been isolated. Arylpalladium(II) boronates have now been synthesized that are kinetically stable in solution, which enabled their isolation and crystallographic characterization. These species were shown to be chemically competent in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings.







Abstract
Palladium(II) boronates are recognized as fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. While these typically transient species have been detected and studied spectroscopically, it is conspicuous that they have never been isolated since this important reaction was discovered over forty years ago. This study reports the synthesis of a family of unprecedented arylpalladium(II) boronates that are, by design, kinetically stable at ambient temperature, both in solution and in the solid state. These properties enabled unambiguous crystallographic confirmation of their structure for the first time and their chemical competence in a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction was demonstrated.

         <title>A Cooperatively Activatable, DNA&#8208;based Fluorescent Reporter for Imaging of Correlated Enzymatic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14887-14891, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based fluorescent reporter operated orthogonally by the two enzymes, telomerase and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, enables the imaging of their correlated activity both in vitro and in vivo. The system was further applied to specific tumor imaging through &#8220;dual lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; strategy and analysis of the dual enzymatic activities during drug treatment.







Abstract
The dynamic variation of the expression profile and spatial landscape of multiple enzymes are crucial factors influencing tumor progression and drug treatment. However, the comprehensive analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of existing imaging technologies. Here we report a cooperatively activatable, DNA&#8208;based fluorescent reporter programmed to detect the correlated activity of dual enzymes, telomerase (TE) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), both in vitro and in vivo. The conformational change of the DNA probe can be orthogonally triggered through TE&#8208;induced DNA elongation and APE1&#8208;mediated specific cleavage, producing a fluorescent signal for imaging the activity of the two enzymes in an AND&#8208;gated manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of the system for specific tumor imaging through &#8220;dual lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; strategy, and visualizing the correlated enzymatic activities during drug treatment of cancer.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of Dysiherbol&#8197;A</title>

In a key step of the first enantioselective total synthesis of the anti&#8208;inflammatory marine meroterpene dysiherbol&#8197;A, the tetra&#8208;carbocyclic core skeleton is set&#8208;up in a unique gold&#8208;catalyzed double cyclization, and the ether bridge of the pentacyclic target structure is spontaneously formed under cyclopropane opening upon deprotection of a late intermediate.







Abstract
A 12&#8208;step total synthesis of the natural product dysiherbol&#8197;A, a strongly anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;tumor avarane meroterpene isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea sp., was elaborated. As key steps, the synthesis features an enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition/enolate&#8208;trapping opening move, an Au&#8208;catalyzed double cyclization to build up the tetracyclic core&#8208;carbon skeleton, and a late installation of the C5&#8208;bridgehead methyl group via proton&#8208;induced cyclopropane opening associated with spontaneous cyclic ether formation. The obtained pentacyclic compound (corresponding to an anhydride of the originally suggested structure for dysiherbol&#8197;A) showed identical spectroscopic data as the natural product, but an opposite molecular rotation. CD&#8208;spectroscopic measurements finally confirmed that both the constitution and the absolute configuration of the originally proposed structure of (+)&#8208;dysiherbol&#8197;A need to be revised.

A deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA for UHD display was demonstrated, which realized the desired chromaticity matching rec.2020 standard and the record external quantum efficiency beyond 30&#8201;%. It is showed that its quasi&#8208;planar structure not only improves horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation for out&#8208;coupling enhancement, but also balances the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer for radiation facilitation and quenching suppression.







Abstract
Herein, we report a deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA, composed of quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (pCNQ) acceptor and triphenylamine (TPA) donor. pCNQ&#8211;TPA supported its OLED with desired CIE coordinates of (0.69, 0.31) and the record maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.3&#8201;%, which is the best red TADF diode with Rec.2020 gamut for UHDTV. It is showed that through tuning pCNQ&#8211;TPA doping concentration, intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer are balanced to synchronously improve emission color saturation and TADF radiation, and remedy aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, rendering photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reaching 90&#8201;% for deep&#8208;red emission peaked at &#8776;690&#8197;nm. Quasi&#8208;planar structure further endows pCNQ&#8211;TPA with an improved horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation, which increases light out&#8208;coupling ratio to 0.34 for achieving the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device efficiencies.

         <dc:description>
Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;bromanes are rare and unexplored hypervalent compounds. An efficient and mild protocol affords now a large panel of these hypervalent compounds, featuring reactivity complementary to that of the corresponding diaryl &#955;3&#8208;iodanes. Due to their high reactivity, metal&#8208;free meta&#8208;selective C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N coupling occurs through in situ aryne generation.







Abstract
Despite the widespread application of hypervalent iodines, the corresponding &#955;3&#8208;bromanes are less explored. Herein we report a general, safe, and high&#8208;yielding strategy to access cyclic diaryl &#955;3&#8208;bromanes. These unique compounds feature reactivity that is appealing and complementary to that of &#955;3&#8208;iodanes, generating arynes under mild reaction conditions and in the presence of a weak base. Accordingly, formal meta&#8208;selective transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N couplings may be achieved. Mechanistic studies unambiguously support the aryne generation mechanism.

         <title>Access to Allene&#8208;Containing Molecules via Enantioselective Reactions of Azolium Cumulenolate Intermediates</title>

The first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition involving cumulenolates is disclosed. Both allene and spirooxindole products could be accessed with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities by varying the amount of the base.







Abstract
Azolium cumulenolates are a special type of intermediates in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. They contain elongated linear structures with three contiguous C=C bonds and sterically unhindered &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. These structural features make it difficult to develop enantioselective reactions for these intermediates. Here we disclose the first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition reactions of azolium cumulenolates. The reaction starts with alkynals as the precursors for azolium cumulenolate intermediates that undergo enantioselective addition to activated ketones. From the same set of substrates, both allene and spirooxindole products can be obtained with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The allene moieties in our optically enriched products carry rich reactivities and can be transformed to diverse molecules. The spirooxindole scaffolds in our products are important structural motifs in natural products and medicines.

         <title>Absolute Quantification of Drug Vector Delivery to the Cytosol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14824-14830, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macromolecular drug delivery vectors must translocate at the plasma membrane or escape from endosomes to reach the cytosol. This very inefficient process requires optimization, which is hindered by the difficulty to accurately measure cytosolic arrival. An exceptionally sensitive and robust assay to quantify this step was developed. The assay was validated by determining the absolute numbers of two macromolecular vectors reaching the cytosol.







Abstract
Macromolecular drugs inefficiently cross membranes to reach their cytosolic targets. They require drug delivery vectors to facilitate their translocation across the plasma membrane or escape from endosomes. Optimization of these vectors has however been hindered by the difficulty to accurately measure cytosolic arrival. We have developed an exceptionally sensitive and robust assay for the relative or absolute quantification of this step. The assay is based on benzylguanine and biotin modifications on a drug delivery vector of interest, which allow, respectively, for selective covalent capture in the cytosol with a SNAP&#8208;tag fusion protein and for quantification at picomolar sensitivity. The assay was validated by determining the absolute numbers of cytosolic molecules for two drug delivery vectors: the B&#8208;subunit of Shiga toxin and the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide TAT. We expect this assay to favor delivery vector optimization and the understanding of the enigmatic translocation process.

         <title>Confined Spaces in [n]Cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylenes</title>

A series of [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylenes was synthesized. K&#8208;region functionalization of the pyrene moieties led to a confined space within those macrocycles. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5 and resulted in a host&#8208;in&#8208;host binding with shape complementary alkaline crown ethers. A multifaceted approach combining computation, spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis elucidated the binding.







Abstract
A set of strained aromatic macrocycles based on [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;(4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrahydro)pyrenylenes is presented with size&#8208;dependent photophysical properties. The K&#8208;region of pyrene was functionalized with ethylene glycol groups to decorate the outer rim and thereby confine the space inside the macrocycle. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5, which leads to an internal binding of up to 8.0&#215;104&#8197;m&#8722;1 between the ether&#8208;decorated [5]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylene and shape&#8208;complementary crown ether&#8211;cation complexes. Both the ether&#8208;decorated [n]cyclo&#8208;pyrenylenes as well as one of their host&#8211;guest complexes have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In combination with computational methods the structural and thermodynamic reasons for the exceptionally strong binding have been elucidated. The presented rim confinement strategy makes cycloparaphenylenes an attractive supramolecular host family with a favorable, size&#8208;independent read&#8208;out signature and binding capabilities extending beyond fullerene guests.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Mediated Construction of an Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14875-14880, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with controlled thickness was obtained by using a surface&#8208;initiated polymerization strategy (see picture). The rigid organic skeleton and defined pore structure of the COF membrane as well as the abundance of sulfonic acid groups throughout the layer led to superior proton conductivity of 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in pure water.







Abstract
As a new class of crystalline porous organic materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention for proton conduction owing to their regular channels and tailored functionality. However, most COFs are insoluble and unprocessable, which makes membrane preparation for practical use a challenge. In this study, we used surface&#8208;initiated condensation polymerization of a trialdehyde and a phenylenediamine for the synthesis of sulfonic COF (SCOF) coatings. The COF layer thickness could be finely tuned from 10 to 100&#8197;nm by controlling the polymerization time. Moreover, free&#8208;standing COF membranes were obtained by sacrificing the bridging layer without any decomposition of the COF structure. Benefiting from the abundant sulfonic acid groups in the COF channels, the proton conductivity of the SCOF membrane reached 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in pure water. To our knowledge, this is one of the highest values for a pristine COF membrane in the absence of additional additives.

The construction of novel halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) based on iodonium&#8208;bridged N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions is reported.







Abstract
Due to the fascinating structures and wide applications, porous materials with open frameworks have attracted more and more attentions. Herein, a novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (XOF&#8211;TPPE) was successfully designed and fabricated by iodonium&#8208;bridged N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions between pyridyl groups and I+ for the first time. The formation of XOF&#8211;TPPE and its linear analogue was monitored by 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), IR, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and selected&#8208;area electron diffraction (SAED). The structural model of XOF&#8211;TPPE was established based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data and theoretical simulations. Significantly, synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), DLS and UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy experiments suggested that XOF&#8211;TPPE still maintains a stable 2D framework structure in solutions. This research opens up a novel avenue for the development of organic frameworks materials, and may bring new promising applications for the field of porous materials.

Molecular weight engineering of red&#8208;emissive mesopolymer with no detectable homo&#8208;coupling defects, fine&#8208;tuned energy level and better bipolar mobility was carried out. OFET and OLED based on the materials mark application potential in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Mesopolymers with high solubility, free of structural defects, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation open a new avenue for organic optoelectronics. Organic light emitting transistors that combine the functions of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and organic field&#8208;effect transistors. However, charge transport ability and light emitting strength are contradictory within one conjugated polymer. Herein, three low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight mesopolymers with thienopyrroledione&#8211;benzothiadiazole repeating units (meso&#8208;TBTF) were obtained. The mesopolymers show strong solid&#8208;state emission and high ambipolar carrier mobility. The molecular weights of meso&#8208;TBTF can be tuned by polymerization temperature. The mesopolymers have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of about 50&#8201;% in solution and 10&#8201;% in solid state. Polymer light emitting diodes of this material are fabricated to explore its potential use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Chasing the Mond Cation: Synthesis and Characterization of the Homoleptic Nickel Tetracarbonyl Cation and its Tricarbonyl&#8208;Nitrosyl Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14800-14805, June 25, 2021. </description>

The synthesis of the first homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation [Ni(CO)4].+ and the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ in the condensed phase is reported. They were obtained by oxidation of nickel metal in CO atmosphere and stabilized with a suitable weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
130&#8197;years after Mond discovered the first homoleptic carbonyl complex Ni(CO)4, we report on a [Ni(CO)4].+ salt as the first synthesis of any homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation in the condensed phase. It was prepared by oxidation of nickel metal with the synergistic oxidant Ag[F{Al(ORF)3}2]/0.5&#8201;I2 (RF=C(CF3)3) in CO atmosphere. This D2d&#8208;symmetric metalloradical represents the last missing entry among the structurally characterized homoleptic carbonyl cations of Groups&#8197;6 to 11. Additionally, the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ was obtained by usage of NO[F{Al(ORF)3}2] and all products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

         <title>Wiggling Mesopores Kinetically Amplified Adsorptive Separation of Propylene/Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation is an appealing technology for propylene and propane separation; however, the challenge lies in the design of efficient adsorbents which can distinguish the two molecules having very similar properties. Here we report a kinetically amplified separation by creating wiggling mesopores in structurally robust carbon monoliths. The wiggling mesopores with alternating wide and narrow segments afford a surface area of 413 m  2  g  &#8208;1  and a tri&#8208;modal pore size distribution centered at 1.5, 4.2 and 6.6 nm, respectively. The synergistically kinetic and equilibrium effects were observed and quantitatively assessed, which together ensured a remarkable propylene/propane selectivity up to 39. This selectivity outperformed not only the available carbon adsorbents but also highly competitive among the dominated crystalline porous adsorbents. In addition, the wiggling mesoporous carbon monoliths showed an excellent axial and radial compressive strength of around 5.5 MPa and 221 N cm  &#8208;1  , respectively, which ensured its great potential in practical molecular separations.</dc:description>
