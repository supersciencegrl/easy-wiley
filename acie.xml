         <title>Photoactive Luminescence in a Silver Cluster Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photo&#8208;responsive luminescent silver cluster (Ag8) was reported, whose phosphorescence can be activated through UV light irradiation in crystal state. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response of Ag8 was attributed to the photo&#8208;induced oxygen scavenging by methanol within the lattice, which relieved the quenching of the phosphorescence of the metal cluster, leading to a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response.








Abstract
Due to their atomically precise structures and tunable electronic properties, coinage metal clusters have emerged as a significant class of luminescent materials, demonstrating broad application potential in the development of optical sensors and light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recently, luminescent coinage metal clusters exhibiting novel photophysical properties, such as afterglow emission, circularly polarized luminescence, near&#8208;infrared luminescence, and x&#8208;ray excited luminescence, have been successively reported, attracting significant research attention. In this work, the first photo&#8208;responsive luminescent silver cluster (Ag8) was reported, whose phosphorescence can be activated through UV light irradiation in crystal state. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response of Ag8 was attributed to the photo&#8208;induced oxygen scavenging by methanol within the lattice, which relieved the quenching of the phosphorescence of the metal cluster, leading to a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response. Due to its reversible photoactive luminescent properties in the solid state and excellent stability, a specialized photo&#8208;responsive ink for three&#8208;dimensional printing was developed based on Ag8. This study expands the range of luminescent coinage metal clusters and offers a novel strategy for the development of coinage metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Rational Integration of Amino Functionalization and Catalytic Site Modulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs for Synergistic Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a versatile platform enabling precise modulation of the primary building blocks (PBBs) and secondary building blocks (SBBs) in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) was constructed. This research aims to address the challenge where PBBs and SBBs have struggled to improve properties in a coordinated manner while providing a novel approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of relatively inert Zr&#8208;MOFs








Abstract
The modular nature endows metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with structural precision and functional programmability. However, the predefined structural constraints of precursors and confined post&#8208;synthetic environments pose significant challenges for achieving cooperative regulation of dual modules toward unified functionality. Herein, a versatile platform enabling precise modulation of the primary building blocks (PBBs) and secondary building blocks (SBBs) was constructed. The synergistic effect between the amino functionalization of the PBBs and the regulation of catalytic sites focusing on SBBs significantly enhances the efficiency of photocatalytic processes. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of NKM&#8208;818&#8208;BDBPt can reach 871&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 10.62 times higher than that of NKM&#8208;818@Pt. This work establishes a new paradigm for exploring synergistic interactions among modular components in MOFs, and contributes to the further development of coordination&#8208;engineering&#8208;driven single&#8208;site photocatalysts with excellent activity.

         <title>Unnatural Amino Acid and Emerging Chemistry Approaches to Map RNA&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights emerging chemistries for mapping RNA&#8211;protein interactions, including genetically encoded unnatural amino acids, novel photocrosslinkers, and non&#8208;photoactivatable crosslinking systems. We compare their mechanisms, reactivity and applications, outlining how these next&#8208;generation tools enable higher&#8208;resolution, site&#8208;specific interrogation of dynamic ribonucleoprotein networks.








Abstract
RNA serves as both a genetic messenger and a functional non&#8208;coding molecule, with its activity relying on interactions with diverse proteins. Characterizing RNA&#8211;protein interactions remains challenging, particularly for dynamic or low&#8208;abundance complexes. Traditional crosslinking methods, such as UV&#8208;254&#160;nm irradiation and formaldehyde fixation, suffer from low efficiency, poor specificity, and broad reactivity, limiting their utility for high&#8208;resolution interactome mapping. Recent advances in genetic code expansion (GCE) and unnatural amino acid (UAA) incorporation now enable chemoselective, site&#8208;specific crosslinking chemistries that circumvent these limitations. This review highlights classes of crosslinkable UAAs, including benzophenone&#8208;, diazirine&#8208;, and aryl azide&#8208;based moieties, which have been used for photo&#8208;induced covalent capture of RNA&#8211;protein interactions. Next&#8208;generation modalities, such as acetophenone derivatives, halogenated UAAs, bifunctional UAAs, acyl silanes, diaryl nitrones, and photoactivatable systems further expand the toolkit for photocrosslinking and bioorthogonal labelling. Beyond UV&#8208;based approaches, latent bioreactive UAAs and proximity&#8208;induced chemistries exploit electrophile&#8211;nucleophile substitution and masked acylating agents to enable covalent capture under physiological conditions. Together, these strategies provide unprecedented control over reactivity, temporal resolution and site specificity, advancing RNA&#8208;targeted proteomics. Continued innovation in UAA&#8208;based chemistry promise to transform how RNA&#8211;protein complexes are interrogated and manipulated with molecular precision.

         <title>Engineering Gas&#8208;Releasing Polymersome Nanoreactors for Selective Biocatalytic Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the rational design of a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymersome nanoreactor system with selective activation. Upon GSH stimulation, these glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;loaded polymersome nanoreactors are capable of releasing SO2, which enhances the permeability of the polymersome membrane, thereby activating the nanoreactors&#8217; biocatalytic activity.








Abstract
Polymersomes, often referred to as polymeric vesicles, can act as nanoreactors by encapsulating enzymes within their aqueous lumen. However, most polymersome systems exhibit low membrane permeability, hindering substrate exchange and thus posing a critical challenge to their application as nanoreactors. Herein, we report the design of a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymersome nanoreactor system with selective intracellular biocatalytic activation. Upon GSH stimulation, the glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;loaded polymersome nanoreactors are capable of releasing SO2, which enhances the permeability of the polymersome membrane, thereby activating biocatalysis to convert glucose into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In vitro studies confirmed the successful cellular uptake of nanoreactors, and importantly, the biocatalytic reaction was only activated within cancer cells due to the overexpressed GSH levels, suggesting the system's &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; selectivity. Moreover, the GOx&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions, coupled with the concurrent generation of SO2, enabled the polymersome nanoreactors to exhibit enhanced cancer cell&#8208;killing capacity by modulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This work presents a new strategy for selective biocatalytic activation of nanoreactors, providing a promising platform for the development of functional polymersome systems.

         <title>Intrinsic Ni0&#8211;Ni&#948;+ Pairs in Anti&#8208;Perovskite NiNNi3 Act as Hydrogen Radical Emitters for Cu Enabling Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic Ni&#8304;&#8211;Ni&#948;+ pairs in anti&#8208;perovskite NiNNi3 act as precision hydrogen&#8208;radical emitters: their surface electrostatic potential gradient cleaves H&#9472;OH bonds, generates abundant *H while suppressing HER, and funnels spillover *H to Cu for low&#8208;barrier *NO hydrogenation, enabling ampere&#8208;level nitrate reduction to NH3 at +0.05 VRHE. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) enables ambient&#8208;condition ammonia production, while ampere&#8208;level application is still limited by the unsatisfactory efficiency due to the insufficient *H supply for rapid *NO hydrogenation. Herein, we tackled this challenge by constructing the NiNNi3/Cu heterostructure catalyst that utilizes the substantial electrostatic potential differences derived from the intrinsic Ni0&#8211;Ni&#948;+ pairs in anti&#8208;perovskite NiNNi3 to accelerate the O&#9472;H bond cleavage for *H generation, enhancing NO3RR. Consequently, the NiNNi3/Cu delivers 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 with 100&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at ultralow +0.05 VRHE. The paired electrosynthesis by coupling NO3RR with formaldehyde oxidation yields 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 0.8&#160;V, with 95% NH3&#8208;FE and 90% formate&#8208;FE. Importantly, industrial&#8208;level application is further demonstrated by a flow cell with 25 cm2 electrode that delivers 20 A, and produces 64&#160;g NH4Cl for 20&#160;h. This work provides a novel rationale for catalyst design that can boost *H density to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics for advanced electrosynthesis applications.

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic Ni&#8304;&#8211;Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; pairs in anti-perovskite NiNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; act as precision hydrogen-radical emitters: their surface electrostatic potential gradient cleaves H&#9472;OH bonds, generates abundant *H while suppressing HER, and funnels spillover *H to Cu for low-barrier *NO hydrogenation, enabling ampere-level nitrate reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at +0.05 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) enables ambient-condition ammonia production, while ampere-level application is still limited by the unsatisfactory efficiency due to the insufficient *H supply for rapid *NO hydrogenation. Herein, we tackled this challenge by constructing the NiNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu heterostructure catalyst that utilizes the substantial electrostatic potential differences derived from the intrinsic Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; pairs in anti-perovskite NiNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to accelerate the O&#9472;H bond cleavage for *H generation, enhancing NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Consequently, the NiNNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu delivers 1.2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 100&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at ultralow +0.05 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. The paired electrosynthesis by coupling NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR with formaldehyde oxidation yields 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low cell voltage of 0.8&#160;V, with 95% NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-FE and 90% formate-FE. Importantly, industrial-level application is further demonstrated by a flow cell with 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrode that delivers 20 A, and produces 64&#160;g NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl for 20&#160;h.

         <title>All&#8208;Scale Structural Optimization of Resiliently Crystalline Na&#8211;Ce&#8211;Sn&#8211;S Chalcogel for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na&#8211;Ce&#8211;Sn&#8211;S chalcogel model overcomes the challenge of achieving long&#8208;range order in chalcogels by using cerium ions to template a robust, 2D crystalline framework. The stoichiometric tuning of cerium provides hierarchical, all&#8208;scale control over this architecture, which arises from the coordination transformation of thiostannate clusters. The resulting robust and tunable crystalline framework is optimized for the oxygen evolution reaction, establishing a new class of chalcogels with high catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
The metal cation linker in metathesis&#8208;derived chalcogels critically governs structural evolution, porosity, and resultant physicochemical properties. However, most studies have emphasized atomic&#8208;scale functionality of metal linker within chalcogel network, with limited attention to local structural transformation and even long&#8208;range ordering. This work demonstrates the unprecedented role of cerium ions in directing the formation of a sustainable 2D crystalline Ce&#8211;Sn&#8211;S (CTS) chalcogel. The crystalline framework arises from coordination transformation of SnS4 tetrahedra within Sn2S6 dimers into distorted Sn3S4 broken&#8208;cube clusters, yielding a [Sn3S7]n2n&#8722; layered geometry. Cerium oxidation states, particularly Ce3+ enrichment, further stabilize the crystalline network via a templating effect and enhance electrocatalytic activity. The optimized CTS&#8208;5 chalcogel exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction performance, including a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the lowest Tafel slope of 80&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and stable operation for 50&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The crystalline CTS chalcogel represents a new class of aerogel materials, where robust 2D crystallinity persists even under high cation loading, enabling functional tunability without compromising network integrity.

         <title>Modulating Electron&#8208;Transfer via Covalent Assembly Polyoxometalate with Photosensitizer for Efficient H2 Evolution and Tandem Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly&#8208;sensitized Ir&#8208;2 photosensitizer and a Co7 POM was covalent integration via Schiff&#8208;base chemistry, which can modulate electron transfer mechanism from reductive to oxidative quenching process. The Ir&#8208;2@Co7 assembly exhibits exceptional photocatalytic H2 evolution performance, demonstrating &#8764;18 and 253&#8208;fold enhancements compared to its physically mixed system and the Ir&#8208;1@Co7 assembly, respectively.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency is critically dependent on electron transfer between photosensitizers (PSs) and catalysts. Herein, covalent assembly of Ir&#8208;PSs with Co7 polyoxometalate was achieved via Schiff&#8208;base condensation to adjust electron transfer pathways, the resulting Ir&#8208;2@Co7 assembly exhibits a turnover number of 2280 for H2 evolution, &#8764;18 and &#8764;253 times higher than that of its physically mixture and Ir&#8208;1@Co7, respectively. Moreover, the generated H2 can drive tandem styrene hydrogenation under ambient conditions, achieving 99.9% ethylbenzene yield. Spectroscopic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that covalent linkage switches dominant quenching mechanism from reductive to oxidative, and dramatically enhances electron quenching rate constant by over two orders of magnitude from 2.54&#160;&#215;&#160;109 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in physical&#8208;mixed system to 5.87&#160;&#215;&#160;1011 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the assembly. This work highlights the key role of covalent integration in promoting electron transfer, providing a general design principle for developing high&#8208;performance H2 evolution and tandem hydrogenation systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Channel Fluorescence Assays with Supramolecular Host&#8208;Dye Reporter Pairs for Membrane Activity Mapping of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;active peptides (MAPs) such as cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can translocate across lipid membranes and create membrane pores. The combination of a dye efflux and a supramolecular tandem membrane assay in a dual&#8208;channel format enables an advanced mechanistic characterization and an exploration of the mechanistic landscape of MAPs enabling their straightforward functional classification.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;active peptides (MAPs) are a major class of peptides that renders lipid bilayer membranes permeable for hydrophilic compounds. MAPs include cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) and pore&#8208;forming antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are believed to be mechanistically related. CPPs render the membrane sufficiently permeable to enable their own translocation, while AMPs create membrane damage and induce cell death. We report herein a fluorescence&#8208;based, dual&#8208;channel assay, which combines a classical dye efflux assay based on self&#8208;quenched carboxyfluorescein (CF) and a recently established supramolecular tandem membrane assay based on the supramolecular host&#8208;dye complex of p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (CX4) and lucigenin (LCG). The new assay provides a functional classification of MAPs, which distinguishes between their capability to directly translocate across the vesicle membrane or to induce sufficient membrane permeability to allow dye efflux. The assay was validated with melittin, penetratin, Pep&#8208;1, TP10, and various oligoarginine peptides including the TAT peptide, which confirmed their classification as CPPs or pore&#8208;forming peptides. An advanced variant of the tandem membrane assay also allowed to distinguish between the formation of transient pores and stable equilibrium pores. Overall, the established dual&#8208;channel assay provides a simple and easy to implement method for the advanced mechanistic characterization of MAPs and an exploration of their mechanistic landscape.

         <title>Axial Phosphate Coordination Driven Spin State Change in FeN4 Site for Stable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axial phosphate ligands (PO4) dynamically modulate FeN4 crystal field splitting and spin states, enhancing ORR activity and stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Understanding the structure&#8211;performance relationships of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) under realistic operating conditions remains a major challenge in electrocatalysis. In this study, axial phosphate groups (PO4) were introduced into the microenvironment of Fe single&#8208;atom sites embedded in cellulose&#8208;derived carbon (P&#8208;FeN4/CC), inducing a dynamic transformation of the crystal field from D4h to C4v and modulating the spin state through charge redistribution to better accommodate the catalytic reaction. The ligand&#8208;induced spin tunability combined with magnetic field&#8208;driven kinetic control enhances the intrinsic activity, selectivity, and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The P&#8208;FeN4/CC catalyst demonstrates a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.97&#160;V, an ultra&#8208;high kinetic current density of 179.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.85&#160;V, and retains over 90.5% of its current after 136&#160;h, considerably outperforming Pt/C&#8208;20%. In practical applications, liquid zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieve a peak power density of 280.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an impressive cycle life of 11,130 cycles (3,710&#160;h), while flexible ZABs deliver 81&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and operate stably for more than 160&#160;h. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy confirmed the critical role of axial PO4&#8208;induced modulation of Fe centers in enhancing ORR performance, offering new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance SACs.

&lt;p&gt;Axial phosphate ligands (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) dynamically modulate FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal field splitting and spin states, enhancing ORR activity and stability in Zn-air batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the structure&#8211;performance relationships of single-atom catalysts (SACs) under realistic operating conditions remains a major challenge in electrocatalysis. In this study, axial phosphate groups (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) were introduced into the microenvironment of Fe single-atom sites embedded in cellulose-derived carbon (P-FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CC), inducing a dynamic transformation of the crystal field from D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;h to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;v and modulating the spin state through charge redistribution to better accommodate the catalytic reaction. The ligand-induced spin tunability combined with magnetic field-driven kinetic control enhances the intrinsic activity, selectivity, and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The P-FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CC catalyst demonstrates a half-wave potential of 0.97&#160;V, an ultra-high kinetic current density of 179.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.85&#160;V, and retains over 90.5% of its current after 136&#160;h, considerably outperforming Pt/C-20%. In practical applications, liquid zinc-air batteries (ZABs) achieve a peak power density of 280.1&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an impressive cycle life of 11,130 cycles (3,710&#160;h), while flexible ZABs deliver 81&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and operate stably for more than 160&#160;h.

         <title>Persistent Mono&#8208;Oxo Bonding with Protactinium(V) Revealed in Highly Acidic Chloride Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protactinium(V) defies expectations. Its elusive mono&#8208;oxo bond was revealed through a combination of extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) analyses, as well as quantum chemical calculations. This bond persists even in 12&#160;M HCl.








Abstract
Protactinium is one of those long discovered elements with poorly known physico&#8208;chemical properties. In aqueous solution, protactinium(V), highly prone to hydrolysis, may or may not display oxo bonding, depending on the medium, in a way that still appears unpredictable due to a critical lack of data. Here, we probe the stability of this bond in hydrochloric acid solutions. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, complemented by ab initio calculations, reveal that a short Pa&#9472;Ooxo bond indeed exists at moderate hydrochloric acid concentration 3&#160;M and unexpectedly persists even in highly acidic conditions (12&#160;M). Our analysis identifies the coexistence of PaO(OH)Cl1, 2 species at moderate acidity and PaOCl4, 5 species at high acidity, with both pairs unambiguously displaying the characteristic mono&#8208;oxo bond, with a total coordination number of seven. Notably, EXAFS spectral fitting using geometries obtained from relativistic quantum calculations reveals a Pa&#9472;Ooxo bond length of approximately 1.83&#160;&#197;, in excellent agreement with computational predictions. This finding overturns expectations and provides new insight into early actinide bonding behavior in extreme chemical conditions. Understanding such coordination chemistry is critical for advancing nuclear fuel management and more broadly actinide&#160;science.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Activity and Stability in Reverse Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction by Forming Highly Active Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Na&#9472;Si Unit Within Silicalite&#8208;1 Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual ligand&#8208;protection approach was utilized to regulate the incorporation of Pt and Na within the silicalite&#8208;1. A newly discovered Na&#8208;decorated Pt configuration, designated as Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Na&#9472;Si, was found to significantly elevate the oxidation state of Pt, consequently improving its capacity to facilitate CO desorption. This structure restrains Pt mobility and breaks the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability.








Abstract
The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction holds significant industrial importance. While directly incorporating alkali metals can enhance the catalytic activity, its contribution to enhancing stability remains rather limited. Encapsulating metal centers within zeolites offers a solution to increase stability, however the fine structure of inner active units is hard to control, bringing negative impact on activity. In this work, a dual ligand&#8208;protected strategy to control the hybridization of Pt and Na species within silicalite&#8208;1 (S1) frameworks is reported, which possesses simultaneously&#8208;improved activity and stability compared with conventional RWGS catalysts. Specifically, the catalyst achieves an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) of 207,156.4 h&#8722;1 with 100% CO selectivity at 350&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, it retains high activity even after undergoing accelerated aging tests at 800&#160;&#176;C. Further mechanistic investigations uncover the formation of a novel Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Na&#9472;Si unit within the confined space of S1, where a skeletal oxygen atom simultaneously coordinates with one Na&#8314; ion and one Pt atom. In this hybrid structure, the Pt centers exhibit a significantly&#8208;raised oxidation state, which was identified as the key factor for the enhancement in RWGS activity: the positive oxidation state facilitates CO desorption, thereby promoting the forward progression of the reaction.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Photoluminescence Spectral Narrowing in X&#8208;Aggregates Dye via Self&#8208;Absorption Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual spectral narrowing in photoluminescence (PL) under pressure was achieved in a crystal with X&#8208;aggregate packing, in sharp contrast to the conventional pressure&#8208;induced spectral broadening and PL quenching reported in other material systems. This unique phenomenon arises from the combined effects of intensified self&#8208;absorption and weakened exciton coupling within the X&#8208;aggregates.








Abstract
Piezochromic materials typically exhibit spectral broadening and photoluminescence (PL) quenching, largely due to the formation of multiple emissive species and non&#8208;radiative states. Achieving pressure&#8208;induced spectral narrowing in organic systems, however, remains elusive. Herein, we report the first observation of pressure&#8208;driven PL spectral narrowing in ZPH crystals, a multi&#8208;resonant emitter featuring B/N&#8208;skeletons and characterized by an X&#8208;aggregate packing motif and strong absorption&#8208;PL spectral overlap. Under hydrostatic pressure, the absorption&#8208;PL spectral overlap markedly increases. This enhanced spectral overlap intensifies the self&#8208;absorption effect, thereby diminishing the intensity of the main PL peak. Concurrently, below 8.93&#160;GPa, the exciton coupling of X&#8208;aggregates is slightly weakened, resulting in an enhancement of the PL shoulder peak. The opposing intensity changes of these dual peaks, attributable to the combined effects of intensified self&#8208;absorption and weakened X&#8208;aggregate exciton coupling, collectively lead to the observed pressure&#8208;induced spectral narrowing. This work establishes a counterintuitive strategy by leveraging self&#8208;absorption for spectral control, thereby advancing our understanding of how the self&#8208;absorption influences photophysical properties.

         <title>Migratory C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twofold C&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling platform that synergistically combines a through&#8208;space 1,n&#8208;M/H shift with photoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is reported. This mild protocol enables the migratory cross&#8208;coupling of diverse aryl bromides and even less reactive aryl chlorides with the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in arenes, alkenes, and ethers, delivering migratory C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H coupled products with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.








Abstract
Direct twofold C&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling between two readily available substrates offers a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical alternative to traditional cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here we report the successful realization of this transformation through a dual catalytic platform that combines two orthogonal C&#9472;H activation modes: nickel&#8208;catalyzed through&#8208;space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift and photoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This synergistic strategy enables regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of substituted alkenes or arenes from aryl bromides (or chlorides) and abundant alkanes with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that HAT is the rate&#8208;limiting step, while radical addition and subsequent reductive elimination collectively govern the observed regioselectivity.

Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that HAT is the rate-limiting step, while radical addition and subsequent reductive elimination collectively govern the observed regioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Traffic Control: Fast Mg2+ Transport via Carbonyl&#8208;Induced Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Covalent Organic Framework Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a carbonyl&#8208;mediated &#8220;Molecular Traffic Control&#8221; system within Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF channels, which accelerates Mg2+ transport via ion&#8208;dipole interactions that promote dissociation, desolvation, and rapid (001) migration. This intrinsic kinetic enhancement yields a high&#8208;capacity cathode with remarkable rate capability and stability. Our finding that organic active sites can be engineered to orchestrate ion flow establishes a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;power energy storage materials.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have garnered significant attention due to their high energy density, abundant resources, and inherent safety. However, developing cathode materials with both high specific capacity and excellent kinetic performance remains a significant challenge. In this study, two carbonyl&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF and Tp&#8208;DAA COF, were successfully synthesized via a molecular engineering strategy. Among them, the Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF, with a higher density of carbonyl sites, exhibits superior performance in terms of specific capacity and rate capability. Mechanistic investigations revealed that reversible storage of Mg2+ is achieved through the enolization reaction of carbonyl groups. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations indicated that the carbonyl oxygen acts as a negatively charged center, facilitating Mg2+ dissociation via ion&#8208;dipole interactions and modulating the ion distribution within the COF channels. This significantly reduces the diffusion energy barrier for Mg2+ within the porous framework. As a result, the Tp&#8208;DAAQ COF cathode exhibits not only a high ion diffusion rate but also exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 72% capacity retention over 4000 cycles at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work highlights carbonyl&#8208;rich COFs potential as RMBs cathode, elucidates their high kinetics mechanism, and provides insights into RMBs advanced organic cathode structural design.

         <title>Three&#8208;Motif Molecular Junction with Long&#8208;Lived Charge Carriers for Efficient Overall Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that a covalently connected three&#8208;motif molecular junction synthesized via sequential polymerization significantly enhances visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 production (4302&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) from air and water by dramatically extending carrier lifetime (&#8764;12&#160;ns) and facilitating a stepwise one&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway.








Abstract
Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from air and water has emerged as one of promising alternative strategies to the conventional anthraquinone process. Nevertheless, its practical development is impeded by limited charge separation efficiency and rapid charge&#8208;carrier recombination. In this study, a covalently connected molecular junction is synthesized via sequential Schiff and Knoevenagel polymerization reactions for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 synthesis. The molecular junction effectively promotes charge separation and enhances photocatalytic efficiency. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TAS) spectra reveals that construction of the three&#8208;motif molecular junction dramatically extends carrier lifetimes up to 12&#160;ns, which is about 100 times longer than the two&#8208;motif junction. As expected, the three&#8208;motif molecular junction (TAS4) exhibits an impressive photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 4302&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under AM 1.5G irradiation without any sacrificial agent in air atmosphere, which is 2.4 and 2 times higher than that of the two&#8208;motif junctions (TA and TS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirm that H2O2 production on three&#8208;motif molecular junction TAS4 occurs via a stepwise one&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This work demonstrates the potential of molecular junction for efficient solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production.

         <title>Engineering Photo&#8208;Controlled Dynamic Conjugation Switching in Azine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosted Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;controlled dynamic conjugation switching from localized ground states to delocalized excited states was established in azine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through tuning the electronic effect of building blocks. This conjugation switching could not only promote electron transfer in the excited state but also suppress the carrier recombination, thereby facilitating efficient overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.








Abstract
Photocatalysis holds transformative potential for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with predesignable structures and exceptional light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, are promising photocatalysts; however, their catalytic efficiency is critically limited by rapid electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we report a dynamic conjugation&#8208;switching strategy in azine&#8208;linked COFs by regulating the electronic effects of the building blocks. Specifically, we constructed three azine&#8208;based COFs using high electron&#8208;affinity triphenyltriazine (TPTA) for COF&#8208;TPTA, moderate electron&#8208;affinity triphenylbenzene (TPB) for COF&#8208;TPB, and low electron&#8208;affinity triphenylamine (TPA) for COF&#8208;TPA. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal a state&#8208;dependent conjugation in COF&#8208;TPB, characterized by ground&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;electron localization and excited&#8208;state delocalization, leading to a mismatch in its electron structure between the ground and excited states that suppresses carrier recombination. Capitalizing on its optimal conjugation&#8208;switching and favorable oxygen reduction dynamics, COF&#8208;TPB delivers an H2O2 production rate of 1205&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from O2 and H2O, outperforming COF&#8208;TPTA and COF&#8208;TPA by 6.2 and 1.9 times, respectively. Importantly, the generalizability of this mechanism to other azine&#8208;based systems allowed for the development of a photocatalyst with a high rate of 1463&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work pioneers a dynamic electronic&#8208;structure engineering paradigm for photocatalyst optimization, offering transformative insights into photocatalyst design.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Triggered Anion Transport Induces Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive transmembrane anion transporters that are activated with NIR light are reported. Experiments in cancer cells revealed that NIR activation of the ionophore triggered near&#8208;IR light&#8208;dependent chloride influx and triggered cell death.








Abstract
Artificial transmembrane anion carriers have shown potential in biological research and medicine, such as chemotherapeutics to treat channelopathies and anticancer agents. Stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, controlled by triggers such as light, pH, redox, enzymes, or membrane potential, offer the potential for targeted activation. Photoactivation of ion transport is particularly advantageous due to the possibility of achieving spatiotemporal control, remote addressability, and reduced cytotoxicity. However, poor tissue penetration and undesired cytotoxicity are significant drawbacks to many photo&#8208;activated ionophores reported to date, which are mostly triggered by UV or violet light. Here, we report BODIPY&#8208;caged photo&#8208;responsive anionophores activated with NIR light, which utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of a 4&#8208;hydroxyisophthalamide motif. Caging of the hydroxyl group of the anionophore with BODIPY&#8208;photocages locks the amide proton through six&#8208;membered intramolecular hydrogen bonding, rendering it unavailable for anion recognition and transport. Decaging with 730&#160;nm NIR irradiation reverses the hydrogen bonding pattern to switch on binding, with efficient off&#8208;on activation profiles observed in anion transport experiments in vesicles. Analogous experiments in cancer cells revealed turn&#8208;on transmembrane chloride transport and a dramatic, dose&#8208;dependent decrease in cell viability following NIR decaging of the anionophore, demonstrating the potential for NIR&#8208;triggered ionophores as an alternative to existing photodynamic therapies for cancer.

         <title>Patching Solid Electrolyte Interphase via Modulating Anion Decomposition Reactions for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the decomposition reactions of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) by increasing the overpotential of anodes is proposed to rapidly patch fractured solid electrolyte interphase. This approach promotes the rapid and complete decomposition of FSI&#8722;, thereby reducing the accumulation of inactive lithium compounds.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium (Li) metal anodes undergoes repeated rupture and patching during cycles, which induces the formation of inactive Li and the rapid failure of Li metal batteries. The inactive Li compounds used to patch SEI dominate inactive Li for highly reversible Li metal anodes. Herein, patching SEI rapidly by modulating decomposition reactions of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) in the electrolyte is proposed to decrease the amount of inactive Li compounds. Increasing overpotential of anodes can promote the fast and complete decomposition reactions of FSI&#8722;, which increases the amount of insoluble inorganic components in the decomposition products of one FSI&#8722;. Abundant insoluble inorganic components can build SEI efficiently to avoid the further decomposition of the electrolyte. Then, a protocol is proposed to increase overpotential of anodes by applying a high current density within a short time during the final stage of Li deposition in Li metal batteries. With the proposed protocol, the amount of inactive Li compounds decreases by 62.2%. Furthermore, a prototype pouch cell of 411 Wh kg&#8722;1 achieves 202 stable cycles. This work provides a fresh understanding of SEI formation and inspires a new strategy to stabilize SEI.

         <title>Nanocluster&#8208;Stabilized Sulfur&#8208;Based Superradical with High Photothermal Performance and NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;kill two birds with one stone&#8221; method for radical stabilization and multifunctionalization was introduced. As an illustration, the superradical Au64(CPT)31S&#183; was produced via solvent&#8208;assisted (irradiation) homolysis of the thiolate S&#9472;C bond in the precursor nanocluster. Despite its exceptional robustness, it still can initiate monomer polymerization. Like its precursor, it also exhibits interesting NIR&#8208;II emission and promising photothermal conversion efficiency.








Abstract
The stabilization and multifunctionalization of radicals constitute two major challenges. We introduce a &#8220;kill two birds with one stone&#8221; methodology and illustrate the production of Au64(CPT)31S&#183; from the newly obtained precursor nanocluster Au64(CPT)32 (CPT: cyclopentanethiolate). Despite the isolated Au64(CPT)31S&#183; are ultrastable (maintain the majority under 100&#160;&#176;C for 2&#160;h in an atmospheric solution environment), they can initiate the polymerization of pentaerythritol triacrylate in 3D printing. In addition, the superradicial(which means it is not a single (super)atom but a complex system with superstability) exhibited NIR&#8208;II emission, as well as high photothermal conversion efficiencies of 82.9% and 65.1% under 532 and 980&#160;nm laser irradiation, respectively. Therefore, this study can serve as a foundation for novel superradical studies and applications and the findings hold notable implications for radical stabilization, multifunctionalization, and structure&#8211;composition&#8211;property correlations.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stabilization Strategy for Inhibiting Metal Nanoparticle Sintering Over Ceria Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel dual&#8208;stabilization strategy of constructing &#8220;deeper well and taller wall&#8221; migration energetics via proper Ge doping to inhibit the sintering of industrially important nanometer&#8208;sized Pt/CeO2 catalysts, where the Ge dopant uniquely strengthens the local but weakens the distant metal&#8208;support interaction through Ge4+&#8594;Ge2+ reduction and sustains the highly dispersed Pt particles up to 800 &#176;C.








Abstract
Ceria supported noble metals are important commercial catalysts, however, the long&#8208;term stability suffering from metal particle sintering still challenges the practical benefits. This work determines the favorable migration pathway of supported Pt particles over CeO2 surface as well as three distinct trends of isomorphous substitution in modulating the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs), via extensive ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory calculations with on&#8208;site Coulomb interaction correction. We find that, while several dopants (Ti, Ge, Sn) enhance the MSI upon contact with metal particles, Ge shows additionally an intriguing MSI weakening effect in the distant region, stemming from the reduction of tetravalence Ge into off&#8208;lattice Ge2+ cation (Ge4+ + 2Ce3+ &#8594; Ge2+ + 2Ce4+). Integrating with the dynamic bury&#8208;and&#8208;expose migratory structure inspires us to propose an effective sintering&#8208;resistance strategy of constructing dual&#8208;stabilization &#8220;deeper well and taller wall&#8221; migration energetics, simply by manipulating Ge doping content within an estimated threshold (roughly to be one tenth of Pt). Such approach can remarkably stabilize surface Pt particles with migration energy consumption being elevated by 1.80&#160;eV and exhibit broad applicability to other supported metals (e.g., Rh/CeO2), giving rise to excellent stability even under harsh experimental conditions of H2 atmosphere at 800&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Pseudotetraivprolides from Pseudomonas entomophila Provide Insights into the Biosynthesis of Detoxin/Rimosamide&#8208;Like Anti&#8208;Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudotetraivprolide is a new player among the Detoxin/Rimosamide&#8208;like natural products! Its biosynthesis requires FabD from primary metabolism and a PipDFG complex for final&#8208;step acetylation &#8211; unlocking its anti&#8208;antibotic activity.








Abstract
Novel variants of known natural product (NP) classes can provide valuable insights into their biosynthesis, mechanisms of action, and potential as drug leads across the entire class. Here, we describe a novel member of the widespread detoxine/rimosamide&#8208;like (DRL) natural products, named pseudotetraivprolide, produced by Pseudomonas strains. Pseudotetraivprolide exhibits the characteristic DRL&#8208;activity of protecting Bacillus cereus against the antibiotic blasticidin S. Through the generation of multiple deletion and complementation mutants, heterologous expression experiments, identification and structure elucidation of several derivatives, chemical synthesis of main derivatives, enzymatic characterization of individual biochemical steps, and detailed homology modelling of enzyme complexes, we elucidated key aspects of its biosynthesis. Our findings demonstrate that the primary metabolism&#8208;derived malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD) functions as a trans&#8208;AT in the biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, we suggest an order for all late&#8208;stage modifications and assign a function for the three conserved hypothetical proteins PipDFG acting as last&#8208;step acetylation complex responsible for stabilization and activation of the final product.

         <title>A Para&#8208;Selective Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovered over 150 years ago, the Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt carboxylation has established itself as one of the most well&#8208;known chemical reactions. However, the process often requires extreme pressures and high temperatures. Here, we present a unique para&#8208;selective Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt&#8208;type carboxylation that proceeds at relatively low temperatures and uses near equimolar quantities of a carboxylating agent.








Abstract
The Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction is the archetypal carboxylation reaction in organic synthesis yet generally suffers from the requirement of high temperatures and CO2 pressures. We report a Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt&#8208;type carboxylation of phenols using near equimolar amounts of a CO2 source at relatively low temperatures. The reaction uses the cesium salt of triphenylacetic acid as a combined source of base and CO2. Whereas the traditional Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction provides products of ortho carboxylation (salicylic acids), this method, which employs cesium salts, delivers high para selectivity to give 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acids. With the advantage of using near stoichiometric amounts of the carboxylating reagent, we demonstrate a practical and efficient preparation of 13C&#8208;labeled 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, thereby opening opportunities for applying Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt&#8208;type chemistry in the area of carbon isotope labeling.

We report a Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt-type carboxylation of phenols using near equimolar amounts of a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source at relatively low temperatures. The reaction uses the cesium salt of triphenylacetic acid as a combined source of base and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Whereas the traditional Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction provides products of ortho carboxylation (salicylic acids), this method, which employs cesium salts, delivers high para selectivity to give 4-hydroxybenzoic acids. With the advantage of using near stoichiometric amounts of the carboxylating reagent, we demonstrate a practical and efficient preparation of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled 4-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, thereby opening opportunities for applying Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt-type chemistry in the area of carbon isotope labeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>M&#246;ssbauer Spectroscopy on Antimony Borosulfates Reveals Weak Coordination Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weakly coordinated trivalent antimony atoms show record&#8208;breaking low chemical M&#246;ssbauer shifts, and in combination with several monovalent cations including silver, nitrosonium, thallium cations a rich crystal chemistry of closely related but different crystal structures. Sb(NH4)[B(SO4)2]4 showed a non&#8208;linear SHG response comparable to that of KDP. Finally, the thermal decomposition beyond 180&#160;&#176;C is discussed.








Abstract
With MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII&#160;=&#160;Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI&#160;=&#160;H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+), we recently described the first modular system within borosulfate chemistry comprising a three&#8208;dimensional anion. Herein, we shed light on the respective series of antimony compounds SbX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160;=&#160;Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, Ag+, Tl+, NO+, NH4+). While maintaining the same anionic topology, the compounds crystallize in the space groups I4&#175;$\bar{4}$ (no. 82), P4&#175;$\bar{4}$ (no. 81), and C2 (no. 5) and are strongly influenced by the lone pair of antimony as well as the size of the monovalent cations. In the course of this investigation SbX[B4O2(SO4)6] (X&#160;=&#160;Li+, Na+) were discovered. This borosulfate with a one&#8208;dimensional anion comprising B&#9472;O&#9472;B bridges crystallizes in the space group Pnma (no. 62) and features a new structure type. 121Sb M&#246;ssbauer spectra revealed negative isomer shifts of almost &#8722;22&#160;mm&#183;s&#8722;1 not observed before and hinting towards a very weak coordination behavior of the borosulfate anion. The spectra are confirmed by DFT calculations. Furthermore, single crystal X&#8208;ray&#160;diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and temperature programmed X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were carried out.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Engineered Photoelectrochemical Ammonia Oxidation Enabling Sustainable Hydrogen Production via Catalyst Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering enables reversible catalyst regeneration and selective hydrogen production. Operando spectro&#8208;electrochemical techniques combined with DFT calculations reveal deactivation and regeneration pathways in nonaqueous photoelectrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction. These findings establish how electrolyte composition dynamically controls reaction selectivity and catalyst stability.








Abstract
Ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) offers a promising carbon&#8208;free hydrogen production pathway under ambient conditions, yet practical implementation faces critical challenges from catalyst deactivation and competing side reactions in aqueous systems. We present an electrolyte&#8208;engineered approach to photoelectrochemical (PEC) AOR that enables both enhanced hydrogen production and reversible catalyst regeneration. By employing a non&#8208;aqueous acetonitrile electrolyte at the BiVO4 photoanode, we suppress competing oxygen evolution and NOx poisoning, achieving a 6.9&#8208;fold higher hydrogen yield than aqueous systems. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that catalyst deactivation in water is not permanent but dynamically reversible upon re&#8208;exposure to nonaqueous environment, emphasizing the solvent&#8208;governed interfacial behavior. This electrolyte&#8208;engineering approach proves broadly applicable across metal oxide photoanodes (BiVO4, WO3, &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3), establishing a universal design principle for PEC AOR systems. Our findings redefine the role of electrolyte composition in governing interfacial pathways and provide a practical framework for developing high&#8208;efficiency ammonia&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion platforms with enhanced durability and flexibility.

         <title>Enriching Higher Affinity Aptamers by Addressing the Kinetic Aspect of the DNA Strand&#8208;Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capture&#8208;SELEX for ampicillin aptamers led to the dominance of a low&#8208;affinity aptamer, while extending the target&#8208;library incubation time significantly increased the abundance of a high&#8208;affinity aptamer, revealing a previously unrecognized kinetic effect in the DNA strand displacement reaction during SELEX. Kinetic effects were also observed in aptamer selections for adenosine and voriconazole, confirming the generality of this phenomenon.








Abstract
Selection of high affinity aptamers is the basis for aptamer&#8208;related applications. Most aptamer selections prioritize thermodynamic factors such as the target concentration but neglect interaction kinetics. Using ampicillin as a target, aptamer selections were carried out based on the DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction. A low&#8208;affinity aptamer (Kd&#160;=&#160;12.7&#160;&#181;M) dominated under the typical condition of gravity flow with a short interaction time of 1 to 2&#160;min, whereas a high affinity aptamer (Kd&#160;=&#160;1.8&#160;&#181;M) dominated the library with an additional 10&#160;min incubation. These two aptamers differ only in three positions, and the strand&#8208;displacement kinetics was determined to be responsible for the selection outcomes. Kinetic effects were also observed in aptamer selection for adenosine, highlighting the broad applicability of this finding. Additionally, aptamers for a challenging target voriconazole were successfully enriched by extending incubation time. To reliably obtain thermodynamically best aptamers, a combination of low target concentration and long incubation time is recommended. This work not only yields a high&#8208;affinity and selective aptamer for ampicillin but also highlights the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in aptamer selection.

         <title>Stereochemical Dissection of the Strobilurin PKS Reveals the Complex Biosynthetic Logic of Iterative EZE Triene Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strobilurin iterative PKS assembles a remarkable EZE triene by varying its stereoselectivity during synthesis. Stereoselective 2R&#8208;methylation of the triketide intermediate by the C&#8208;terminal C&#8208;methyltransferase domain induces the KR and DH domains to invert their native stereoselectivities and produce a Z&#8208;configured intermediate.








Abstract
Type I Iterative polyketide synthases (PKS) use a limited set of catalytic extension and &#946;&#8208;processing domains to create complex polyketides. A remarkable case is that of the strobilurin PKS where a single dehydratase (DH) domain creates an EZE triene over three dehydration cycles. Here we dissect the strobilurin PKS and assay catalytic domains individually and in combination with stereo&#8208;defined synthetic substrates in vitro, to reveal the complex and varying selectivities of methylation, ketoreduction and dehydration that lead to this remarkable result. At the diketide stage all stereoselectivities are consistent with those known for other related systems, giving an E product. But at the triketide stage, 2R&#8208;methylation is selectively achieved, that is followed by rapid keto&#8208;reduction to give an unusual 3&#8208;L&#8208;alcohol. In&#8208;turn, this is eliminated to give the unusual Z&#8208;alkene. These selectivities are flexible and change in response to the structure of the substrate at every stage. This uncovers the complete and intricate regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities of a highly reducing iterative Type I PKS for the first time, and highlights the important differences to the well&#8208;studied cis&#8208;AT modular PKS &#946;&#8208;processing enzymes that appear to have inflexible selectivities.

         <title>Confined Chiral Center Stacking Induced Twisted Silica Nanoribbons for Tumor Cell Proliferation Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs silica co&#8208;assembly to impart a longitudinal stacking force within a confined space, inducing and stabilizing mesostructured chirality in peptide amphiphiles, yielding uniform twisted nanoribbons. Without any drug loading, this chiral architecture inhibits tumor cell proliferation by up to 60% by suppressing cell adhesion and activating apoptosis. This study highlights the crucial role of inter&#8208;component confinement in the construction of mesostructured chirality and its direct biological consequences.








Abstract
Chirality governs physiological processes across scales, yet the ambiguous link between molecular chirality and mesostructured chirality persists. Here, we show that while peptide amphiphiles with molecular chirality can assemble into achiral nanostructures, the co&#8208;assembly with silanes leads to left&#8208;handed helical&#8208;twisted nanoribbons and generates tumor cell activity inhibitory properties. The as&#8208;synthesized micrometer&#8208;long nanoribbons have a uniform morphology with a pitch of &#8764;340 nm, a width of &#8764;75 nm, and a thickness of &#8764;25 nm. An increase in the proportion of silane&#8208;peptide amphiphile modulates the pitch radius ratios from 4.5 to 10.4. It is proposed that the longitudinal stacking force toward the chiral centers during the silane crosslinking can successfully induce chirality transfer from the molecular to the mesostructure. Theoretical calculations confirm this mechanism reduces surface area by 35%. Without drugs, these twisted nanoribbons inhibit tumor cell activity by up to 60%, versus &lt;30% for achiral assemblies. RNA sequencing reveals that mesostructured chirality triggers apoptosis by suppressing cell adhesion and ultimately disrupting cellular metabolism. Our study focuses on the easily overlooked molecular interactions between multiple components during mesostructured chirality formation and the biofeedback role of mesostructured chirality, providing new perspectives for understanding the evolution and significance of chirality in nature.

         <title>Supramolecular Mechanoluminescence via Fluorine Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a subtle supramolecular assembly strategy involving fluorine interactions that can effectively resolve the long&#8208;standing brightness&#8208;sensitivity&#8208;durability trade&#8208;off for organic mechanoluminescence (ML) systems, which results in bright, sensitive, durable ML emission. Meanwhile, a supramolecular host&#8208;guest system has been established that enables efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer across the visible spectrum.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescent (ML) materials, capable of converting mechanical stimuli directly into light emission without external excitation, hold great potential for use in sustainable optoelectronics and wearable technologies. However, the development of organic ML systems has long been limited by the trade&#8208;off among brightness, sensitivity, and mechanical durability. Here, we present a supramolecular assembly design that overcomes this trade&#8208;off by leveraging directional fluorine interactions, i.e., well&#8208;defined C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F&#9472;C hydrogen&#8208;bonds and the rarely reported L&#8208;geometry C&#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;F&#9472;C contacts. The resulting supramolecular network stabilizes favorable molecular packing against mechanical damage while preserving optimal crystallinity, leading to bright and durable ML emission even during continuous mechanical grinding. Systematic structure&#8211;property analysis has successfully revealed the key design criteria for high&#8208;performance ML. We also establish a universal supramolecular platform that enables efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the ML host to the ML&#8208;inactive luminophores across the visible spectrum (green, yellow, and red). Furthermore, the fabricated prototype supramolecular ML stress sensors exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with naked&#8208;eye&#8208;detectable ML at an ultralow impact force of 0.05&#160;N. This work has put forward that fluorine&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly is a robust and versatile design strategy for advanced organic ML materials.

         <title>Minimalist Molecules Drive Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation to Modularly Assemble Functional Coacervate Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of phase&#8208;separating molecules with unprecedented ultralow molecular weight was reported. These molecules feature a hydrophobic head and a hydrophilic tail, forming a minimalistic framework that enables precise dissection of the fundamental interactions governing LLPS. This molecular model serves as a versatile synthon for modular construction of task&#8208;specific coacervates that support a series of key prebiotic processes.








Abstract
Although coacervates formed via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) are widely considered plausible protocell models relevant to the origin of life, identifying minimalist, ultralow&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecules (Mw &lt;300&#160;Da) capable of undergoing LLPS remains a major challenge. Here we present a class of synthetic phase&#8208;separating molecules with Mw ranging from 211 to 215&#160;Da&#8211;among the smallest known to drive coacervation. These molecules feature a modular design comprising a hydrophobic head and a hydrophilic tail, forming a minimalistic framework that significantly reduces molecular freedom and enables precise dissection of the fundamental interactions governing LLPS. Our findings reveal that LLPS is governed by a delicate balance between intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions and molecular solvation. Furthermore, this molecular architecture serves as a versatile synthon for modularly constructing a range of task&#8208;specific coacervates, including proton&#8208;responsive, redox&#8208;responsive, light&#8208;responsive, and self&#8208;fluorescent variants. These coacervates selectively accumulate diverse guest molecules and act as efficient bio&#8208;crucibles that support key prebiotic processes, such as amino acid&#8208;involved C&#9472;N coupling reactions, chiral catalysis, DNA hybridization, and energy transfer. These results provide both a molecular framework and chemical insights into the minimal requirements for LLPS, while advancing the coacervate toolkit for origins&#8208;of&#8208;life studies and synthetic cell engineering.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Responsive Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydropersulfide Donors Mitigate Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity While Preserving Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esterase&#8208;activated, triphenylphosphine&#8208;conjugated hydropersulfide (RSSH) donors are developed that selectively release RSSH in mitochondria. These compounds protect cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin&#8208;induced toxicity while enhancing its anticancer activity. Mechanistic studies reveal that these diverging effects arise from differences in basal reactive sulfur species, mitochondrial physiology, and redox states between cardiac and cancer cells.








Abstract
Therapeutic agents that protect the heart from doxorubicin (DOX) toxicity without reducing its anticancer efficacy remain a critical unmet need. We report esterase&#8208;activated hydropersulfide (RSSH) donors, alkyl sulfenyl thiocarbonate (AST&#8208;2), and acetoxy perthiocarbamate (APT&#8208;1), together with their mitochondria&#8208;targeted analogs, AST&#8208;2&#8208;TPP and APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP, which bear a triphenylphosphonium (TPP&#8314;) moiety. These compounds release RSSH upon esterase activation with tunable half&#8208;lives (20&#8211;125&#160;min in PBS, pH 7.4). LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis revealed that APT&#8208;1 elevates hydropersulfide levels in the cytosol of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, whereas its mitochondrial analog, APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP, increases levels in mitochondria. All donors attenuated DOX&#8208;induced toxicity in H9c2 cells, but in cancer cell lines (HepG2, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468, MCF&#8208;7), APT&#8208;1 did not blunt DOX cytotoxicity and APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP synergistically enhanced its activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that both APT&#8208;1 and APT&#8208;1&#8208;TPP rescue DOX&#8208;induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ATP depletion in H9c2 cells but not in HepG2 cells. Further characterization indicated that cancer cells exhibit higher basal sulfane sulfur levels and mitochondrial membrane potentials compared to H9c2 cells, suggesting that divergent redox environments may underlie these contrasting effects. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that redox heterogeneity between cardiac and cancer cells can be exploited to develop cardioprotective interventions that preserve or enhance DOX's anticancer efficacy.

The Giese&#8208;Reaction celebrates its 50. Birthday, it is a cyclic radical chain reaction centered around C,C&#8208;bond formation in a three component synthesis. This minireview speaks about the birth of the name&#8208;reaction, explains how the complete understanding of its reaction mechanism stimulates new methods in organic synthesis, and why it can proceed in living cells.








Abstract
50 years ago, a synthetic method was discovered, in which alkyl radical precursors, alkenes and hydrogen donors selectively yield 1:1:1&#8208;addition products in cyclic chain reactions. This paved the way for many variants of three&#8208;component syntheses, which became standard procedures for C,C&#8208;bond formation. For successful syntheses the different chain carrying radicals have to follow reactivity and selectivity rules. This requires knowledge of the substituent influence on substrate&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of intermolecular radical reactions. These rules were experimentally elucidated, and the synthetic method was coined &#8220;Giese reaction&#8221;. 20 years after its discovery in the chemical laboratory, biologists observed that microorganisms use the same synthetic strategy, which triggered our studies on biological cells. Although chemical rules in laboratory vessels and biological cells are the same, their different set&#8208;ups lead to very different features. Syntheses in homogeneous solution of a laboratory vessel is driven by kinetic effects. In contrast, most reactions in biological cells occur at protein/water interfaces, where thermodynamic interactions with enzymatic amino acids establish close contact between the educts. In addition, biochemical processes often start with metallo&#8208;cofactors that generate the productive radicals at the interface by long&#8208;distance electron transfer.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Regulating Promiscuous Catalysis via Substrate&#8208;Induced Transient Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient substrate&#8208;induced co&#8208;assembly between a lysine&#8208;rich peptide and Fmoc&#8208;glycine is reported in the Communication (e202511352) by David Y.W. Ng, Tanja Weil, and co&#8208;workers. The non&#8208;equilibrium nanostructure creates a reactive microenvironment enabling promiscuous amino&#8208;acid&#8208;driven hydrolysis and C&#9552;N condensation reactions. Cleavage of the labile Fmoc group triggers collapse of the assembly, illustrating how broad prebiotic catalysis could have emerged under kinetic control.

         <title>Fluorothiazynes as SuFEx Ambiphiles: Interconversion to Amino&#8208;sulfurdiimidoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;heteroatom sulfurdiimidoyl structures are highly versatile structures but hardly any synthetic methods exist to make them. Here, we present a general route to aminosulfurdiimidoyl fluorides (ASDFs) from amino difluorothiazynes. Exploiting the ambiphilic nature of fluorothiazynes, ASDFs were prepared via sequential alkylation and imination, and these were engageable as versatile SuFEx electrophiles for advanced sulfur(VI) chemistry.








Abstract
Sulfur(VI) functional groups are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry, valued for their stability and ability to modulate molecular properties. While sulfonamides, sulfones, and sulfates dominate existing drug scaffolds, more complex, multidirectional sulfur(VI) cores remain underexplored. Here, we show a viable route from amino difluorothiazynes to aminosulfurdiimidoyl fluorides (ASDFs), via sequential alkylation and imination. Leveraging the ambiphilic character of fluorothiazynes&#8212;acting as both N&#8208;nucleophile and S&#8208;electrophile&#8212;we generate thiazynium intermediates that, upon trapping with primary amides, afford ASDFs in good yields. Additionally, the potential of ASDFs as SuFEx electrophiles is demonstrated by reaction with various nucleophiles. Notably, a sulfurdiimidamide derivative was generated, which is likely the first unsymmetrically substituted tetraimidosulfur species. This work expands the toolkit of azasulfur(VI) fluorides, introducing the first general route to ASDFs as stable, functionally diverse platforms for further chemical diversification.

         <title>C&#8208;Glycosyl &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids as Structural Encoders of Peptide Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthetic approach employing customised C&#8208;glycosyl &#945;&#8208;amino acids enables the preparation of C&#8208;glycopeptides with precise spatial incorporation of non&#8208;canonical residues. NMR analyses reveal that the identity, number, and distribution of C&#8208;glycosyl units govern peptide conformations via intramolecular hydrogen bonding between backbone amides and carbohydrate side chains.








Abstract
C&#8208;glycosylation is a well&#8208;established strategy for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of peptides; however, the influence of chiral C&#8208;glycosyl amino acid incorporation on peptide conformation remains insufficiently explored. Most existing synthetic approaches restrict C&#8208;glycosyl amino acid placement to the N&#8208;terminus, C&#8208;terminus, or specific residues containing pre&#8208;installed reactive groups. Here, we present a more versatile strategy based on the design and synthesis of customized C&#8208;glycosyl amino acids. Four variants bearing protected galactopyranose, ribofuranose, sorbofuranose, or allofuranose side chains were synthesized and incorporated into peptides using a solid&#8208;phase methodology, enabling substitution at diverse sequence positions. Detailed NMR analyses revealed that each C&#8208;glycosyl &#945;&#8208;amino acid promotes distinct conformational preferences, primarily stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks between backbone amides and carbohydrate side chains. These findings uncover conformational information encoded within four non&#8208;canonical C&#8208;glycosyl &#945;&#8208;amino acids, offering new molecular tools for catalysis, materials development and drug discovery.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Spatial Decoupling of Adsorption and Transformation Sites on Ag&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ag&#8211;Cu dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom pairs on a graphitic carbon nitride surface achieve spatial decoupling of adsorption and transformation functions. The Cu1 acts as a Lewis acid center to adsorb and activate nitrate ion, while the neighboring Ag1 site serves as a dedicated hydrogenation center to rapidly convert *NO into NH3. This atomic&#8208;level spatially decoupled tandem mechanism remarkably enhances reaction selectivity, achieving highly efficient ammonia production.

         <dc:description>
The cover shows a chameleon symbolizing the ability of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) to perform different reactions under changing conditions. As a chameleon shifts color with its environment, ADHs alter their catalytic activity. The enzyme is depicted forming an aldehyde, amide, or thioester. In the Research Article (e202515469), Francesco G. Mutti and co&#8208;workers show that some ADHs catalyze oxidative coupling of primary alcohols with amines, H2S, or thiols, enabling efficient synthesis of diverse amides, thioacids and thioesters.

         <title>Engineering NIR Probes to Enhance Affinity and Clinical Workflow Compatibility for Prostate Cancer Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tri&#8208;compartment probes for prostate&#8208;cancer FGS: a modular design combining 1) a high&#8208;affinity PSMA targeting ligand, 2) an optimized NIR fluorophore that provides secondary binding within PSMA, and 3) PK modulators that tune extravasation and off&#8208;target clearance. Together, these features deliver robust tumor&#8208;specific contrast within standard RARP surgical timelines, overcoming the long waiting times that limit the clinical compatibility of existing probes.








Abstract
Positive surgical margins following radical prostatectomy increase the risk of biochemical recurrence and subsequent disease progression. Fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery (FGS) using targeted contrast agents has shown clinical benefits for several cancer types. However, current prostate cancer targeted imaging probes exhibit long pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, necessitating extended waiting periods or repeated hospital visits, limiting their integration into standard clinical workflow. To overcome this critical clinical compatibility challenge, we developed an innovative tri&#8208;compartment, chemistry&#8208;driven probe design strategy. Specifically, we developed a congeneric library of near infrared (NIR) water soluble fluorescent probes incorporating: 1) a glutamic acid&#8208;urea&#8208;lysine (EuK) ligand targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA); 2) a NIR heptamethine cyanine fluorophore optimized for enhanced PSMA binding via secondary binding site interactions; and 3) distinct PK modulators residing outside the PSMA binding pocket to promote rapid off&#8208;target tissue clearance. While molecular docking scores, photophysical properties and live&#8208;cell staining results showed similar overall performance, probes bearing PK modulators produced stronger tumor&#8208;specific fluorescence and accumulation in vivo than the control probe lacking a PK modulator. This effort enabled identification of a lead probe with robust tumor targeting and accelerated off&#8208;target clearance, providing optimal tumor&#8208;specific signal and contrast in a timeframe, fully compatible with robotic&#8208;assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) timelines.

         <title>Transitioning of the Chemical Industry Toward a Net&#8208;Zero Carbon Dioxide Emission Path</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One way to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of the chemical industry to almost zero would be the production of the platform molecules C1&#8208;compounds, olefins, aromatics, and ammonia by non&#8208;fossil pathways. The rest of the chemical production chains could be essentially left unchanged, provided the process energy input is renewable. The biggest challenges include sourcing the massive amounts of hydrogen needed and bringing the cost further down.








Abstract
Emissions from the chemical industry, both for energy and use of raw materials, account for approximately 6% of man&#8208;made greenhouse gas emissions. In order to keep global warming at acceptable levels, these emissions&#8212;as all other emissions&#8212;have to be drastically reduced. One way to do this is the elimination of fossil feedstock from chemical production and meeting the energy demand from renewable resources. This contribution shows that the essential elements are already available at scale to provide C1&#8208;building blocks, olefins, aromatics, and ammonia as the key base chemicals. Methanol can be produced from CO2 and renewable hydrogen, olefins from the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins and related processes, for aromatics, the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics process is available, supplemented by biomass and recycled polymers as feedstock, and also for ammonia process concepts with a strongly reduced greenhouse gas footprint are available. Current hurdles are the partly unattractive economic boundary conditions and the rate at which a change in the feedstock situation can be achieved. Moreover, high amounts of renewable energy are required, which accounts for about half of the current global electricity production.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Single&#8208;Atom Indium Site Regulating Ionic Interference and Adsorbed Hydrogen for Near&#8208;Unity Electrosynthesis of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;adaptive low&#8208;valent indium single atoms serve as solid&#8208;state buffering sites, inducing a potential&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior of the nitrate ion over that of the sulfate ion as a supporting oxoanion in the electric double layer of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, achieving near&#8208;unity selectivity toward the NH3 product in neutral media.








Abstract
Microenvironment modulation, involving the selective adsorption of ions and the engineering of hydrogen radicals, is critical for the neutral electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia at high current densities. In this work, self&#8208;adaptive low&#8208;valent indium single atoms SAs decorated copper&#8208;based nanosheets were investigated as a prototype. The catalyst exhibits a maximum ammonia Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 99.36% and a high NH3 yield rate of 29.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in neutral electrolyte. In&#8208;depth experiments and theoretical calculations suggest that the indium SAs optimize the local electronic distribution of the derived Cu matrix through strong p&#8208;d orbital couplings, with the electron&#8208;relay effect, thereby enhancing electron transfer and regulating the supply of hydrogen radicals to accelerate the hydrogenation process. Furthermore, in situ Raman results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the indium SAs can act as solid&#8208;state buffering sites by inducing a potential&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior of NO3&#8722; over SO42&#8722; as a supporting oxoanion in the electric double layer, consequently maintaining high reaction activity and selectivity. Herein, the as&#8208;designed electrode operates stably at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 150&#160;h in a bipolar membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with a FENH3 of &#8764;83%, indicating promising practical applications.

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;Derived 3D&#8208;Architectured Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor with High Luminescence Enables 20.26% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative molecular design strategy of incorporating &#8220;highly luminescent&#8221; and &#8220;3D&#8208;architectured&#8221; substituents into NFAs is proposed to improve its photoluminescence quantum yield and reduce nonradiative energy loss. A triptycene derivative&#8208;modified NFA TQX&#8208;IC is synthesized, showing a high PLQY of 12.80%. Binary D18:TQX&#8208;IC OSCs achieve high VOC (0.963&#160;eV) and low nonradiative energy loss (0.148&#160;eV). Ternary OSCs (D18:BTP&#8208;eC9:TQX&#8208;IC and D18:L8&#8208;BO:TQX&#8208;IC) exhibit enhanced PCEs (19.48% and 20.26%).








Abstract
Developing narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is a major challenge, but also a promising strategy to reduce nonradiative energy loss for boosting power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we design and synthesize a Y&#8208;series NFA (Y&#8208;NFA, named TQX&#8208;IC) by incorporating a triptycene&#8208;derived &#8220;highly luminescent&#8221; and &#8220;3D&#8208;architectured&#8221; substituent. Study shows that TQX&#8208;IC can suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), achieving a remarkable PLQY of 12.80%, currently one of the highest reported values among Y&#8208;NFAs. Therefore, its binary OSCs offer an exceptionally low nonradiative energy loss of 0.148&#160;eV, significantly outperforming the control Y&#8208;NFA named Me&#8208;Y (0.209&#160;eV). When incorporating it as a third component into D18:BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, ternary OSCs based on both D18:BTP&#8208;eC9:TQX&#8208;IC and D18:L8&#8208;BO:TQX&#8208;IC achieve impressive PCEs of 19.48% and 20.26%, respectively, significantly surpassing the Me&#8208;Y based ternary OSCs (18.19% and 18.23%). This enhancement of ternary systems is attributed to the reduced nonradiative energy loss, optimized exciton dynamics, improved charge transport, and optimized active layer morphology and component distribution when compared to their binary systems. Our findings demonstrate that introducing &#8220;highly luminescent&#8221; and &#8220;3D&#8208;architectured&#8221; substituent into Y&#8208;NFAs is a promising approach to enhance PLQY, thereby paving the way toward efficient OSCs.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radicals Unlock Strong C(sp3)&#9472;Si Bonds: Photocatalytic Alkylation and Silacycle Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical C(sp3)&#9472;Si bond functionalization of strong tetraorganosilicon compounds enabled by photocatalytic hydroxyl/alkoxyl radicals generated from water or alcohols has been developed. The reaction system demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating a variety of non&#8208;activated alkyl silanes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, while maintaining compatibility with diverse functional groups. This approach not only provides a new method for C&#9472;Si bond cleavage and transformation but also offers a strategy for synthesizing silicon&#8208;containing compounds via radical ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization of silacycles.








Abstract
Organosilicon reagents play a significant role in the preparation of molecules essential to synthetic chemistry, materials science, and medicinal chemistry. However, selectively transforming strong C(sp3)&#9472;Si bonds in unactivated organosilicon reagents remains a significant challenge due to their high stability and low reactivity. Herein, we report that hydroxyl radical generated from water (H2O) can effectively drive the homolysis of strong C(sp3)&#9472;Si bonds, enabling radical alkylation with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. We reveal that H2O facilitates the generation of alkyl radicals, including tertiary, secondary, and primary radicals. Even the inert Et4Si can be activated and used in radical alkylation under our methodology. Moreover, we show that this strategy can be applied to the radical difunctionalization of silacycles, leading to the synthesis of organosilicon compounds not previously achievable through other methods. We anticipate that this approach will serve as a foundation for the development of more advanced radical reactions with unactivated organosilicon reagents, thereby facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable molecules.

Abstract
We report a new class of rationally designed organic photosensitizers based on boron&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;substituted scaffolds, capable of mediating challenging triplet energy transfer (EnT) reactions under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Guided by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, we modulated the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) character of the excited state through strategic substitution on the carbazole&#8211;borane framework, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of both absorption and triplet energy levels (ET&#160;=&#160;63&#8211;70&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). The most effective catalyst outperformed traditional Ir&#8208; and xanthone&#8208;based sensitizers across benchmark EnT reactions, including E/Z isomerizations, [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloadditions, and [1,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. This B&#8211;N system enables the sensitization of coumarin&#8208;related substrates with ET&#160;&#8805;&#160;65&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, which was previously inaccessible to fully organic EnT photocatalysts. These results establish a new design principle for modular, high&#8208;energy triplet sensitizers based on organic aminoborane scaffolds.

         <title>Robot&#8208;Assisted Reconstruction and Control of the Pechmann Reaction Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an in&#8208;house built robotic platform, we systematically explored the classic Pechmann reaction across a wide range of reaction conditions, uncovering a rich and previously unexplored network of reactivity. This approach led to the discovery of 11 novel products, including rare benzofurans formed through non&#8208;classical pathways. These results highlight how automated synthesis can not only map complex reaction spaces but also actively guide organic transformations toward unexpected outcomes

Abstract
A robotic platform was deployed to map the distributions of products and by&#8208;products of the classic Pechmann reaction over a four&#8208;dimensional &#8220;hyperspace&#8221; of conditions. This systematic scan reveals the presence of 15 products of which 11 are unprecedented, including those forming by unusual mechanistic routes. In turn, the knowledge of the hyperspace allows for the deduction of causal relationships between the forming species, ultimately enabling the reconstruction of the underlying reaction network. The hyperspace approach provides a more complete description of organic reactions as dynamic networks which, depending on conditions, can be steered toward different outcomes.

         <title>Nanoclusters as Deep&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Absorbing Photocatalysts for Laser&#8208; or LED&#8208;Driven Povarov Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoclusters serve as efficient deep&#8208;red photocatalysts to drive the Povarov reaction under laser or LED light, enabling the synthesis of complex tricyclic N&#8208;heterocycles from bioactive scaffolds. Scalable photoreactions and extension to other deep&#8208;red processes establish a versatile, low&#8208;energy platform for cluster&#8208;based photochemistry.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is primarily initiated with ultraviolet/blue light, which has several drawbacks, namely, deficiencies in reaction efficiency, and scalability. Designing catalysts that can absorb low&#8208;energy light offers a promising solution aiming at these drawbacks. In this study, we showed atomically precise gold nanoclusters serve as deep&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing photocatalysts towards Povarov&#8208;type reactions driven by laser or LED irradiation, giving rise to complex tricyclic N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds derived from bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies revealed that the Au15 cluster demonstrates two&#8208;photon absorption when excited by a 700&#160;nm laser, while maintaining a single&#8208;photon excitation process under red LED irradiation. Furthermore, the versatility and broad applicability of the Au15 photocatalyst were underscored through batch&#8208;scalable photoreactions and various other deep&#8208;red light&#8208;induced reactions. Overall, the combination of nonlinear optics and photocatalysis of metal nanoclusters provides a new avenue for deep&#8208;red photocatalysis with continuous and scalable capabilities.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole Frameworks with sur&#8208;a Topology for Coupling Photoactivation of Oxygen and Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole frameworks with sur&#8208;a net were successfully synthesized and served as efficient catalysts for coupling photoactivation of oxygen and biomass. 








Abstract
Developing new topological three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) structures with strong electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) properties represents a promising approach for harvesting high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. In this study, we developed two unprecedented 3D COFs with sur&#8208;a topology by [3&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;4]&#8208;c strategy. The formation of sur&#8208;a topological structures relies on an elongated [3&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;c tetrahedral thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (DTZ)&#8208;based building block (DTZ&#8208;CHO) with lower C2&#8208;symmetry. This unit is formed by inserting linear asymmetric DTZ subunit (2&#8208;c vertex) between two 3&#8208;c vertices. The incorporation of strong DTZ&#8208;pyrene/vinyl electron D&#8211;A structures efficiently promote exciton separation and charge transfer during photocatalysis, thereby demonstrating high&#8208;efficiency coupling photoactivation performance toward oxygen and biomass. It delivers a hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis rate of &#8764;12&#8201;092&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 based on four&#8208;step direct Yeager&#8208;type oxygen photoreduction mechanism on DTZ active centers, pairing with efficient 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural photooxidation (&#8764;10&#8201;264&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). This work highlights the potential of topologically unique 3D COFs with robust D&#8208;A structures as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Industrial&#8208;Grade H2O2 Electrosynthesis via N/O&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanoreactors with Remarkable Yield and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N/O dual&#8208;doped hierarchically porous carbon nanoreactors regulated through targeted heteroatom doping and morphological engineering is demonstrated toward highly selective H2O2 production under an industrial&#8208;grade current density.








Abstract
The two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) enables sustainable electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), providing a green alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, we report N/O dual&#8208;doped hierarchically porous carbon nanoreactors (N/O&#8208;HPCNs) derived from ZIF&#8208;8 via a facile one&#8208;step pyrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;The N/O dual-doped hierarchically porous carbon nanoreactors regulated through targeted heteroatom doping and morphological engineering is demonstrated toward highly selective H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production under an industrial-grade current density.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) enables sustainable electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), providing a green alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, we report N/O dual-doped hierarchically porous carbon nanoreactors (N/O-HPCNs) derived from ZIF-8 via a facile one-step pyrolysis. The optimized catalyst achieves &#8764;90% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity over a wide potential range in 0.10&#160;M KOH.

         <title>Lewis Acid Adsorption Promotes CO2 Enrichment for Efficient Formic Acid Electrosynthesis on Reconstructed Bi2O2CO3 in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr&#8208;oxo node clusters in porphyrin coordination network were decorated on bismuth oxycarbonate as well&#8208;defined Lewis acid sites, enabling enhanced CO2 adsorption/activation and facilitated hydrogenation to form the *OCHO intermediate. This synergy boosts the electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction to formic acid in acidic electrolytes.








Abstract
In acidic media, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formic acid (HCOOH) represents a promising strategy for producing value&#8208;added chemicals. However, a critical challenge persists in enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation to suppress hydrogen evolution and boost product selectivity. Here, a Lewis acidic Zr&#8208;oxo cluster&#8208;rich porous confined structure decorated Bi2O2CO3 catalyst (Bi2O2CO3@PCN) is constructed via in situ electroreconstruction, which effectively promotes surface CO2 enrichment and K+ confinement in acidic conditions. Spatially adjacent Zr&#8208;oxo clusters enhance CO2 adsorption at the interface through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, facilitating the *OCHO intermediate formation. The optimized Bi2O2CO3@PCN catalyst achieves a high HCOOH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95% across a broad potential window and demonstrates a 5.9&#8208;fold higher mass activity compared to Bi2O2CO3 in acidic media at &#8210;1.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Notably, Bi2O2CO3@PCN exhibits superior HCOOH FE compared to Bi2O2CO3 under low&#8208;concentration CO2 flow. Mechanistically, the strong binding of CO2 molecules at Bi&#8211;O&#8211;Zr interfacial sites significantly lowers the hydrogenation barrier, while K+ enrichment repels protons and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work underscores the pivotal role of surface confinement and Lewis acidic sites in regulating interfacial microenvironments and CO2 adsorption, highlighting their potential for efficient conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2.

         <title>Caylobolide B: Structure Revision, Total Synthesis, Biological Characterization, and Discovery of New Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marine polyhydroxylated macrolides&#8217; drug discovery potential is limited by structural complexity and scarce material supply, hindering structure assignment, synthesis, and biological studies. Here, we present an integrated workflow that combines chemogenomic profiling, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution NMR&#8208;guided structural revision and stereochemical assignment, and modular total synthesis to enable comprehensive interrogation of the caylobolide B family.








Abstract
The unique potential of marine polyhydroxylated macrolides in chemical biology and drug discovery has long been constrained by their structural complexity and limited material availability, frustrating efforts in stereochemical assignment, synthesis, and mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action elucidation. Here, we establish an integrated workflow, combining chemogenomic profiling, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution NMR, and modular total synthesis, for the comprehensive functional and structural interrogation of this challenging natural product class. Applying this approach to caylobolides, natural products isolated from scarce samples of Okeania sp., we performed structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealing that acetylation at C29 markedly reduces both cytotoxicity and antifungal activity, pinpointing a key pharmacophore. Mechanistic profiling suggests that these macrolides disrupt membrane integrity, similar to amantelide A. Using natural compound samples, we simultaneously revised the structure of caylobolide B through 1H, 1D&#8208;selective TOCSY and HSQC NMR, and developed a modular fragment&#8208;based synthesis of these compounds. By providing a unified methodology for genetic sensitivity profiling, precise structure and stereochemistry determination, and modular total synthesis, this work unlocks new opportunities for the discovery and rational design of potent marine&#8208;derived therapeutics.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of X&#8208;Vinylbenziodoxol(on)es and One&#8208;Pot Conversion to Complex Alkenes**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a wide range of complex 1,2&#8208;di(heteroatom)&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;alkenes is achieved through a mechanochemical one&#8208;pot reaction of ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO) with a variety of heteroatom nucleophiles. The mechanochemical activation enables synthesis of a range of novel vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX/VBO) whose synthesis is inefficient under solution&#8208;phase. 








Abstract
Densely functionalized alkenes are often utilized as excellent tools for further functionalization of molecules. Recent progress in their synthesis includes nucleophilic addition to vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) and vinylbenziodoxoles (VBO) to reach alkenes with complete regio&#8208; and stereocontrol. In this work, we leverage the inherent properties of mechanochemistry to enable an efficient transition metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot route to 1,2&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;alkenes directly from ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO), avoiding the isolation of VBX/VBO. We demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding synthesis of a large variety of N/O/S&#8208;VBX reagents, which, combined with a telescoped nucleophilic addition, delivers a wide range of novel, complex (Z)&#8208;alkenes. This one&#8208;pot strategy would be challenging to develop in solution due to a mismatch in reaction solvents, and the unique mechanochemical activation offered by solventless, solid&#8208;state mixing also enables formation of products whose synthesis is inefficient with solvent&#8208;based methods.

         <title>Enantioselective Syntheses of Secondary Alkylboronates via Asymmetric Regioselective Reduction of 1,3&#8208;Dienylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein the development of catalytic asymmetric synthesis of secondary alkyl boronates. Under the optimal conditions, Cu&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes forms secondary alkyl boronates with excellent regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. With H2O as the source of hydrogen, the reaction proceeds through a protoboration and protodeboration cascade reaction sequence to generate the desired boronates. By using a slightly modified protocol, the process allows for access to enantioenriched deuterium&#8208;labeled secondary alkyl boronates.

With H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as the source of hydrogen, the reaction proceeds through a protoboration and protodeboration cascade reaction sequence to generate the desired boronates. By using a slightly modified protocol, the process allows for access to enantioenriched deuterium-labeled secondary alkylboronates. Density functional theory (DFT) studies were conducted to probe the origins of selectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Orchestrated Oxygen Motifs Decouple Ion Dissociation/Migration in Liquid Crystal Elastomer for High&#8208; Performance Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially orchestrated oxygen coordination within a multi&#8208;crosslinked liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;elastomer (LCE) electrolyte enables a cooperative &#8220;anchor&#8211;relay&#8221; mechanism for Li+ transport. Carbonyl oxygens act as stationary anchors for Li&#8208;salt dissociation, while ether oxygens function as dynamic relays for rapid ion hopping through ordered mesophases. This programmable coordination network achieves high ionic conductivity (4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1), a Li+ transference number of 0.78, and dendrite&#8208;free cycling. 








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) emerge as prime candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, capitalizing on their intrinsic electrochemical robustness and enhanced safety profiles. However, overcoming the inherent trade&#8208;off between efficient lithium&#8208;salt dissociation and rapid ion migration remains a fundamental challenge for SPEs. We propose a programmable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) framework with spatially patterned carbonyl (&#9472;C&#9552;O) and ether (&#9472;C&#9472;O&#9472;C&#9472;) oxygen motifs. In this hierarchical architecture, carbonyl groups act as stationary anchors to dissociate LiTFSI via strong coordination, while ether chains serve as dynamic relays enabling barrier&#8208;reduced Li&#8314; hopping along oriented mesophases. This decoupled &#8220;anchor&#8208;relay&#8221; mechanism achieves outstanding room&#8208;temperature performance: ionic conductivity of 4.05&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and Li&#8314; transference number of 0.78. The synergistically induced LiF&#8208;rich interphase further suppresses dendrite growth, the symmetric Li//Li cell exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan over 1000&#160;h with a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV, delivering exceptional cycling stability in both LiFePO4//Li cell (90.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles) and high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2//Li cell systems. The proposed LCEs as a transformative platform for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries through rational molecular engineering.

         <title>Physicochemically Informed Axial Chirality Descriptors Enable Accurate Prediction of Atropisomeric Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning model for atropisomers&#8217; stability is developed. By integrating a physicochemically&#8208;informed axial chirality structure descriptor (ACSD) with a graph attention network (GAT), the model accurately predicts rotational barriers. Its robustness is validated on complex drugs and molecular switches, providing a powerful tool for rational catalyst and drug design.








Abstract
Atropisomers play a vital role in asymmetric synthesis, drug discovery, and the development of functional materials. However, the rational design of atropisomers is challenging due to the difficulty in predicting their configurational stability, which depends on the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8225;). Here, we introduce ACSD&#8208;GAT, a deep learning framework that addresses this issue. Our approach comprises a newly curated benchmark dataset of 1015 experimentally measured rotational barrier, along with a physicochemically informed axial chirality structure descriptor (ACSD) that explicitly quantifies both static and dynamic steric repulsion during rotation. By integrating the ACSD with a graph attention network (GAT), our model accurately predicts the rotational barrier, achieving an R2 of 0.91 and a RMSE of 2.02&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 on test datasets. The robustness and real&#8208;world applicability of the model are also demonstrated through rigorous validation with complex pharmaceuticals, molecular switches, and newly synthesized atropisomers.

         <title>Unlocking Selective Electrochemical Regulation via Interlayer Anion Competition for Nitrate Extraction from Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering structural compatibility between 2D bismuth&#8208;based materials and planar nitrate ions, we developed [Bi2O2]2+ layered electrodes for selective NO3&#8722; capture. A controlled carbonate ion (CO32&#8722;) doping strategy was employed to modulate interlayer bonding energies through metal&#8208;affinity coordination, enhancing NO3&#8722;&#8208;specific adsorption while repelling competing anions. This enables a high NO3&#8722; removal capacity of 182.47&#160;mg g&#8722;1 and a remarkable 90.78% NO3&#8722; removal efficiency in complex ionic systems.








Abstract
Electrochemical separation technology offers an effective approach to recycle valuable nitrogen from industrial wastewater, but its separation efficiency is reduced by competitive electrostatic interactions from multiple ions. By engineering a competitive chemical reaction to facilitate site&#8208;specific electrochemical binding of NO3&#8722;, this approach offers a promising route for high&#8208;efficiency anion separation in complex solutions. Herein, a novel [Bi2O2]2+ layered Faraday electrode was designed with two&#8208;dimensional channels for NO3&#8722; migration and multiple sites that boost its interaction through combined electrostatic and coordination forces. In addition, by strategically introducing exogenous anions, the induced antisite cation defects at Bi3+ sites enhance the coordination of subsequent NO3&#8722; insertion, achieving a NO3&#8722; removal capacity of 182.47&#160;mg g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the highly charged CO32&#8722; enhances its repulsion against other competitive anions, leading to an impressive removal ratio of 90.78% for NO3&#8722; in multi&#8208;ion solutions. More importantly, exogenous CO32&#8722; intercalation reverses the interlayer binding energy hierarchy between NO3&#8722; and SO42&#8722;, converting the substitution by NO3&#8722; (&#8722;13.12&#160;eV) more thermodynamically favorable than that by SO42&#8722; (&#8722;12.16&#160;eV), enabling spontaneous NO3&#8722; uptake. Our work provides new insights for designing NO3&#8722;&#8208;selective electrodes, enhancing understanding of anion&#8208;interface interactions.

         <title>Creep Resistant and Reprocessable Polyamide Networks Based on Reversible Lactone Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the reversible ring&#8208;opening reaction of &#947;&#8208;lactones with primary amines was used to obtain dynamic covalent polyamide networks combining excellent reprocessability and creep resistance. This behavior was facilitated by neighboring group participation of the mildly nucleophilic &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl moiety present after amide formation.








Abstract
Amides are robust chemical linkages of interest in the field of dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPNs), but their activation towards dynamic exchange remains an outstanding challenge. Herein, we introduce &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amides as a versatile motif for the design of creep resistant, yet fully reprocessable crosslinked polyamide&#8208;based materials. This was achieved by the reversible ring&#8208;opening of &#947;&#8208;lactones with primary amines. Small molecule kinetic studies showed that temperatures exceeding 120&#160;&#176;C are required for the ring&#8208;closure to occur at a significant rate. Thus, efficient exchange of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amide bonds was expected upon heating, while essentially non&#8208;dynamic covalent amide bonds should prevail at lower temperatures. &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy amides were then introduced into DCPNs, for which a newly prepared bifunctional &#947;&#8208;lactone monomer was cured with amine hardeners. A marked thermal response was observed in the rheological behavior, while creep resistance comparable to that of a non&#8208;dynamic epoxy&#8208;amine network was maintained up to 120&#160;&#176;C. Finally, we could also demonstrate the thermal resilience of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amides after multiple compression molding cycles for a material with a glass transition temperature above 80&#160;&#176;C. Consequently, we expect that this simple chemistry platform has high potential for application in reprocessable thermoset materials.

Thus, efficient exchange of the &#947;-hydroxy amide bonds was expected upon heating, while essentially non-dynamic covalent amide bonds should prevail at lower temperatures. &#947;-Hydroxy amides were then introduced into DCPNs, for which a newly prepared bifunctional &#947;-lactone monomer was cured with amine hardeners. A marked thermal response was observed in the rheological behavior, while creep resistance comparable to that of a non-dynamic epoxy-amine network was maintained up to 120&#160;&#176;C. Finally, we could also demonstrate the thermal resilience of &#947;-hydroxy amides after multiple compression molding cycles for a material with a glass transition temperature above 80&#160;&#176;C. Consequently, we expect that this simple chemistry platform has high potential for application in reprocessable thermoset materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

RETRACTION: T. Yu, X. Liu, A.&#8208;L. Bolcato&#8208;Bellemin, Y. Wang, C. Liu, P. Erbacher, F. Qu, P. Rocchi, J.&#8208;P. Behr, and L. Peng, &#8220;An Amphiphilic Dendrimer for Effective Delivery of Small Interfering RNA and Gene Silencing In&#8197;Vitro and In&#8197;Vivo,&#8221; Angewandte Chemie International Edition 51, no. 34 (2012): 8478&#8208;8484. https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201203920.
The above article, published online on 24 July 2012 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the journal Editors&#8208;in&#8208;Chief, Frank Maass and Nathalie Weickgenannt; the German Chemical Society; and Wiley&#8208;VCH GmbH. A third party reported that Figure 1C contained duplicated bands, that the Naked siRNA bands in Figure 2D had been manipulated to remove data containing bands from the 0&#8208;120 (min) lanes. These concerns were confirmed by the publisher.
The authors responded to an inquiry by the publisher and stated that the bands in Figure 1C were original but agreed that Figure 2D was incorrect. The authors confirmed that all original data were no longer available, supplied data of repeated experiments for Figure 2D, and stated their intention to supply data from repeated experiments for Figure 1C. Both the editors and publisher agree that a correction with data from repeated experiments would not be appropriate.
The retraction has been agreed to because the evidence of image manipulation in Figures 1C and 2D fundamentally compromises the editor's confidence in the conclusions presented in the article. The authors were informed of the retraction.

EGFP linked to a click&#8208;cyclized cell penetrating peptide that attach itself to the cell membrane and internalize into the cell, while carrying the EGFP as a cargo. The best CPP was selected from a designed library of linear and click cyclized D&#8208;peptides having four arginines and a naphthyl group. As indicated by membrane curvature the cell penetration occurs by a dynamin dependent endocytosis mechanism. The cells were healthy at all concentrations investigated indicating low or no toxicity.

         <title>Frontispiece: Carbonothioate&#8208;Triggered Cascade Cyclization Enables High&#8208;Specificity Fluorescence Imaging of Hydrogen Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonothioate&#8208;based fluorescent probe is developed that can be selectively activated by H2Sn (n&#160;&gt;&#160;1) through cascade cyclization reaction to liberate the phenolic fluorophore. This work for the first time demonstrates the fluorescence imaging of H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Details are reported by Wei Chen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202519021).

Achieving specific interactions of metal&#8208;oxo clusters with biological substrates becomes possible through organic functionalization. The illustration depicts a dartboard that symbolizes the enzyme's active site as the molecular target. The darts represent clusters bearing distinct organic functionalities, designed to enable selective interactions with the protein surface. This concept highlights the potential of molecular design strategies to achieve precise bioinorganic recognition. More in the Communication (e202518349) by Mhamad Aly Moussawi, Tatjana N.

Local electric fields guide protons toward the heme through two distinct electrostatic funnels at the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges in heme peroxidases. Water&#8208;mediated pathways enable proton exchange with key residues such as Arg38 and His42. These findings reveal that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple, well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery, conserved across heme peroxidase enzymes.

Calcium metal nanoparticles (5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm) are realized by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2&#160;with [LiNaph] in toluene. Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5&#160;with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9&#160;cluster core of zerovalent gold.

Mechanical activation in ball&#8208;milling mechanochemistry remains experimentally elusive, prompting the theoretical exploration in the Research Article (e202505263) by Ivan Halasz, Ana&#8208;Sun&#269;ana Smith, and co&#8208;workers. Using molecular simulations, mechanochemical impacts under neat and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding are modelled, capturing how kinetic energy from the impact drives crystal fragmentation into atoms, ions, and ion pairs, triggering product formation and agglomeration. It is shown that minimal liquid promotes reactivity, while excess stabilizes reactants. This framework enables rational optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions.

         <title>Organic Polymer Semiconductor Photocatalysts: From Building Block Design to Controllable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polymer semiconductors are highly tunable photocatalytic systems. This review explores the structural design of organic polymer semiconductors from two perspectives: building block design and control over self&#8208;assembly and surface modification. Furthermore, the future development of organic polymer semiconductor photocatalysts is discussed. By integrating structural design with photocatalytic reactions, this review provides a foundation for the rational design of photocatalytic organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic polymer semiconductors are emerging as a promising class of photocatalysts because their highly tunable molecular structures and flexible morphological control offer unique advantages for overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks of traditional inorganic materials. However, the development of organic polymer photocatalysts largely relies on empirical, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches. The understanding of their structure&#8211;activity relationship is insufficient, which significantly hinders the rational design and performance prediction of polymer photocatalysts. This review systematically outlines the structure&#8208;driven design strategies for polymer photocatalysts by focusing on two interconnected levels: molecular building block design and controllable assembly. Starting with the molecular building block design, strategies including monomer unit selection, functional group modification, and heteroatom doping are analyzed in detail for tuning the material's intrinsic electronic and photophysical properties. At the assembly level, we explore how strategies like morphological control, surface modification, and pore engineering can guide the controlled organization of polymers to optimize the final semiconductor architecture. By establishing the relationship between structure and properties at different scales, we aim to build a systematic structure&#8211;activity relationship for polymer photocatalysts, ultimately seeking to shift from empirical screening to rational design.

         <title>Recent Advances in Regulating Metal&#8722;Silica Interaction for Boosting Heterogeneous Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discussed the recent developments in the construction of the metal&#8211;silica interface, and important catalytic applications in heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are extensively utilized in the modern chemical industry, with catalytic processes primarily occurring on the surfaces of nanocrystals. Construction of an optimum surface/interface is of significant importance in regulating the catalytic performance. Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have been proven to be an efficient strategy to modulate the electronic and geometric properties of the supported nanocrystals by forming a thin amorphous coating layer and a new metal bond. The classical SMSI typically occurred on reducible metal oxides (TiO2, CeO2, Nb2O5, and Fe2O3) under a reduction environment. Nevertheless, the SMSI effect could be successfully engineered for the inert oxides (Al2O3, MgO, and SiO2) under much more severe conditions owing to the inertness of hard&#8208;to&#8208;reduce oxides compared with reducible oxides. Over the past few decades, it has been observed that the amorphous encapsulation layer could be induced under much higher temperatures, as well as the formation of a metal&#8211;Si bond, which significantly promotes various catalysis. In this review, we focus on the construction of metal&#8211;silica interaction and the dynamics of structure evolution of the metal crystals under certain reaction conditions, while highlighting their unique features in heterogeneous catalytic processes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Sulfur&#8208;Dots Induced Spatiotemporal PhotoRDRP for Multi&#8208;Arm Star Functional Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoRDRP for functional polymers: Metal&#8208;free sulfur&#8208;dots (S&#8208;dots) mediated photoinduced reversible deactivation radical polymerization (photoRDRP) strategy is developed for the production of well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;arm star copolymers with dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. The resulting smart polymers exhibited precise architecture control and self&#8208;assembly behavior.








Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;dots (S&#8208;dots) serve as a cost&#8208;effective and non&#8208;toxic alternative to traditional photocatalysts or transition metals typically required in photoinduced reversible deactivation radical polymerization (photoRDRP). Herein, we report a facile and efficient method for synthesizing well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;arm star polymers through S&#8208;dots mediated photoRDRP under ambient conditions. This approach enables precise control over polymer growth with excellent spatiotemporal control over polymerization, as evidenced by the ability to pause and resume polymerization with UVA light (&#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching). This methodology was successfully applied to produce a variety of polymer architectures, including multi&#8208;arm star homopolymers and dual&#8208;responsive diblock and triblock copolymers. Among these, the synthesized 4&#8208;arm star [poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(butyl acrylate)]4&#8208;Br [4&#8208;arm star (PDMA&#8208;b&#8208;PDMAEMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBA)4&#8208;Br] triblock copolymer was used to assess pH and temperature responsiveness. This work introduces a sustainable, metal&#8208;free route for the development of next&#8208;generation smart polymers suitable for biomedical and environmental applications and highlights the versatility of S&#8208;dots as a catalyst.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Acidity Interplay in Eu&#8208;Promoted PtSn2 Catalysts for Selective and Stable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

Eu&#8208;promoted PtSn2 catalysts leverage the redox activity of Eu and tailored acidity to reduce coke formation, enhancing selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. This synergy significantly improves propylene yield and extends catalyst lifespan, providing an effective strategy for efficient PDH processes.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on Pt alloys are widely employed in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), yet challenges such as coking and poor nanoparticle stability hinder their broader industrial deployment. Strategies to enhance dispersion and tune the catalyst surface properties remain at the forefront of catalyst design. Here, we demonstrate a new class of PtSn2&#8208;based catalysts promoted by rare&#8208;earth elements for efficient and stable PDH. Among the rare&#8208;earth screened, europium (Eu) delivers the most pronounced promotional effect, enabling the formation of &#8764;1.3&#160;nm PtSn2 nanoparticles with improved thermal stability. Through its redox flexibility (Eu3+/Eu2+), Eu modulates the electronic environment of Pt, tunes surface acidity, and suppresses coke accumulation by directing carbon species away from active sites and onto the support. This work shows that rare&#8208;earth elements can serve as multifunctional promoters in alloy catalysts, influencing both structural dispersion and catalytic surface chemistry. The optimized catalyst (0.5% Pt&#8208;3% Sn&#8208;2% Eu on &#947;&#8208;Al2O3) achieves a 40.6% propylene yield at 575&#160;&#176;C and a low deactivation rate (0.047&#160;h&#8722;1), under conditions relevant to industrial practice. Our findings offer a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance diluted alloy catalysts through rare&#8208;earth promotion, applicable to other dehydrogenation and hydrocarbon upgrading reactions where coke suppression and acid&#8211;base balance are critical.

         <title>Solubility, Speciation and Thermodynamics of PuCO3OH(cr) in Carbonate Containing NaCl Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline Pu(III) hydroxo carbonate, PuCO3OH(cr), was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions, and structurally characterized by Rietveld analysis and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Solubility experiments revealed a great thermodynamic stability of PuCO3OH(cr), that substantially enhances the predominance field of solid Pu(III).








Abstract
The solubility, aqueous speciation, and solid phase formation of trivalent plutonium, Pu(III) was investigated for the first time in pH near&#8208;neutral 0.10&#160;M NaCl solutions under the presence of carbonate at T&#160;=&#160;(23&#160;&#177;&#160;2)&#160;&#176;C in the frame of a comprehensive experimental study. Crystalline PuCO3OH(cr) was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of the binary hydroxide Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions and comprehensively characterized by VIS/NIR absorption spectroscopy, SEM/EDX, powder XRD and Rietveld analysis, and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Batch solubility experiments with PuCO3OH(cr) equilibrated in 0.10&#160;M NaCl&#8211;Na2CO3 solutions were performed from undersaturation as a function of pHm and followed over time for up to 90 days. A chemical model was derived and the corresponding thermodynamic constants evaluated. These novel data demonstrate that under specific conditions Pu(III) equilibrium concentrations are up to three orders of magnitude lower when controlled by the PuCO3OH(cr) compared to the concentration level defined by Pu(OH)3(am), and reveal a remarkable stabilization of the entire Pu(III) oxidation state in carbonate containing aqueous solutions. The relevance of the new data for geochemical modeling of environmental systems and nuclear waste repositories is discussed.

         <title>Solvent Channels and Electric Fields Guide Proton Delivery to the Active Site of Heme Peroxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic potential surfaces and electric field lines reveal that local fields guide proton delivery through multiple conserved solvent channels in heme peroxidases, enabling efficient access to the active site.








Abstract
The active sites of heme enzymes have evolved to control the formation of highly reactive intermediates in oxidative catalysis. Proton delivery to the heme is essential, yet the mechanisms of proton delivery remain poorly understood. Here, we identify routes and drivers of proton delivery in a heme peroxidase (ascorbate peroxidase) using computational approaches that combine classical, quantum, and hybrid methods with enhanced sampling and local electric field (LEF) analyses. Our results show that networks of active&#8208;site water molecules facilitate proton exchange with Arg38, which may act as a transient proton carrier at the &#947;&#8208;heme edge where the substrate binds. The distal His42 residue aids proton transfer into the active site via solvent at the &#948;&#8208;edge. Molecular dynamics simulations of three heme peroxidases identify hydrated channels leading to both &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, allowing solvent protons to reach the active site. Comparison with eight other heme peroxidases shows that these channels are conserved. LEF analyses reveal a continuous electrostatic funnel drawing protons toward the heme from the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, a feature that is broadly conserved across other peroxidases. These results suggest that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery in peroxidase catalysis.

         <title>Development of High Performance Pyrolized Polyimide&#8208;based Carbon Molecular Sieves for Enhanced Selectivity of Propylene/Propane Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report extremely selective carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) pyrolized from a triptycence&#8208;based intrinsically microporous polyimide: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride&#8208;2,6(7)&#8208;diamino triptycene (6FDA&#8208;DAT1). A fresh CMS membrane pyrolyzed at 800 &#176;C for 2&#160;h displayed a mixed&#8208;gas C3H6 permeability of 56 Barrer combined with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 66. A remarkable increase in mixed&#8208;gas C3H6/C3H8 selectivity up to 152 was observed after 147 days of continuous mixed&#8208;gas testing at 4&#160;bar.








Abstract
The replacement or de&#8208;bottlenecking of the highly energy&#8208;intensive distillation unit operation process for propylene/propane separation has long posed a formidable challenge. Although membrane technology can potentially offer a more energy&#8208;efficient alternative, existing materials lack the requisite mixed&#8208;gas selectivity for industrial use. Achieving effective separation for propylene and propane with only 0.13&#197; difference in molecular size requires membranes with superb molecular sieving properties. Here, we report extremely selective carbon molecular sieve (CMS) materials fabricated by utilizing a triptycene&#8208;based intrinsically microporous 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride&#8208;2,6(7)&#8208;diamino triptycene (6FDA&#8208;DAT1) polyimide precursor and adjusting its microstructure through finely tuned high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. A freshly prepared isotropic CMS membrane pyrolyzed at 800 &#176;C for 2&#160;h displayed a mixed&#8208;gas propylene permeability of 56 Barrer combined with a C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 66. Notably, after an extended period of continuous mixed&#8208;gas testing and aging at 4&#160;bar over 147 days, the CMS membrane exhibited a remarkable increase in mixed&#8208;gas propylene/propane selectivity to 152&#8212;an unmatched value to date for a CMS material&#8212;because of selective tightening of the CMS microstructure by physical aging.

Winning by losing: With rational elimination of crystal lattice contacts, the remaining interaction sites drive the formation of predetermined assemblies. Thus, rational lattice redesign can produce multiple structured frameworks from essentially the same building blocks, without resource&#8208;costly calculations required for new designs.








Abstract
Ordered protein&#8208;based assemblies are increasingly desirable for materials science, but the design of new materials remains challenging and requires considerable effort. Crystal lattice contact modulation enables rapid rational design of an assortment of structurally diverse constructs with crystalline order. Targeted disruption of crystal contacts and directional growth pre&#8208;biasing allows for restricting crystal lattice growth in selected directions, resulting in lower&#8208;dimension assemblies with parent crystal structural features. Two&#8208;dimensional crystals, one&#8208;dimensional fibres, flexible ribbons, and single&#8208;walled nanotubes based on tetratricopeptide repeat proteins were constructed from reengineered 3D crystal lattices. The large library of available crystal structures provides an abundance of engineering targets, promising to make crystal contact engineering a rapid and attractive approach for the design of ordered supramolecular protein assemblies.

         <title>Controlled Dual Activation of Rhenium(I) Photosensitizers and Profluorophores/Prodrugs via a Dissociative Bioorthogonal Tetrazine&#8211;Isonitrile Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhenium(I) tetrazylmethyl complexes serve as phosphorogenic bioorthogonal reagents, releasing luminescent and photocytotoxic rhenium(I) 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes and functional payloads upon reaction with 3&#8208;isocyanopropyl derivatives. Their selective lysosomal accumulation in cancer cells and enhanced singlet oxygen photosensitization in acidic environments highlight their potential for bioimaging and combination therapy in tumors.








Abstract
Strategies for prodrug activation have been developed to enhance treatment efficacy, with bioorthogonal dissociation reactions emerging as a promising approach due to their remarkable specificity. In this work, we designed three rhenium(I) polypyridine complexes featuring a tetrazylmethyl (TzMe) group capable of bioorthogonal activation by 3&#8208;isocyanopropyl (ICPr) or 3&#8208;isocyanopropyl&#8208;1&#8208;carbamoyl (ICPrc) derivatives. This design serves as a dual&#8208;release platform, which liberates rhenium(I) 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes and functional payloads from rhenium(I) TzMe complexes and ICPr/ICPrc&#8208;caged compounds, respectively. Upon incubation with an ICPrc derivative, the TzMe complexes exhibited strong emission in acidic buffers, attributed to the predominant existence of the resulting rhenium(I) 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes in their protonated form. Confocal imaging of live cells incubated with a TzMe complex and ICPr&#8208;caged fluorescein unveiled intense intracellular emission in distinct channels. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of this approach was underscored by the treatment of cells with a TzMe complex and ICPrc&#8208;caged doxorubicin. The anticancer effect was amplified through the synergy between singlet oxygen (1O2) photosensitization and prodrug activation, effectively combining photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy. The more pronounced 1O2 generation of the 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes in acidic media and their specific accumulation within the acidic lysosomes of cancer cells highlight the potential of bioorthogonal prodrug activation for effective cancer&#8208;targeted therapy.

         <title>Enzyme Immobilization in Porous Crystals via Cage Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins have been immobilized in crystals by encapsulation in well&#8208;defined, spherical coordination cages prior to crystallization. This pre&#8208;encapsulation approach allows isomorphic crystallization of various types of proteins with high loading efficiency. Dual enzyme immobilization in the cage crystals resulted in enhanced cascade reaction activity due to close proximity.








Abstract
Enzyme immobilization within solid or polymer matrices continues to face challenges, such as inhomogeneous protein environments, low loading efficiency, and limited versatility. Here, we present a pre&#8208;encapsulation strategy for enzyme immobilization in porous crystals via coordination cage encapsulation. In this approach, enzymes are first confined within the well&#8208;defined cavities of spherical coordination cages prior to crystallization. The host cage framework facilitates crystal formation under almost uniform conditions, independently of the surface properties of the enzymes. This isomorphous crystallization enabled the successful immobilization of nine proteins with diverse sizes and properties, achieving high loading efficiencies. The immobilized enzymes retained their native structures and catalytic activities within the crystal, functioning as heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced stability. Furthermore, the co&#8208;immobilization of two enzymes in close proximity facilitated cascade reactions, underscoring the potential of coordination cages as effective hosts for enzyme immobilization.

         <title>Two&#8208;Stage Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide Into Aromatics Via Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a two&#8208;stage process for converting CO2 via CH4 to C6H6 using a Ni/TiO2 catalyst in stage 1 and a Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst stage 2. Thermodynamic calculations as well as experimentally varying parameters, aided in finding the optimal reaction conditions and reducing the coke deposition in stage 2. Furthermore, operando spectroscopy was employed to understand the increased catalyst stability in stage 2.








Abstract
In the refinery of the future, the input shifts from crude oil to biomass, plastic, and CO2. Therefore, we need to find alternative routes to produce chemical building blocks, such as aromatics, which are used in products like, for example, fuels. In this study, we investigated a two&#8208;stage route to produce benzene from CO2. In two sequential reactions, CO2 is first converted into methane over a Ni/TiO2 catalyst, and methane is further reacted to yield benzene using a Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst via the methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) reaction. Through a combination of thermodynamic calculations and experiments, we found the goldilocks conditions for performing this two&#8208;stage process. The unreacted CO2 and H2 from the first reaction extended the benzene production in the second reaction. Using a reaction mixture of CO2, H2, and CH4 resulted in benzene production of at least 72&#160;h, by suppressing carbon growth on the catalyst surface. However, the concentration range in which CO2 and H2 can be added to the feed without losing benzene production is narrow, as we show with H2 fluctuation experiments. We demonstrate that the combination of CO2 methanation and MDA allows us to catalytically convert CO2 into benzene with an overall yield of 5%.

         <title>Exploring a New Family of (Phosphinochalcogenoyl)Europocenes for Magneto&#8208;Optical Thermometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand featuring a coordinating phosphinothioyl, &#8208;selenoyl, or &#8208;telluroyl pendant arm in addition to the typical &#951;5&#8208;mode is presented. The homoleptic divalent europocenes obtained from these are the first examples of organometallic probes for magnetic circular dichroism thermometry at cryogenic temperatures, attaining relative sensitivities of up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.7&#160;K with resolution as high as 0.003&#160;K.








Abstract
The development of novel materials based on lanthanide metallocenes remains a valuable endeavour, due to the synthetic accessibility, compositional tunability, and impressive magnetic and luminescent properties of this class of well&#8208;studied compounds. Europium(II) complexes are particularly interesting in this regard, given the relative stability, strong paramagnetism, and characteristic Laporte&#8208;allowed 5d&#8594;4f emission of this ion. In this study, we tap into the powerful class of phosphinocyclopentadienyl ligands to develop a novel family of potassium (bis(dimethylamino)phosphinochalcogenoyl)cyclopentadienides K[C5Me4(PCh(NMe2)2] of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, and explore their coordination chemistry with EuII. These ligands readily form homoleptic europocenes where the pendant phosphine chalcogenide arms also coordinate the europium center, and these are characterized via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorbance, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Characterization via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy reveals that these complexes act as extremely sensitive probes for MCD&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry, reaching relative thermal sensitivities up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&#8722;1 at cryogenic temperatures, with temperature uncertainties as low as 0.003&#160;K. These complexes represent the first examples of organometallic MCD thermometers, and their remarkable properties and interesting structures highlight the promise of this new class of ligands and the utility of the EuII ion in lanthanide&#8208;based functional materials research.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand featuring a coordinating phosphinothioyl, -selenoyl, or -telluroyl pendant arm in addition to the typical &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-mode is presented. The homoleptic divalent europocenes obtained from these are the first examples of organometallic probes for magnetic circular dichroism thermometry at cryogenic temperatures, attaining relative sensitivities of up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.7&#160;K with resolution as high as 0.003&#160;K.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of novel materials based on lanthanide metallocenes remains a valuable endeavour, due to the synthetic accessibility, compositional tunability, and impressive magnetic and luminescent properties of this class of well-studied compounds. Europium(II) complexes are particularly interesting in this regard, given the relative stability, strong paramagnetism, and characteristic Laporte-allowed 5d&#8594;4f emission of this ion. In this study, we tap into the powerful class of phosphinocyclopentadienyl ligands to develop a novel family of potassium (bis(dimethylamino)phosphinochalcogenoyl)cyclopentadienides K[C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PCh(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, and explore their coordination chemistry with Eu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. These ligands readily form homoleptic europocenes where the pendant phosphine chalcogenide arms also coordinate the europium center, and these are characterized via single-crystal X-ray diffraction, absorbance, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Characterization via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy reveals that these complexes act as extremely sensitive probes for MCD-based magneto-optical thermometry, reaching relative thermal sensitivities up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at cryogenic temperatures, with temperature uncertainties as low as 0.003&#160;K. These complexes represent the first examples of organometallic MCD thermometers, and their remarkable properties and interesting structures highlight the promise of this new class of ligands and the utility of the Eu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion in lanthanide-based functional materials research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ATP&#8208;Powered Signaling Between Artificial and Living Cells</title>

We introduce an ATP&#8208;powered artificial cell platform capable of selectively and transiently releasing DNA signals to facilitate communication between artificial and living cells. By engineering these DNA signals, we achieve precise activation of cellular functions and regulated delivery in response to ATP levels.








Abstract
ATP is the energy currency of life and is overabundant in the tumor microenvironment, where it has been suggested as a target for cancer therapy. We introduce ATP&#8208;dissipative delivery of DNA signals from artificial cells to living cells by exploiting an ATP&#8208;driven reaction network that transiently ejects DNA Signal strands from the shielded artificial cell interior to the extracellular medium of living cells. We customize the Signal for intracellular uptake or for extracellular instruction using a cytokine&#8208;ssDNA chimera that can trigger efficient intracellular downstream signaling programs. Our study discusses details of system design on a timer circuit and artificial cell level, system integration challenges, and how ATP concentrations regulate the transient delivery. The strategy can be extended to deliver therapeutic oligonucleotides for applications in gene therapy and gene silencing. For cancer therapy, it can use naturally enhanced ATP levels to induce selective delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides.

         <title>Difluorinative Cyclopropene Rearrangement by I(I)/I(III) Catalysis: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Allyl Difluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A difluorinative rearrangement of substituted cyclopropenes is disclosed using I(I)/I(III) catalysis. This platform enables di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl difluorides to be generated with high levels of stereoselectivity, with the I(III) center serving as a traceless directing group. X&#8208;ray crystal structural analysis is described together with facile post&#8208;reaction modifications that include expedient access to fluorinated indenes.








Abstract
Allyl difluorides are pervasive in the pharmaceutical arena, but synthetic challenges in the construction of highly substituted derivatives impede chemical space exploration. Consequently, efforts to develop general approaches that display high levels of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity continue to be intensively pursued. To contribute to this vibrant area of contemporary organofluorine chemistry, a highly efficient difluorinative rearrangement of densely substituted cyclopropenes is disclosed under the auspices of I(I)/I(III) catalysis. This platform leverages a highly intuitive ring opening model that enables di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl difluorides to be generated with high levels of stereoselectivity where the transient I(III) center serves as a traceless directing group. X&#8208;ray crystal structural analysis is described together with facile post&#8208;reaction modifications that include expedient access to fluorinated indenes. Given the ubiquity of the allyl difluoride chemotype in drug discovery, it is envisaged that this operationally simple, organocatalytic platform will expedite bioisostere design.

         <title>A Modular Approach to Asymmetric Mg(I) Complexes Using a Unique Cyclopentadienyl Mg(I) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like changing the tire of a car: The synthesis of a unique MgI complex with a Cp* ligand enabled facile ligand exchange by salt metathesis, giving access to a first aryloxide&#8208;stabilized MgI complex. This concept paves the way for the syntheses of a large variety of asymmetric MgI dimers in which one of the MgI centres is stabilized by a non&#8208;nitrogen ligand.








Abstract
The first MgI complexes with non&#8208;N ligands have been isolated and were fully characterized. Reaction of [(BDI*)MgNa]2 (III) with MgCp*2 gave quantitative conversion to (BDI*)MgMgCp* (1); BDI* = HC[tBuC&#160;=&#160;N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl) and Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl. A similar reaction with CaCp*2 did not give (BDI*)MgCaCp* but led to insertion of the formal Mg&#176; centre in the benzylic C&#9472;H bond, an oxidative addition that resulted in a mixed Mg/Ca hydride complex. The Cp* ligand in the unique (BDI*)MgMgCp* complex can be exchanged by addition of LM (M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K) complexes, resulting in formation of (BDI*)MgMgL and insoluble (Cp*M)n. This modular approach worked for Cp*/N(SiMe3)2 exchange but not for the substitution of Cp* by P(SiMe3)2 or other PR2 ligands. Reaction of (BDI*)MgMgCp* with a bulky NaOAr reagent led to quantitative formation of (BDI*)MgMgOAr&#183;THF, a first MgI complex stabilized with an aryloxide ligand. All products have been fully characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR methods. A computational study gives insight in the thermodynamics of formation and electronic structures.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Directed Assembly of Robust Coordination Cages: Overcoming Kinetic Inertness and Conformational Mismatch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

Polyoxometalate (POM) templates unlock the selective self&#8208;assembly of robust coordination cages from inert metal centers and conformationally mismatched ligands. This strategy modulates both thermodynamic and kinetic pathways, affording stable hosts capable of guest binding under acidic and basic aqueous conditions.








Abstract
The selective construction of kinetically robust coordination cages by self&#8208;assembly remains a significant challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the selective assembly of robust Pt6L4 cages under thermodynamic or kinetic control, which is inaccessible via untemplated methods. For a planar ligand (L1) with a dihedral angle (&#952; = 0&#176;), the POM template promotes the formation of a thermodynamically favored Pt6(L1)4 analog. Remarkably, for a twisted and flexible ligand (L2) with a nonideal dihedral angle (&#952; &#8776; 36&#176;), which typically favors the thermodynamically preferred M12L8 cages, the POM template induces the formation of the kinetically trapped M6L4 cages even when using inert Pt(II) precursors. In the absence of POMs, such structures cannot form due to conformational mismatch and the kinetic inertness of metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The resulting Pt(II)&#8208;based cages are highly stable and remain intact as discrete, template&#8208;free hosts after POM removal, capable of encapsulating diverse guests in both acidic and basic aqueous media. This work highlights the unique templating role of POMs in accessing both thermodynamic and kinetic architectures, offering new opportunities for designing robust cages for drug delivery, sensing, and catalysis under harsh conditions.

Remarkably, for a twisted and flexible ligand (&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;) with a nonideal dihedral angle (&#952; &#8776; 36&#176;), which typically favors the thermodynamically preferred M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cages, the POM template induces the formation of the kinetically trapped M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cages even when using inert Pt(II) precursors. In the absence of POMs, such structures cannot form due to conformational mismatch and the kinetic inertness of metal-ligand coordination. The resulting Pt(II)-based cages are highly stable and remain intact as discrete, template-free hosts after POM removal, capable of encapsulating diverse guests in both acidic and basic aqueous media. This work highlights the unique templating role of POMs in accessing both thermodynamic and kinetic architectures, offering new opportunities for designing robust cages for drug delivery, sensing, and catalysis under harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted DOTAs as Superior and Universal Platforms for Multifunctional Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step multi&#8208;component synthetic approach is reported to construct &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs, which required tedious multi&#8208;step synthesis in all previous works. The synthesized &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs showed improved performance for developing multifunctional theranostics and represent a universal platform for bioconjugation. 








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Substituted DOTAs are promising chelators for MRI contrast agents owing to the improved coordination stability and relaxivity of the corresponding Gd(III) complexes. However, their broader application is limited by significant synthetic challenges arising from their multi&#8208;component nature. In this work, we report&#8212;for the first time&#8212;the use of multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) to assemble all necessary building blocks of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs in a single step. This strategy yields derivatives with faster coordination kinetics. Furthermore, we extend their application to luminescent lanthanide probes, achieving improved photophysical properties. This MCR approach offers a versatile solution for establishing a library of functionalized diagnostic and therapeutic agents. We are convinced that this work will reshape the field, inspiring broader exploration of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTA derivatives and unlocking their full potential in next&#8208;generation biomedical applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Double Bond Migration and Geometrical Isomerization in Olefins via a Spin&#8208;Accelerated Alkyl Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily accessible, well&#8208;defined iron(II) catalyst that demonstrates high efficiency and versatility in positional and geometrical alkene isomerization is presented. A comprehensive mechanistic study suggests an alkyl mechanism via an isolable iron hydride species and indicates the stereo&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination step exhibits a two&#8208;state reactivity resulting in spin acceleration and dictating the stereoselectivity outcome. 








Abstract
Despite the central relevance of metal&#8208;catalyzed alkene isomerization in academia and industry and the overarching role of iron in sustainable catalysis, highly efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed positional and geometrical isomerizations of alkenes remain long&#8208;sought&#8208;after goals. Herein, we disclose the development of an easily accessible, well&#8208;defined anilido&#8208;aldimine iron(II) alkyl catalyst that efficiently and selectively performs, for the first time, tunable olefin migration over one and multiple carbon&#8211;carbon bonds and configurational alkene isomerization. This singular catalyst behavior also unraveled the implementation of productive regiodivergent and regio&#8208; and stereoconvergent olefin isomerization processes. Notably, with only 1 equiv. of Cy2NH&#183;BH3 (relative to Fe) under mild conditions, these reactions exhibited a broad substrate scope, including (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted and aliphatic alkenes of different substitution patterns and with diverse functionalities. They also displayed high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Using experimental and computational approaches, a detailed mechanistic study of the positional isomerization regime suggested a redox&#8208;neutral alkyl&#8208;type mechanism via an isolable iron(II)&#8208;hydride species. This study indicated the stereo&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination step occurs through a two&#8208;state reactivity resulting in spin acceleration and a stereoselectivity correlated to these spin state changes. This work also elucidated the peculiar and critical role of the anilido&#8208;aldimine skeleton on the reactivity.

         <title>Deciphering Ball Milling Mechanochemistry via Molecular Simulations of Collision&#8208;Driven and Liquid&#8208;Assisted Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported by experiments, molecular dynamics simulations were developed to reveal how mechanochemical reactions, such as between KCl and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with water as a liquid additive, proceed. Product formation is triggered by collision&#8208;induced fragmentation, with liquid content showing a non&#8208;linear effect. These insights clarify how collision energy and additives affect reactivity, aiding the optimization of milling conditions.








Abstract
Mechanochemistry by ball milling proceeds through a series of discrete, high&#8208;energy collisions between milling balls and the sample, yet the molecular&#8208;level processes that govern the resulting chemical and physical transformations remain poorly understood. In this study, we develop a molecular dynamics simulation protocol to investigate a model mechanochemical reaction between potassium chloride (KCl) and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether, both under dry conditions and in the presence of water as a liquid additive. Our simulations reveal that the reaction is initiated by collision&#8208;induced fragmentation of the KCl crystal into individual ions. This process occurs when the absorbed energy per ion pair during a collision exceeds the crystal's cohesion energy. We further show that the addition of a small amount of water facilitates the formation of complexes between potassium ions and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 molecules. However, excessive water content stabilizes the reactants instead, thereby suppressing complex formation. These findings highlight a non&#8208;linear relationship between liquid additive concentration and the reaction outcome. Our approach offers a molecular&#8208;level perspective on mechanochemical reactivity, providing valuable insights that could guide the rational optimization of milling conditions&#8212;particularly the targeted selection and dosing of liquid additives&#8212;to improve reaction efficiency.

         <title>Achiral Catalyst&#8208;Induced Stereoselectivity Switch at Quaternary Stereocenter: Diastereodivergent Ring&#8208;Opening Alkylation and Enantiodivergent Arylation of Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

&#8220;one stone, a butterfly's wings, two birds&#8221; for the stereodivergence strategy. By simply changing the achiral Lewis acid from d&#8208;block metal salt ZnCl2 to lanthanide f&#8208;block metal salt DyCl3 without changing the chiral catalyst, an achiral metal cation&#8208;arene noncovalent interaction directed stereodivergence synthesis in both diastereodivergent asymmetric ring&#8208;opening alkylation and enantiodivergent arylation of oxindoles was developed in this study.








Abstract
The development of a unified strategy to achieve both diastereodivergence and enantiodivergence is a prominent yet challenging objective. In this study, a new strategy involving achiral Lewis acid &#8208;directed stereodivergence has been developed. An achiral metal salt is used as a control element to achieve a diastereoselectivity switch, which is unusual. By simply changing the achiral Lewis acids from a non&#8208;lanthanide d&#8208;block metal salt (ZnCl2) to a lanthanide f&#8208;block metal salt (DyCl3), a diastereodivergent asymmetric ring&#8208;opening alkylation of racemic oxindoles with oxabicyclic alkenes has been achieved, leading to a new series of chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles with three contiguous stereocenters bearing a dihydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ol motif with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;95:5 dr). Next, by simply switching the achiral metal Lewis acid cocatalysts while maintaining the same chiral catalyst, an enantiodivergent formal arylation has been achieved, providing chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl oxindoles featuring a triaryl&#8208;substituted quaternary stereocenter. Diverse transformations of the chiral 3,3&#8208;oxindoles delivered synthetically useful compounds. Those chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles have shown significant antiproliferative activity against HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. The relative and absolute configurations of these compounds exert prominent effects on the bioactivities, further highlighting the remarkable importance of catalytic asymmetric stereodivergent synthesis.

         <title>SiR&#8208;XActin: A Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Actin Dynamics in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiR&#8208;XActin is a far&#8208;red fluorescent probe for live&#8208;cell imaging of actin that avoids genetic modification and minimizes disruption of actin dynamics, due to its lower binding affinity. Based on jasplakinolide&#8208;like natural product hybrids and Si&#8211;Rhodamine, it offers photostable live&#8208;cell no&#8208;wash staining across cell types and microscopy techniques. Fluorophore exchange allows multicolor labeling and combination with other probes or chemigenetic tools.








Abstract
Imaging actin&#8208;dependent processes in live cells is important for understanding numerous biological processes. However, currently used natural&#8208;product&#8208;based fluorescent probes for actin filaments affect the dynamics of actin polymerization and can induce undesired cellular phenotypes. Here, we introduce SiR&#8208;XActin, a simplified jasplakinolide&#8208;based, far&#8208;red fluorescent probe that enables bright and photostable staining in various cell types without requiring genetic modifications. Due to its relatively weak binding affinity, the probe exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and labels actin filaments without significantly altering actin dynamics. Furthermore, SiR&#8208;XActin is suitable for time&#8208;resolved, live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution STED microscopy. Exchanging the SiR fluorophore in SiR&#8208;XActin for other fluorophores yields probes in different colors. All these properties make SiR&#8208;XActin and its analogs powerful tools for studying actin dynamics using live&#8208;cell fluorescence microscopy.

         <title>In Situ NMR and Kinetics Reveal Origins of Regioselectivity Differences for Epichlorohydrin Ring&#8208;Opening in Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselectivities for epichlorohydrin ring&#8208;opening over Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid zeolites change by an order of magnitude upon replacing fractions of methanol with acetonitrile co&#8208;solvent. Combining transient operando 13C&#8208;NMR with traditional kinetic measurements reveals that these differences originate from competition between an SN1 pathway through ring&#8208;opened carbocation intermediates formed from epichlorohydrin and an SN2 pathway through a methanol&#8208;derived intermediate. This work provides spectroscopic evidence for epoxide ring&#8208;opening intermediates and mechanisms not previously established over solid catalysts.








Abstract
Altering the quantities and organization of reactive species at active sites enables control of turnover rates and regioselectivities (rate ratios) for ring&#8208;opening of epichlorohydrin (C3H5ClO) across two orders of magnitude. Kinetic analysis suggests that parallel monomolecular (SN1) and bimolecular (SN2) substitution mechanisms contribute to observed rates of C3H5ClO reactions with methanol (CH3OH) over both Lewis (Sn&#8208;BEA) and Br&#248;nsted acid (Al&#8208;BEA) zeolites in liquid solvents. In situ solid&#8208;state 13C&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SS&#8208;NMR) measurements give direct evidence for the proposed ring&#8208;opened carbocations and activated CH3OH intermediates over these catalysts. Interpretation of time&#8208;resolved operando 13C&#8208;SS&#8208;NMR spectra shows that C3H5ClO&#8208;derived carbocations and CH3OH&#8208;derived surface species convert to ring&#8208;opening products through SN1 and SN2 reaction mechanisms and subsequently form distinct product regioisomers. These NMR spectra also reveal a concomitant shift from SN1 to SN2 reactions with increases in the coverage of CH3OH&#8208;derived reactive intermediates achieved by control of the local concentrations of CH3OH, C3H5ClO, and diluting CH3CN. This knowledge provides new insight into the role of coverage on regioselectivity and rates of catalytic reactions of organic species at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces.

         <title>Simultaneous Induction and Self&#8208;Reporting of Nucleolar Stress by a Nucleolus&#8208;Targeted Platinum(II) Complex via Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first example of a metal complex that can achieve simultaneous induction and self&#8208;reporting of nucleolar stress via PLIM of nucleolar viscosity. The phosphorescence response of this platinum(II) complex to viscosity is achieved by suppressing the structural distortion to the non&#8208;emissive d&#8211;d excited state and restricting the rotation of Pt&#9472;N coordination bonds.








Abstract
The nucleolus exhibits characteristic viscous fluid dynamics, whereas nucleolar stress plays a key role in carcinogenesis. However, monitoring nucleolar viscosity in living cells remains a great challenge, which also leads to the lack of a clear report on the relationship between nucleolar viscosity and nucleolar stress. Herein, a nucleolus&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex with monodentate ligands (Pt2) has been developed, which can rapidly accumulate in the nucleolus and inhibit ribosome biogenesis through energy&#8208;dependent signaling pathways, eventually inducing nucleolar stress and simultaneously monitoring nucleolar viscosity via phosphorescence lifetime imaging (PLIM). The phosphorescence response of Pt2 to viscosity is achieved by suppressing the structural distortion to the non&#8208;emissive d&#8211;d excited state and restricting the rotation of Pt&#9472;N coordination bonds, which is different from other commonly reported viscosity probes in the literature. After exposure to Pt2 or other antineoplastic agents, which can induce nucleolar stress, the gradual decrease of nucleolar viscosity is observed in living cells in a quantitative and real&#8208;time manner, indicating that nucleolar viscosity can be used as a real&#8208;time monitor of the extent of nucleolar stress. This work reports the first example of a metal complex that can achieve simultaneous induction and self&#8208;reporting of nucleolar stress via PLIM of nucleolar viscosity.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Diversified Kinetic Resolutions of Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutenones via Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation</title>

The diversified kinetic resolutions of diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones through Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation has been achieved for the first time, affording a range of diaryl&#8208;substituted four&#8208;membered ring products, which facilitates the total synthesis of six representative natural products in a stereodivergent fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the catalysts play vital roles in determining the resolution modes.








Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialkyl cyclobutanes (DA2CBs) are important scaffolds in numerous bioactive substances. However, the concise asymmetric synthesis of this type of compound remains a formidable challenge, especially in a stereodivergent manner. In this work, we report for the first time the diversified kinetic resolutions of diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones through Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH). The protocol affords a range of diaryl&#8208;substituted four&#8208;membered rings with structural and stereochemical diversity, which facilitates the total synthesis of six representative natural products in a stereodivergent fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted to reveal the origin of the three kinetic resolution modes, and the catalysts are found to play vital roles in determining the reaction pathways, a phenomenon that has been scarcely observed in the field of ATH.

         <title>Endogenous Template&#8208;Directed Topological Engineering of Lignite&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Kinetically Accelerated Sodium Storage</title>

A functional group assisted self&#8208;templating strategy is proposed for coal&#8208;based hard carbon. &#8208;OH group chelates with metal ions to form carbonates as templates, promoting closed&#8208;pore structures. C&#9552;O restricts carbon atom movement, preventing graphitization, and inducing a stable F&#8208;rich SEI. The resulting hard carbon for SIBs shows high capacity and superior rate capability.








Abstract
Coal is a promising precursor for the preparation of hard carbon, which shows great commercial potential as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between planar aromatic molecules and the trend toward graphitization lead to a highly ordered carbon structure with narrow interlayer spacing. In this study, a self&#8208;templating strategy is proposed to regulate the closed&#8208;pore structures of coal&#8208;based hard carbon at the molecular level, and finally improve the plateau capacity. The &#8208;OH is beneficial for the formation of closed&#8208;pore structure during carbonization by chelation with metal ions, and C&#9552;O can help to prevent graphitization, increase the interlayer spacing and form hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic SEI through surface functional remodeling with salt in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. The coal&#8208;based hard carbon displays good cycling stability, exhibiting a high reversible capacity (350 mAh g&#8722;1) at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of up to 88% after 8000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the full battery assembled with NVP demonstrates a stable cycling performance. This work provides new insights into the construction of closed pores and the role of carbonyl groups in hard carbons for enhancing sodium storage performance.

Develop a descriptor&#8208;guided framework through solvent oxidative stability and Na+ coordination analysis to design flame&#8208;resistant ester electrolytes surpassing diffusion limits. 








Abstract
Traditional electrolyte systems are struggle to meet practical needs for high performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their limited functionality. The design of electrolytes today relies largely on expensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies and intricate solvent&#8211;structure engineering, in which various additives and solvents are arbitrarily used without any reasonable selection rules. Motivated by this, we herein establish a descriptor&#8208;guided framework centered on solvent oxidative stability and Na+&#8208;solvent coordination chemistry to identify intrinsically flame&#8208;proof, ester&#8208;based electrolytes that overcome conventional diffusion limits. By screening a number of fluorinated phosphate and cyclic carbonate candidates, the electrolytes with the comprehensive properties, including the electrolyte desolvation processes, oxidation resistance, and flame retardancy, were successfully designed and synthesized, thereby realizing intrinsic flameproofing with fast&#8208;charging capability. Impressively, our optimized electrolytes sustain over 98% capacity retention for 350 cycles at 1.0 C with a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% when deployed in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cells, whereas benchmark carbonate systems fail within a few tens of cycles. By linking the explicit performance descriptors of solvent electronic structure and ion&#8211;solvent coordination, this work delivers a rational pathway to flame&#8208;proof and high&#8208;rate SIB electrolytes, breaking the long&#8208;standing diffusion limit and brute&#8208;force screening.

         <title>Copolymer Sequence Regulation Enabled by Reactivity Ratio Fingerprints via Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;based approach has been established with &#8220;reactivity ratio fingerprints&#8221; design, enabling instant determination of reactivity ratios from arbitrary reaction design. This approach presents exceptional versatility to analyze the condition influence (e.g., temperature, solvent) on reactivity ratios, promoting on&#8208;demand sequence regulation and azeotropic copolymerizations for a broad scope of binary and ternary copolymers.








Abstract
Sequence control is critical for tuning polymer properties in high&#8208;end applications, where reactivity ratios serve as key parameters for analyzing and regulating sequences. Nevertheless, traditional determination methods exhibit low experimental efficiency and are typically confined to two&#8208;component copolymerization. Here, we develop a machine learning platform, which leverages a novel design of &#8220;reactivity ratio fingerprints&#8221; (rFPs) to determine reactivity ratios in binary and ternary copolymerizations. Deep learning models trained on millions of rFPs enable highly efficient (millisecond&#8208;level) determination from sparse experimental data (random monomer structures, arbitrary reaction design). This approach demonstrates outstanding versatility to analyze reactivity ratios under diverse conditions (e.g., temperature, solvent). Notably, rFP&#8208;guided reaction design promotes on&#8208;demand sequence tailoring, compatible with a wide range of binary and ternary monomer combinations. Kinetic investigations and glass transition characterizations support the formation of varied sequence structures, facilitating the identification of binary and ternary azeotropic copolymerizations. This work not only unveils an attractive strategy for determining reactivity ratios but also offers a generalizable framework for sequencing complicated chain structures toward property engineering.

The biosynthesis of Ahp&#8208;bicyclodepsipeptides featuring an N51&#8208;C15 bridge linking citrulline and tyrosine residues is reported. A single CYP450 enzyme, Dlm16, has been biochemically characterized to perform this intriguing macrocyclization through sequential aromatic hydroxylation and C&#9472;N coupling. The enzymatic C&#9472;H arene amidation mediated by Dlm16 involves a primary amide as the nitrogen donor and an aromatic ring as the acceptor.








Abstract
We report the biosynthesis of FR901277 (1) and delmomycin A2 (2), two 3&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypiperidone (Ahp)&#8208;containing bicyclodepsipeptides featuring an N&#8208;C bridge linking the citrulline and tyrosine residues. This intriguing side&#8208;chain macrocyclization is catalyzed by Dlm16, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450), through a sequential process initiated by ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of the tyrosine ring, followed by intramolecular C&#9472;N coupling between the resulting catechol moiety and the terminal NH2 of the ureido group. Structure&#8208;function analyses and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis confirmed the catalytic importance of identified key residues, enabling the proposal of plausible macrocyclization mechanisms. Functional characterization of eight additional Dlm16 homologs further revealed a CYP450 subfamily capable of catalyzing C&#9472;N bond formation, underscoring the prevalence of this unusual macrocyclization in cyclodepsipeptide biosynthesis. Our work highlights nature's strategies for macrocycle construction and provides another example of CYP450&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;N coupling via direct C&#9472;H functionalization.

         <title>Discovery of a Heme&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Catalyzing Nitrogen&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Formation in Kinamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, Alp1J, was identified as the catalyst that installs N&#9472;N bond in kinamycin biosynthesis. Alp1J forms a stable complex with ferredoxin Alp1I, which is essential for activity. Together they convert l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite into a hydrazine intermediate through a four&#8208;electron reductive pathway. The discovery establishes a platform for genome mining and synthetic biology aimed at novel N&#9472;N&#8208;containing therapeutics.








Abstract
A nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen (N&#9472;N) bond is a core feature of diverse natural products with interesting structural and biological properties. Kinamycin and lomaiviticin, featuring a diazobenzo[b]fluorene core, exhibit exceptional potency as chemotherapeutic agents. However, the N&#9472;N bond forming step in their biosynthesis has remained elusive. Through extensive mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we herein report that Alp1J, belonging to a new family of heme&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyzes the N&#9472;N bond formation in kinamycin biosynthesis. Interestingly, Alp1J forms a stable complex with its partner ferredoxin Alp1I, which can protect the cofactors and is critical for the N&#9472;N bond formation activity. With its partner ferredoxin, Alp1J catalyzes formation of the hydrazine intermediate directly from l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite by a pathway involving four&#8208;electron reduction. Our findings expand the knowledge of enzymatic N&#9472;N bond formation and show the potential for the discovery and development of novel N&#9472;N bond containing natural products through genome mining and synthetic biology.

&lt;p&gt;An unexpected heme-dependent enzyme, Alp1J, was identified as the catalyst that installs N&#9472;N bond in kinamycin biosynthesis. Alp1J forms a stable complex with ferredoxin Alp1I, which is essential for activity. Together they convert &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate and nitrite into a hydrazine intermediate through a four-electron reductive pathway. The discovery establishes a platform for genome mining and synthetic biology aimed at novel N&#9472;N-containing therapeutics.

         <title>Elucidating the Critical Role of Water in Selective Hydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles on a Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model catalyst consisting of carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles with rich functional groups exhibits universal and efficient water&#8208;promoted N&#8208;heterocycle hydrogenation performance at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H2. Mechanistic studies have shown that water is crucial in providing protons directly and enhancing H2 diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation pathway on the Co catalyst.








Abstract
The ambiguous role of water as a solvent in regulating liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation activity and selectivity is of great significance to modern organic synthesis, yet remains challenging to identify. Here, we present a carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticle catalyst with a high number of functional groups, synthesized using a simple approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional water&#8208;promoted N&#8208;heterocycle hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Remarkably, 100% quinoline conversion and &gt;99% 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline selectivity can be achieved at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H2, surpassing the performance of most reported heterogeneous catalysts. Using a combination of advanced mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and theoretical analysis, we elucidate the water&#8208;promoted hydrogenation mechanism. Water is a crucial solvent because it provides protons directly and enhances H2 diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water&#8208;mediated 1&#8211;4&#8211;2&#8211;3 hydrogenation pathway on the surface of this catalyst. Based on this finding, the catalyst exhibits universal water&#8208;promoted hydrogenation performance for a wide range of N&#8208;heterocycles (14 examples with yields of over 96%). This work highlights the crucial role of water in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions and provides a new research paradigm for the future development of such reactions.

         <title>The Effect of Cap Structure and Poly(A) Positioning on mRNA Translation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We examined how protein synthesis is affected when the positions of two major structural elements of eukaryotic mRNA&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;are reversed. Reversing their orientation resulted in a marked reduction in protein production. This decrease is likely due to the essential role of cap positioning at the 5&#8242; end for efficient translation initiation, coupled with an inhibitory influence of the poly(A) positioned at the 5&#8242; end.








Abstract
We investigated the relationship between mRNA structure and translation activity using our recently developed chemical method to add a cap structure to an oligonucleotide and a technique for purifying capped mRNAs via reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing a photoreactive tag. Specifically, we designed and synthesized mRNA constructs in which the typical eukaryotic elements&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;were interchanged in position. We examined how this inversion affected translation efficiency. The results revealed that this reversed configuration abolished the synergistic enhancement of translation typically observed with correctly positioned cap and poly(A) tail, resulting in a substantial decrease in activity compared to the native orientation. Interestingly, focusing solely on the cap structure, capping at the 3&#8242; end&#8212;though less effective than at the 5&#8242; end&#8212;still promoted a measurable increase in translation. Moreover, the poly(A) sequence placed at the 5&#8242; end was found to suppress translation. We also prepared mRNAs containing a poly(A) tail with reversed 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; orientation and demonstrated that this inverted poly(A) could still enhance protein synthesis.

         <title>Alternating Magnetic Field Induced Ultra&#8208;Active Cu Sites in Trimetal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Overpotential CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of nonmagnetic Zn and Mg atoms into the Cu&#8208;based ultrathin MOF induces spin&#8208;isolated Cu(II) active sites and enables local electronic energy elevation at the Cu sites under alternating magnetic field (AMF) stimulation. This design significantly enhances proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer dynamics, achieving efficient electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at low electrode potentials. 








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction is a sustainable approach to address climate challenges, requiring energy&#8208;economic catalysts that are highly active at low electrode potentials. Herein, we developed a Cu&#8208;ZnMg ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), where Zn/Mg atoms enhance CO2 adsorption and CO desorption and the Cu sites show ultrahigh catalytic activity from CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The Cu&#8208;ZnMg MOF@AMF exhibited a high current density (25.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) at a low potential of &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE with remarkable CO selectivity (&#8764;95%), surpassing that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The incorporation of nonmagnetic metals isolates the unpaired electrons at Cu(II) active sites which are antiferromagnetically coupled in the 1D Cu(II) chains. These spin magnetic moments can effectively interact with the AMF through spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, leading to local electronic energy elevation at the Cu sites. This AMF&#8208;induced activation of isolated Cu sites promotes cooperative proton&#8208;electron transfer, thereby enabling efficient from CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at low electrode potential.

         <title>Valence&#8208;Modulated Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) Cathode Tuned by Orbital&#8208;Delocalization for Extreme&#8208;Temperature Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional NFPP cathodes suffer from slow Na&#8314; diffusion, low capacity, and structural degradation. We propose an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulation strategy, optimizing Na&#8314; pathways for ultralow&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8239;&#176;C) operation and creating multiple redox centers to boost capacity and conductivity. NFPP&#8208;2Mo exhibits enhanced structural stability, resisting electrolyte attack even at 60&#8239;&#176;C, ensuring long&#8208;term integrity. This approach enables wide&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8239;&#176;C) functionality, fast charging/discharging, and extended lifespan, addressing key Na&#8208;ion cathode challenges.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based polyanionic Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with its cost&#8208;effectiveness and stable framework. However, its commercialization is seriously hindered by sluggish Na+ kinetics, and insufficient capacity utilization. Herein, an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulated strategy is proposed to address these challenges. The lattice is stabilized by high&#8208;valence Mo6+ through robust Mo&#9472;O bonds, simultaneously reducing Na+ diffusion barriers and activating the inert Na2 sites, while electron delocalization is effectively promoted by its partially filled 3d orbitals to enhance electronic conductivity. Concurrently, additional charge compensation is also provided by Mo4+ via a reversible Mo4+/Mo6+ redox couple, enabling complete Na+ extraction/insertion and suppression of structure distortion. A record&#8208;high discharge capacity of 130.74&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C is delivered by the optimized Na4Fe2.91Mo0.09(PO4)2(P2O7) cathode, with 87.23% capacity retained after 10&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;C, along with stable operation from&#160;&#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

     alt="Valence-Modulated Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) Cathode Tuned by Orbital-Delocalization for Extreme-Temperature Sodium Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional NFPP cathodes suffer from slow Na&#8314; diffusion, low capacity, and structural degradation. We propose an orbital-delocalization assisted valence modulation strategy, optimizing Na&#8314; pathways for ultralow-temperature (&#8722;40&#8239;&#176;C) operation and creating multiple redox centers to boost capacity and conductivity. NFPP-2Mo exhibits enhanced structural stability, resisting electrolyte attack even at 60&#8239;&#176;C, ensuring long-term integrity. This approach enables wide-temperature (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8239;&#176;C) functionality, fast charging/discharging, and extended lifespan, addressing key Na-ion cathode challenges.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-based polyanionic Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with its cost-effectiveness and stable framework. However, its commercialization is seriously hindered by sluggish Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; kinetics, and insufficient capacity utilization. Herein, an orbital-delocalization assisted valence modulated strategy is proposed to address these challenges. The lattice is stabilized by high-valence Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; through robust Mo&#9472;O bonds, simultaneously reducing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barriers and activating the inert Na2 sites, while electron delocalization is effectively promoted by its partially filled 3d orbitals to enhance electronic conductivity. Concurrently, additional charge compensation is also provided by Mo&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; via a reversible Mo&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; redox couple, enabling complete Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; extraction/insertion and suppression of structure distortion. A record-high discharge capacity of 130.74&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;C is delivered by the optimized Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.91&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) cathode, with 87.23% capacity retained after 10&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;C, along with stable operation from&#160;&#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. A universal paradigm for high-performance polyanionic cathodes is established by this synergistic reinforcement approach, advancing durable and high-power SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Design of Polymer Donors Regulates Solution Aggregation and Stretchability of Organic Solar Cells</title>

Modular design of PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si balances solubility and aggregation in o&#8208;xylene, enabling fibrillar morphologies and mechanically robust stretchable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The use of nonhalogenated solvents in organic solar cell (OSC) manufacturing is crucial for environmental sustainability but remains hindered by difficulties in achieving optimal thin&#8208;film morphologies. In particular, controlling solution&#8208;state aggregation to form well&#8208;defined fibrillar networks that enable high device performance is a central challenge. Here, we present a modular molecular design strategy based on the PTzBI polymer platform, enabling simultaneous tuning of energy levels, crystalline packing, and chain flexibility to address this limitation. The resulting polymer, PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si, integrates a fluorinated backbone and siloxane&#8208;terminated side chains, showing balanced solubility and controlled solution&#8208;state aggregation in o&#8208;xylene. These network&#8208;like solution aggregates translate into enhanced molecular crystallinity and a well&#8208;organized fibrillar morphology in the solid film. The corresponding PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si:L8&#8208;BO blends achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.9% in rigid OSCs. Moreover, PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si exhibits ductile deformation with a fracture strain of &#8764;20%, leading to intrinsically stretchable OSCs with a PCE over 16%, retaining&#160;&gt;80% of the initial PCE under 40% strain. These results highlight the promise of rational, modular polymer design in advancing nonhalogenated&#8208;solvent processed, high&#8208;efficiency, and mechanically robust OSCs for scalable and wearable electronic applications.

         <title>The Laccase&#8208;Like Mechanism in Peroxymonosulfate&#8208;Based Oxidation System for Water Decontamination: Dual&#8208;Substrate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed that direct electron transfer (DET)&#8208;dominated peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PMS&#8208;AOPs) are a kind of laccase&#8208;like process, since they share similar oxidation mechanisms including dual&#8208;substrate activation, DET mechanism, pollutant polymerization, and relatively high redox potential. This new discovery means that laccase will be a good reference to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for PMS&#8208;AOPs.








Abstract
This study demonstrates that direct electron transfer (DET)&#8208;dominated peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PMS&#8208;AOPs) share a similar oxidation mechanism with laccase, including dual&#8208;substrate activation, DET mechanism, polymerization of organic pollutants, and relatively high redox potential at active site. To verify this point, a detachable catalyst (MnPc/CNT) was used. Neither manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) nor carbon nanotubes (CNT) could efficiently catalyze PMS to remove phenol (PE), whereas MnPc/CNT achieved complete PE elimination primarily through a DET mechanism. In this process, PE was mainly removed via polymerization. Importantly, galvanic cell experiments and density functional theory calculations showed that MnPc/CNT can simultaneously activate both PE and PMS, whereas MnPc or CNT alone cannot. This dual&#8208;substrate activation phenomenon was seldom reported in PMS&#8208;AOPs. Comparative studies showed that MnPc/CNT, FePc/CNT, and CoPc/CNT exhibited significantly higher PE removal efficiency than NiPc/CNT, CuPc/CNT, and ZnPc/CNT, which correlated with their higher open circuit potentials. Since&#160;current catalyst design strategies for PMS&#8208;AOPs remain largely empirical and enzyme is highly efficient catalyst, this laccase&#8208;like mechanism means that the laccase&#8208;mimetic approach will be a promising direction for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Coordinated Lipids: Facilitators for Enhanced mRNA Delivery Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of zinc&#8208;coordinated lipids (Zn&#8208;CL) into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) modifies the interaction forces between LNPs and mRNA, subsequently enhancing mRNA delivery through benefiting multiple processes, including cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and mRNA release. Zn&#8208;CL LNPs hold substantial promise to augment the therapeutic efficiency of mRNA and advance their clinical application.








Abstract
The advancement of mRNA therapeutics necessitates more efficient delivery systems. Current clinically advanced lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) primarily bind mRNA through electrostatic interactions, with limited exploration of other intermolecular forces that can benefit multiple delivery processes. Here, we design zinc&#8208;coordinated lipids (Zn&#8208;CL) to formulate LNPs, enabling high mRNA delivery efficacy in vivo. The zinc&#8208;coordinated moieties in ionizable lipids show strong affinity toward phosphate groups, yielding tight yet reversible mRNA encapsulation. In addition, due to the abundance of phosphate groups in biological membranes, Zn&#8208;CL lipids engage them to boost enhanced cellular uptake. Once inside endosomes, competitive binding of zinc&#8208;coordinated moieties to the membranes strengthens endosomal destabilization and weakens Zn&#8209;CL/mRNA interactions, enabling efficient endosomal escape as well as rapid cytosolic mRNA release and resolving the long&#8209;standing paradox between stable encapsulation and efficient release. As a result, zinc coordination introduction simultaneously solves multiple mRNA delivery obstacles, ultimately leading to 29&#8208;fold higher mRNA translation than FDA&#8208;approved SM&#8208;102 LNPs in vivo. Notably, this coordination strategy is extendable to other metal ions, with cobalt&#8208;coordinated lipids facilitating spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. These findings highlight the substantial potential of metal&#8208;coordinated lipids as a versatile platform for enhancing mRNA therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Quantitative Reactivity Profiling of Functional Arginine Residues in Human Cancer Cell Line Proteomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent probe targeting arginine was used along with the proteomic platform isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis&#8208;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP) to identify hyperreactive arginine residues in the human proteome of cancer cell lines. This approach underscores the essential role of arginine in protein function, highlighting its biological importance and therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Arginine, a critical amino acid for protein structure and function, is involved in enzyme catalysis and macromolecular interactions. However, selectively targeting its reactive guanidine group has been challenging. Here, we utilized a probe, AP&#8208;1, based on phenylglyoxal, which demonstrated remarkable chemical selectivity and reactivity toward arginine residues. Using activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP), we explored the human proteome across four cancer cell lines, obtaining quantitative data for approximately 3500 arginine residues. This analysis led to the identification of several previously unreported hyperreactive arginine residues, including R43 of PKM, R171 of LDHA, R172 of LDHB, R341 of CKB, R168 of EIF4A1, and R118 of FUBP1, which are crucial for protein function. Notably, the mutation of CKB's R341 inhibited cell proliferation and migration by downregulating energy supply. We also introduced ArGO&#8208;LDHA&#8208;1, a covalent inhibitor targeting LDHA's hyperreactive arginine residues, showing potential to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. This work highlights the biological significance of arginine residues and provides a platform for large&#8208;scale profiling of arginine reactivity.

Here, we utilized a probe, &lt;b&gt;AP-1&lt;/b&gt;, based on phenylglyoxal, which demonstrated remarkable chemical selectivity and reactivity toward arginine residues. Using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), we explored the human proteome across four cancer cell lines, obtaining quantitative data for approximately 3500 arginine residues. This analysis led to the identification of several previously unreported hyperreactive arginine residues, including R43 of PKM, R171 of LDHA, R172 of LDHB, R341 of CKB, R168 of EIF4A1, and R118 of FUBP1, which are crucial for protein function. Notably, the mutation of CKB's R341 inhibited cell proliferation and migration by downregulating energy supply. We also introduced &lt;b&gt;ArGO-LDHA-1&lt;/b&gt;, a covalent inhibitor targeting LDHA's hyperreactive arginine residues, showing potential to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. This work highlights the biological significance of arginine residues and provides a platform for large-scale profiling of arginine reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Engineering of a Pseudaminic Acid Synthase Enzyme Enables Access to a 3&#8208;Fluoro Sugar with Motility Inhibition in Bacterial Pathogens</title>

Rational engineering of a pseudaminic acid synthase enzyme (PseI) enables the synthesis of a 3&#8208;fluorinated pseudaminic acid sugar (3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac), which can be processed to the fluorinated CMP&#8208;donor in vitro by a synthetase enzyme, and impairs the motility of the gut pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, demonstrating the potential utility of fluorinated bacterial &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars as anti&#8208;motilins.








Abstract
We report the rational engineering of a pseudaminic acid synthase (PseI), which enables the first synthesis of a 3&#8208;fluorinated pseudaminic acid sugar (3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac), potentially establishing a new class of metabolic inhibitors targeting bacterial glycosylation. Pseudaminic acids are &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars essential for O&#8208;glycosylation of flagellin in pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni, where they are critical for motility and virulence. By introducing rational mutations in the PseI active site, we achieve enhanced turnover with unnatural 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phosphoenolpyruvate, facilitating a scalable chemoenzymatic synthesis of the fluorinated sugar. Subsequent treatment of C. jejuni with 3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac resulted in a significant, time&#8208;dependent reduction in motility, and in vitro studies demonstrated bacterial CMP&#8208;pseudaminic acid synthetase enzymes (PseF) can process the fluoro sugar to afford CMP&#8208;3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac, potentially implicating the fluorinated pseudaminic acid or its glycosyltransferase CMP&#8208;donor as an anti&#8208;motilin in vivo. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that fluorinated pseudaminic acids can impair bacterial motility, paving the way for anti&#8208;virulence strategies in pathogenic bacteria. This anti&#8208;motilin approach offers a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, addressing the urgent need for novel strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance, and could be extended to other bacterial &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Singlet Oxygen Generation via Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Intersystem Crossing in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ESIPT&#8208;capable molecules with distinct dimensionalities were designed, exhibiting opposing ESIPT behaviors upon excitation. The 2D THTA undergoes complete ESIPT, enabling efficient intersystem crossing and robust 1O2 generation. This study highlights the pivotal role of ESIPT in triplet&#8208;state formation and pioneers its application for sustainable ESIPT&#8208;based catalysis. 








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a key reactive species in photodynamic therapy and organic synthesis. Conventional generation of 1O2 relies on metal&#8208;containing sensitizers to promote intersystem crossing (ISC) and thereby activate molecular oxygen (3O2), which limits biocompatibility and scalability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free strategy leveraging excited&#8208;state intramolecular&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) to enhance 1O2 production. Two classes of ESIPT&#8208;active materials, 1D polymers and 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), were systematically compared. Interestingly, while the ESIPT transition in the 1D polymer is incomplete and unstable, 2D COF enables a highly stabilized tautomeric transition, resulting in a persistent metastable state that acts as a gateway to enhanced ISC. This difference is due to a reversed ESIPT pathway dictated by ground&#8208;state geometry. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the ESIPT transition process in the 2D COF triggers ISC, facilitating 1O2 generation. Thermodynamic analysis reduces the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and increases dipole moment changes, while spin&#8211;orbit coupling and frontier molecular orbital reorganization indicate kinetic facilitation of ISC. This work highlights the unique advantages of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;based ESIPT transformations, offering a groundbreaking approach to boosting ISC efficiency and 1O2 generation, expanding the scope of ESIPT in photocatalytic applications.

Specific high affinity recognition of colchicine by an engineered anticalin involves loop dynamics and conformational selection








Abstract
The engineered lipocalin Colchicalin binds the clinically relevant plant toxin colchicine with picomolar affinity. X&#8208;ray structures revealed major loop rearrangements at the open end of the &#946;&#8208;barrel upon ligand binding, suggesting a critical role for protein dynamics. Here, we integrated solution NMR relaxation experiments with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov modelling to examine conformational dynamics in the free and ligand&#8208;bound Colchicalin on the picosecond&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale. Fast backbone dynamics were comparable in the presence and absence of colchicine, indicating preserved secondary structure. However, large&#8208;scale fluctuations in the structurally variable loops on the microsecond&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale were observed in the apo form. We identified conformational exchange between three states, binding competent, partially closed and fully closed, characterised by loop L3 rearrangements. Colchicine binding quenches these motions, indicating a strong interplay between protein dynamics and ligand recognition. Our results support conformational selection over induced fit as the binding mechanism, highlighting the critical role of slow&#8208;timescale dynamics to enable specific, high&#8208;affinity ligand recognition and providing an important example for rational drug design.

         <title>Redox Reactions with Calcium&#8208;Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium metal nanoparticles (5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm) are realized by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with [LiNaph] in toluene. Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold.








Abstract
Calcium is generally a highly reactive alkaline&#8208;earth metal, but as bulk metal, it exhibits only low reactivity at ambient conditions due to small surface area, low solubility, and/or passivation. The reactivity can be significantly enhanced when using small&#8208;sized calcium nanoparticles. In this regard, we describe the first synthesis of Ca(0) nanoparticles, 5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm in size, by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with lithium naphthalenide in toluene (TMEDA: N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine). We also show Ca(0) nanoparticles to be substantially different from so&#8208;called &#8220;Rieke calcium&#8221;. The high reactivity can be used for redox reactions, for instance, with [Cp2MoCl2] and the sterically demanding &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand HDippNacNac (Dipp: 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) or with [(Ph3P)AuCl] as a derivative of a ligand&#8208;stabilized noble metal. The Ca(0)&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;driven reactions result in the novel compounds [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] (1) with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] (2) with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 (3) with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold. Ca(0) nanoparticles and the compounds 1&#8211;3 are characterized by electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (single crystals, powders), spectroscopy (IR, UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, EPR), and computation. Exemplarily, the formation of 1&#8211;3 points to the potential of nanosized alkaline&#8208;earth metals for chemical syntheses and the different reactivity of nanosized and bulk metals.

Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac)(thf)Ca}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](naph)(tmeda)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; with a non-charged body-centered cubic Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; cluster core of zerovalent gold.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium is generally a highly reactive alkaline-earth metal, but as bulk metal, it exhibits only low reactivity at ambient conditions due to small surface area, low solubility, and/or passivation. The reactivity can be significantly enhanced when using small-sized calcium nanoparticles. In this regard, we describe the first synthesis of Ca(0) nanoparticles, 5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm in size, by TMEDA-supported reduction of CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with lithium naphthalenide in toluene (TMEDA: N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;-tetramethylethylenediamine). We also show Ca(0) nanoparticles to be substantially different from so-called &#8220;&lt;i&gt;Rieke calcium&lt;/i&gt;&#8221;. The high reactivity can be used for redox reactions, for instance, with [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and the sterically demanding &#946;-diketiminate ligand H&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac (Dipp: 2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or with [(Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)AuCl] as a derivative of a ligand-stabilized noble metal. The Ca(0)-nanoparticle-driven reactions result in the novel compounds [{(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac)(thf)Ca}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(naph)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fulvalene)] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](naph)(tmeda)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) with a non-charged body-centered cubic Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; cluster core of zerovalent gold. Ca(0) nanoparticles and the compounds &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt; are characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (single crystals, powders), spectroscopy (IR, UV-Vis, NMR, EPR), and computation. Exemplarily, the formation of &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt; points to the potential of nanosized alkaline-earth metals for chemical syntheses and the different reactivity of nanosized and bulk metals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buried Interface Modification for High Performance and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Triphenylamine derivatives (TAPC) act as an effective passivating agent. The resulting modified molecular layer establishes a gradient arrangement of thermal expansion coefficients between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite, effectively mitigating stress accumulation within the perovskite film. This method effectively alleviated the accumulated stress within the membrane, reduced the barrier for hole transport at the interface, inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination, and ultimately increased the PCE from 24.22% to 26.05%.








Abstract
Residual stress can cause distortion of the perovskite lattice, resulting in the formation of local defects such as dislocation and vacancy. These defects serve as non&#8208;radiative recombination centers and significantly affect the stability of perovskite films.&#8204; In this study, triphenylamine derivative (TAPC) was designed as an effective passivating agent. The resulting modified molecular layer established a gradient arrangement of thermal expansion coefficients between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite, effectively mitigating stress accumulation within the perovskite film. This modification concurrently enhanced hole transport capability and optimized the energy level alignment. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized perovskite solar cell (PSCs) increased from 24.22% to 26.05%, with the fill factor (FF) rising from 83.2% to 85.2%. Furthermore, the device achieved the lowest open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss reported for comparable 1.55&#160;eV bandgap PSCs, while maintaining excellent long&#8208;term stability. Importantly, this strategy also enabled a corresponding flexible PSC (F&#8208;PSCs) to achieve a remarkable PCE of 24.39%. Collectively, these results demonstrate a promising pathway for buried interface modification of perovskite films and the fabrication of high&#8208;performance F&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Isomeric &#928; Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Nitrogen Topologies for Integrated Gold Adsorption and Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric nitrogen&#8208;topology&#8208;guided &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz and v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Pz) are developed that integrate selective adsorption and efficient photoreduction of AuCl4&#8211;. The v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz shows higher Au3&#8314; uptake (2465 mg g&#8722;1), and both COFs achieve &gt;99% gold extraction under visible light, establishing a topology&#8208;directed paradigm for COF&#8208;based precious metal recovery.








Abstract
Gold recovery from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) presents a significant materials challenge, as conventional systems lack structural tunability, exhibit poor metal selectivity, and fail to integrate adsorption and photoreduction functionalities effectively. Herein, we present a topology&#8208;guided strategy based on two isomeric &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz and v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Pz), incorporating diazine (ortho&#8208;N) and pyrazine (para&#8208;N) units, respectively, for integrated gold adsorption and photoreduction. The nitrogen topology not only stabilizes the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone but also significantly modulates the frameworks&#8217; optoelectronic and redox properties. Notably, v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz exhibits a markedly higher Au3&#8314; adsorption capacity (2465&#160;versus 1854&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1), attributed to enhanced interfacial electron localization and directional charge transfer to Au3&#8314; centers. Both frameworks achieve over 99% gold extraction from real e&#8208;waste leachates under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Spectroscopic characterization and DFT analysis reveal that nitrogen topology governs metal coordination strength and electronic coupling, enabling precise Au&#8211;Cl bond activation. This work establishes a nitrogen&#8208;topology&#8208;directed design paradigm for light&#8208;driven, COF&#8208;based precious metal recovery systems.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Hard Carbons: A Fully Organic SEI Enables Low&#8208;Coordination Interfacial Environments and Fast Na+ Desolvation</title>

A fully organic Poly(MMA) SEI reconstructs the interfacial coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane, weakens solvation, and accelerates desolvation kinetics.








Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging capability becomes a critical bottleneck for the practical deployment of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), particularly due to sluggish Na+ desolvation and interfacial transport at hard carbon (HC) anodes. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on Na+ desolvation and transport kinetics across solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) with diverse chemical natures. Although inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs are generally regarded as favorable for Na+ transport, our results reveal that certain organic&#8208;rich SEIs can deliver comparable or even superior kinetic performance. Guided by these insights, we construct a Poly(MMA)&#8208;based artificial SEI on commercial HC (Type&#8208;1), which reorganizes the Na+&#8211;DME solvation shell at the inner Helmholtz plane into a Na+&#8211;DME/Poly(MMA) coordination environment. This interfacial reconstruction markedly enhances Na+ desolvation and interphase transport, enabling exceptional rate performance (236&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (99% capacity retention over 1000 cycles) for the commercial Type&#8208;1 HC. The effectiveness of the Poly(MMA)&#8208;derived interphase is further validated in both coin&#8208;type and pouch&#8208;type full sodium&#8208;ion chemistries, as well as in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This work unveils the pivotal role of interfacial solvation structure, beyond the organic/inorganic ratios of SEI, in governing Na+ kinetics, offering a new design paradigm for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

C&#9552;O/COOH groups coordinate Li+ and anchor TFSI&#8722;, while an electron&#8208;deficient benzene enables anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, improving ion transport and interfacial stability. PCLA delivers 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 ionic conductivity, 57.04&#160;MPa strength, and stable cycling in LFP and NCM811 full cells.








Abstract
Cellulose&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) offer advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, renewability, and environmental friendliness, making them ideal candidates for lithium metal batteries. However, the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds within the cellulose framework hinder lithium ion (Li+) transport and reduce ion mobility, limiting their practical applications. In this study, we developed a cellulose trimellitate ester (PCLA) with a double&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; structure: 1) the carbonyl group (C&#9552;O) as a Li+ donor, 2) the carboxyl group (COOH) serves as a hydrogen bond donor to anchor the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) anion, and 3) the electron&#8208;deficient benzene ring (Ph) interacts with the TFSI&#8722; anion through the anion&#8208;&#960; mechanism. The resulting PCLA QPE achieved high ionic conductivity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and excellent tensile strength (57.04&#160;MPa). Full&#8208;cell batteries with LFP and NCM811 cathodes exhibited exceptional cycling stability with remaining 85% and 90% of their initial capacity after 1000 and 200 cycles, respectively. This double&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; molecular design paves the way for cellulose&#8208;based solid electrolytes with commercial potential, advancing next&#8208;generation safe energy storage technologies.

         <title>Unravelling the Dynamic Modulation of Copper (Oxy)Hydroxides for Electrocatalytic Organic Nucleophile Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy centers drive electrocatalytic nucleophile oxidation (NOR) via dual&#8208;site synergy with adsorbed OH*. Enables near&#8208;quantitative 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) conversion (97.1% yield/Faradaic efficiency) with &gt;100&#160;h stability. Mechanism governs broad substrate reactivity, establishing dynamic active&#8208;center engineering for transition&#8208;metal (oxy)hydroxide catalysts. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nucleophile oxidation (NOR) is pivotal for renewable energy and sustainable synthesis, yet the ambiguous nature of active sites hinders catalyst design. Herein, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic activation of CuO under NOR using surface voltammetry, in situ Raman, and impedance spectroscopies. Direct voltametric and spectroscopic evidences reveal that the adsorbed hydroxyl&#8208;bridged Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy species (&#956;2&#8208;OH&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy, 2&#160;&#8804;&#160;&#948;&#160;&#8804;&#160;3) are the catalytically active centers for the reaction. Experimental&#8211;theoretical synergy reveals that the dynamic &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy interacts with stabilized OH* to form a dual&#8208;site, dictating the structure&#8211;activity relationship. This mechanism enables near&#8208;quantitative conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (97.1% yield/Faradaic efficiency) with&#160;&gt;&#160;100&#160;h stability. The mechanistic insights we obtained show broad applicability across various nucleophilic substrates, where substituent effects, carbon chain flexibility, and &#945;&#8208;hydrogen mobility govern reactivity variations. This study establishes dynamic active center engineering as a universal strategy for designing transition&#8208;metal (oxy)hydroxide catalysts, bridging electrocatalysis and precision organic synthesis.

         <title>Cyclometalated Gold(III)&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Arylation: A Bioorthogonal Platform for Covalent Targeting of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclometalated Au(III) complexes have been designed to rapidly and selectively arylate cysteine residues within intrinsically disordered protein regions, enabling covalent labeling of previously &#8220;undruggable&#8221; cysteines. This gold&#8208;based platform expands the accessible cysteinome for proteome&#8208;wide profiling and offers new opportunities for targeting disordered proteins.








Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) remain largely inaccessible to covalent chemical tools due to their structural plasticity and lack of defined pockets. We introduce a bioorthogonal cyclometalated gold(III) platform of monodentate phosphine&#8208;supported AuP1&#8208;8 complexes that selectively and irreversibly arylate cysteine residues via enhanced Lewis acidity. This platform enables targeting of low&#8208;reactivity, buried, or dynamically disordered cysteines across the human proteome. Chemoproteomic, structural, and computational analyses establish an expanded ligandable cysteinome, including transiently helical LLCLL motifs in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Our findings establish a new class of metal&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reagents for proteome&#8208;wide cysteine labeling, functional interrogation of disordered proteins, and future therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT) Dyes into Bright Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile supramolecular strategy to transform environment&#8208;sensitive twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes into bright fluorophores with retained large Stokes shifts in aqueous media is reported. By embedding TICT dyes within a rigid microdomain provided by a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, nonradiative decay pathways, particularly the TICT process, are effectively suppressed, leading to enhanced radiative emission.








Abstract
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes are promising candidates for bioimaging and sensing due to their environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescence and large Stokes shifts. However, their inherently low fluorescence quantum yields in aqueous media have limited their practical applications. Here, we present a general supramolecular strategy to transform a broad range of TICT dyes into bright fluorophores with large Stokes shifts. By noncovalently dispersing the dyes into the rigid microdomain of a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold in water, the formation of the non&#8208;radiative TICT state is effectively suppressed. The resulting supramolecular TICT dyes exhibit dramatically enhanced fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42.3%), while preserving large Stokes shifts of up to 107&#160;nm. Particularly, supramolecular TICT dyes emitting in the NIR region display excellent photostability, enabling applications in long&#8208;term bioimaging and single&#8208;excitation multi&#8208;color imaging in live cells. This work offers a versatile and modular supramolecular approach to generate high&#8208;performance fluorophores from otherwise low&#8208; or non&#8208;emissive TICT dyes, greatly broadening their potential in biological and optical applications.

         <title>A Heterogenised Molecular Electrocatalyst for Round&#8208;the&#8208;Clock Green Hydrogen Production by Solar&#8208;Electrolyser and Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

A silica&#8208;anchored cobaloxime catalyst enables efficient seawater electrolysis and energy storage. Coupled with photovoltaics and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries, this multifunctional system delivers continuous green H2 production, offering a scalable and sustainable pathway for renewable fuel generation. 








Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven seawater electrolysis presents a sustainable method for producing high&#8208;purity green hydrogen to address the energy crisis. Developing a robust electrocatalyst for seawater splitting is crucial for green fuel production with solar integration. This study introduces a silica&#8208;anchored cobaloxime system as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for overall seawater splitting in conjunction with photovoltaic cells. The system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen generation efficiency of 14%, a power conversion efficiency of 17.4%, and a round&#8208;trip energy efficiency of 80%. A single&#8208;stack electrolyser using this catalyst produces an average of 0.82&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 of green hydrogen and 0.44&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 of oxygen, with a hydrogen conversion efficiency of approximately 80&#160;kWh kg&#8722;1 under natural sunlight.

&lt;p&gt;A silica-anchored cobaloxime catalyst enables efficient seawater electrolysis and energy storage. Coupled with photovoltaics and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries, this multifunctional system delivers continuous green H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, offering a scalable and sustainable pathway for renewable fuel generation. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar energy-driven seawater electrolysis presents a sustainable method for producing high-purity green hydrogen to address the energy crisis. Developing a robust electrocatalyst for seawater splitting is crucial for green fuel production with solar integration. This study introduces a silica-anchored cobaloxime system as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for overall seawater splitting in conjunction with photovoltaic cells. The system achieves a solar-to-hydrogen generation efficiency of 14%, a power conversion efficiency of 17.4%, and a round-trip energy efficiency of 80%. A single-stack electrolyser using this catalyst produces an average of 0.82&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of green hydrogen and 0.44&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of oxygen, with a hydrogen conversion efficiency of approximately 80&#160;kWh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under natural sunlight. The same catalyst also shows bidirectional O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and evolution activity, enabling solar energy storage through a rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (RZAB). A photovoltaic-RZAB-electrolyser triad was established for indirect green hydrogen production using stored renewable energy. The catalyst-containing RZAB system is effectively charged by a photovoltaic (PV)&#160;cell, achieving 25% energy efficiency, and facilitates seawater splitting without sunlight at an energy conversion efficiency of 84%.

         <title>Improving Oxygen Electroreduction Efficiency of Porous Silicon&#8208;based Catalysts via Atomic Iron Site&#8208;Induced Lattice Expansion</title>

A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and stability of Fe incorporation into porous Si catalysts for the acidic ORR.



Abstract
Developing non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts as alternatives to precious metals for the 4 electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions is crucial in advancing practical proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) technology. A significant challenge in designing these electrocatalysts is to suppress metal leaching and optimize the adsorption and dissociation free energy of oxygen intermediates during the reaction. Herein, a carbon&#8208;encapsulated porous silicon (Si) featuring single iron (Fe) sites was developed as an effective ORR catalyst through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction process using silica nanoparticles as precursors. This catalyst exhibited both impressive activity with half&#8208;wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.88&#160;V and 0.95&#160;V, alongside robust stability showing minimal decay of 7 and 4&#160;mV after 40,000 potential cycles under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Additionally, as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs, it reached a peak power density of 0.63&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#160;bar H2&#8211;O2 condition, while maintaining notable durability at a constant potential of 0.5&#160;V over a duration of 100 h. Spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that iron atoms were effectively integrated into the crystal lattice of porous Si, resulting in the formation of stable Si&#9472;Fe bonds that inhibited the leaching of Fe and the formation of *OOH intermediates, thereby enhancing the ORR performance. This approach facilitates the design of efficient and stable ORR catalysts, which hold significant implications for the advancement of next&#8208;generation PEMFCs.

         <title>Mechanochemically Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops mechanochemically induced circularly polarized luminescence (MICPL) in polymers by integrating achiral mechanophores into chiral polymer networks, where mechanical compression triggers fluorophore release and aggregation with chirality transfer, enabling tunable CPL colors, including white light and potential as stress&#8208;reporting probes.








Abstract
Achieving diversified optical signals in polymer mechanochemistry remains a significant challenge, particularly within the area of light polarization. This work pioneers the development of mechanochemically induced circularly polarized luminescence (MICPL) in polymers. We have designed crosslinked polymer networks by photopolymerizing achiral mechanophores (Diels&#8211;Alder adducts of maleimide and anthracene derivatives) with the chiral monomer L(&#8208;)&#8208;bornyl acrylate (LBA). Mechanical compression triggers the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the mechanophores, releasing fluorophores. Crucially, the applied force simultaneously promotes the aggregation of these released fluorophores and transfers the nonreciprocal chirality inherent in the compressed chiral polymer matrix (PLBA) to these aggregates, resulting in bright, force&#8208;dependent CPL emission with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to 10&#8722;2. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated with a series of mechanophores with varying electronic structures and copolymer matrix, enabling tunable CPL colors spanning from blue&#8208;violet to green to yellow&#8211;orange, and a ternary system achieving white CPL. The MICPL property was retained in copolymer systems (e.g., copolymers with achiral monomer methyl acrylate), demonstrating its potential as a macromolecular chiral optical probe for multimodal stress reporting. These findings resolve questions about mechanical force&#8208;regulated chirality and offer a platform for on&#8208;demand CPL materials.

         <dc:description>
Two small molecules, L8&#8208;CT and L8&#8208;2CT, were designed by gradually replacing the end group of L8&#8208;BO from an electron acceptor to electron donor. The introduction of L8&#8208;2CT significantly enhances the donor&#8211;acceptor molecular percolation at the interface, so that enabling auxiliary charge generation and transport pathways. The PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;2CT ternary device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 20.33%, with simultaneously enhanced photostability.








Abstract
The commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs) is limited by bottlenecks including relatively high voltage loss, insufficient donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial charge generation, and morphological instability. Traditional approaches of interfacial regulation usually struggle with unmatching energetic landscape and/or molecular compatibility. In this study, two small molecules, L8&#8208;CT and L8&#8208;2CT are designed and synthesized by end&#8208;group substitution of the star nonfullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO, gradually switching it from electron acceptor to electron donor. Moreover, L8&#8208;2CT with full end&#8208;group substitution exhibits exceptional compatibility/miscibility with both donor (PM6) and acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) in the ternary blend. The tight molecular packing between L8&#8208;2CT and L8&#8208;BO also reduces exciton diffusion time by an order of magnitude compared to PM6:L8&#8208;BO. The introduction of L8&#8208;2CT significantly enhances the donor&#8211;acceptor molecular percolation at the interface so that enabling auxiliary charge generation and transport pathways, thereby boosting the interfacial charge generation efficiency and morphology stability. Therefore, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;2CT ternary device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 20.33%, with simultaneously enhanced photostability. This achievement fundamentally challenges the traditional design paradigms for third components in ternary OSCs.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Ground&#8208; and Excited&#8208;State Redox Potentials in Iridium(III) Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven framework integrating density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) predicts ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials of Ir(III) photocatalysts. Unified models enable interpretable structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis and efficient virtual screening, supporting rational molecular design for advanced photoredox catalysis.








Abstract
This study introduces a data&#8208;driven framework that combines DFT calculations with machine learning to facilitate accurate and scalable predictions of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials for iridium(III) photocatalysts. We first constructed independent models to identify key geometric and electronic descriptors governing redox behavior. Shapley additive explanations&#8208;based analyses revealed clear structure&#8211;activity relationships, offering mechanistic insights and rational guidance for tuning redox potentials. Based on these insights, we developed unified multi&#8208;output models&#8212;Model G for ground&#8208;state and Model E for excited&#8208;state redox potentials&#8212;to enable rapid, cost&#8208;effective, and high&#8208;throughput predictions. By modeling oxidation and reduction processes within a shared descriptor space, we can reduce computational overhead while maintaining high predictive accuracy. To assess cross&#8208;metal generalizability, residual transfer learning was applied to osmium (Os) photocatalysts. Using feature&#8208;similar complexes, the resulting transfer models (G&#8208;T, E&#8208;T) achieved performance comparable to Os&#8208;only baselines, demonstrating efficient few&#8208;shot cross&#8208;metal transfer. Collectively, this study establishes an interpretable and transferable machine&#8208;learning framework for photocatalyst discovery. This framework provides a foundation for large&#8208;scale screening and rational design across diverse transition&#8208;metal platforms, accelerating advancements in photoredox catalysis, solar fuel production, and broader sustainable energy technologies.

Based on these insights, we developed unified multi-output models&#8212;Model G for ground-state and Model E for excited-state redox potentials&#8212;to enable rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput predictions. By modeling oxidation and reduction processes within a shared descriptor space, we can reduce computational overhead while maintaining high predictive accuracy. To assess cross-metal generalizability, residual transfer learning was applied to osmium (Os) photocatalysts. Using feature-similar complexes, the resulting transfer models (G-T, E-T) achieved performance comparable to Os-only baselines, demonstrating efficient few-shot cross-metal transfer. Collectively, this study establishes an interpretable and transferable machine-learning framework for photocatalyst discovery. This framework provides a foundation for large-scale screening and rational design across diverse transition-metal platforms, accelerating advancements in photoredox catalysis, solar fuel production, and broader sustainable energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Non&#8208;Oxidative C&#8211;C Coupling of Benzene to Biphenyl Over Sub&#8208;Nanostructured Europium Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a sub&#8208;nanostructured europium hydride catalyst supported on MgO which enables direct benzene coupling to produce biphenyl under mild conditions (&#8804;&#160;150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic studies reveal that the crucial role of hydride species for C&#9472;H bond activation and C&#9472;C construction in the catalytic cycle, which is fundamentally different from the conventional aryl&#8211;aryl coupling routes. 








Abstract
Catalytic coupling of benzene to biphenyl through direct C&#9472;H bond activation and C&#9472;C bond construction represents an ideal, atom&#8208;economical strategy, offering a streamlined alternative to classical multi&#8208;step functionalization approaches, and thus has been a long&#8208;sought after goal. Herein, we report that such a pathway can be realized over a sub&#8208;nanostructured europium hydride (Eu&#8211;H) catalyst under mild condition. The Eu&#8211;H catalyst achieved a biphenyl production of 53.7&#160;mmol&#160;gEu&#8722;1 with a turnover number (TON) of 16.3 over 144&#160;h at 150&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydride species (H&#8722;) in Eu&#8211;H preferentially deprotonate benzene to form a [C6H5&#8211;Eu] intermediate, which subsequently undergoes nucleophilic attack on another benzene molecule, resulting in biphenyl formation and regeneration of the Eu&#8211;H species to complete the catalytic cycle. This work not only provides a strategy for benzene coupling to biphenyl but also demonstrates the promising role of hydrides in transforming arenes into value&#8208;added molecules.

         <title>Closing Electron Transfer Loop to Boost Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed&#8208;loop electron transfer strategy employing fullerene (C60) achieves synergistic coupling of electrochemical and chemical processes through its reversible redox mediation, effectively suppressing over&#8208;reduction of Cu active sites. The generated fullerene anions (C60&#8319;&#8722;) spontaneously reduce nitrate to nitrite while regenerating C60, bypassing the thermodynamic rate&#8208;limiting step and optimizing the electrocatalytic reaction pathway of urea synthesis.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of carbon dioxide and nitrate presents a promising approach for environmentally friendly urea synthesis. In this work, we propose a strategy to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis by coupling the electrochemical and chemical steps. Utilizing fullerene (C60) as a redox&#8208;active electron mediator during the electrochemical reduction process, we effectively inhibit the irreversible reduction deactivation of positively charged copper (Cu&#948;+) active sites. The electron&#8208;accepting fullerene form ions (C60n&#8211;) that engage in a spontaneous chemical redox reaction with nitrate ions, producing nitrite ions and regenerating neutral C60 (C60n&#8211; + NO3&#8211; &#8594; C60&#160;+&#160;NO2&#8211;). This recycling mechanism closes the electron transfer loop while optimizing the overall reaction pathway. The urea yield rate is dramatically increased to 385.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, accompanied by long&#8208;term durability. Our findings provide a valuable framework for designing highly efficient electrocatalyst for coupling reactions, advancing the field of sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastics into Carboxylic Acids for Biodegradable Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable surfactants have now been created from post&#8208;consumer waste HDPE. High conversion (&gt;80%) is maintained throughout all major process steps including pyrolysis, hydroformylation, and oxidation. The utility of the plastic&#8208;derived carboxylate surfactant is confirmed via critical micelle concentration, surface tension, and foaming measurements.








Abstract
This work outlines a process for producing high&#8208;purity (&gt;95%) carboxylate surfactants from post&#8208;consumer recycled high&#8208;density polyethylene (PCR&#8208;HDPE). The approach involves the thermal depolymerization of PCR&#8208;HDPE via pyrolysis, followed by fractional distillation to isolate C9&#8211;C14 olefins. These olefins undergo hydroformylation using cobalt carbonyl catalysts to generate aldehydes, which are subsequently oxidized to carboxylic acids using Pinnick oxidation under mild aqueous&#8208;phase conditions. Neutralization of the resulting carboxylic acids with sodium hydroxide produces plastic&#8208;derived carboxylate surfactants (PDCs) in the form of sodium carboxylates. Subsequent purification steps ensure surfactant&#8208;grade purity and enable accurate assessment of physicochemical properties. The resulting PDCs are evaluated for critical micelle concentration (CMC), foamability, surface tension reduction, and calcium ion tolerance, demonstrating competitive behavior with conventional anionic carboxylate surfactants. This route provides a sustainable alternative for surfactant production, reducing reliance on fossil&#8208;derived feedstocks and valorizing plastic waste streams through chemical upcycling.

         <title>Enhancing NMR Signals in Liquids by Fluorine&#8208;19 Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) and Hyperpolarization Transfer to Carbon&#8208;13</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine nuclear spins can be hyperpolarized in solution by Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization from a paramagnetic agent like galvinoxyl. This hyperpolarization can be transferred by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to nearby 13C, leading to 13C signal enhancements up to &#8764;100. The method opens new opportunities for NMR structural determination of fluorine&#8208;containing drugs and synthetic molecules.








Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) plays an essential role in life and material science but suffers from low sensitivity due to the small energy differences it aims to detect. Therefore, techniques that can increase spin polarization, and thus sensitivity, in NMR are gaining tremendous attention. Overhauser effect dynamic nuclear polarization (OE&#8208;DNP) can increase multidimensional NMR signals of small molecules in liquid solutions; however, at high magnetic fields, the direct mechanism to 13C is site selective, while it is poorly efficient for 1H. Here, we report OE&#8208;DNP hyperpolarization of fluorine&#8208;19 (19F) nuclei at 9.4&#160;T, thus expanding the methodological toolbox of 19F NMR. Signal enhancements up to &#8764;20 under steady&#8208;state conditions can be used to either rapidly detect 19F resonances or to enhance through&#8208;bond J&#8208;coupled 13C nuclei by two orders of magnitude. The latter corresponds to a 104 gain in signal acquisition. We demonstrate this with 19F&#8594;13C INEPT (insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer) spectra of the drug flutrimazole at 13C natural abundance, where quaternary carbons become readily detectable, opening perspectives for accelerated NMR on fluorinated drugs or small molecules. The results are corroborated by a theoretical analysis of 19F OE&#8208;DNP coupling factors.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Ultrarigid Chiral Styrenes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Unconventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Cyclization/Carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
Atroposelective synthesis of ultrastable chiral styrenes: An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;enynes to configurationally ultrastable axially chiral styrenes was reported for the first time. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating various nucleophiles, including alcohols, water, and amines, to access diverse axially chiral styrene&#8208;based esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. Mechanistic studies revealed an unexpected Pd&#8211;hydride&#8208;triggered 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway.








Abstract
Axially chiral styrenes represent a promising class of atropisomers with broad potential in asymmetric catalysis, drug discovery, and materials science. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains underdeveloped due to the conformational flexibility and inherently low rotational barriers. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;enynes that enables efficient access to a series of configurationally ultrastable axially chiral styrenes in good to high yields (up to 88%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.5/0.5&#160;er). Key to success is the strategic design of an ortho&#8208;alkyne&#8208;substituted styrene substrate that favors olefin&#8208;first Pd&#8211;hydride insertion, followed by unconventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization and carbonylation. This protocol exhibits broad nucleophile compatibility, including alcohols, water, and amines, enabling the modular synthesis of diverse chiral styrene&#8208;based esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. The resulting conformationally rigid product was further transformed into an axially chiral monophosphine ligand, which demonstrated high efficiency in asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic investigations support a Pd&#8211;hydride insertion&#8211;cyclization&#8211;carbonylation sequence. This transformation provides a powerful platform for the asymmetric synthesis and application of axially chiral styrenes.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Allenylic Fluorides Enabled by Multiple Radical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric multiple&#8208;radical sorting strategy enables the synthesis of axially chiral allenylic fluorides from 1,3&#8208;enynes, fluoroiodomethane, and alkyl bromides. The protocol shows broad functional group tolerance and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, providing an efficient platform for constructing fluorine&#8208;containing axial chirality.








Abstract
Here, we disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, three&#8208;component asymmetric radical sorting strategy that enables the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral allenylic fluorides from readily available 1,3&#8208;enynes, fluoroiodomethane, and alkyl bromides. This radical protocol proceeds under mild, reductive conditions, accommodates a broad range of functional groups, including those found in complex bioactive molecules, and demonstrates high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. A previously unrecognized fluorine effect proved essential in dictating both reactivity and stereocontrol in this multicomponent radical coupling. This discovery establishes an efficient protocol for enantioselective multiple radical sorting and provides a modular platform for the catalytic synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing axial chirality.

         <title>Donor&#8722;&#960;&#8722;Acceptor Conjugated Polymeric Photocatalyst for Efficient Deep Oxidation of NO Facilitated by Strong Asymmetric Local Electric Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymeric catalyst by covalently incorporating ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets with &#960;&#8211;pyrene&#8211;&#960; molecules displayed strong asymmetric local electric field, which enables facilitated exciton dissociation, accelerated charge transfer kinetics, and offers dual adsorption sites for capture O2 and NO for highly selective and deep photocatalytic oxidization of NO at ppb levels to NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration NOx into NO3&#8722; is limited by strong exciton effects, rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, and lack of localized bonding sites of oxygen species in catalysts. Directed enrichment of charge carriers and reactants (O2 and NO) at active sites is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance photocatalytic NO removal. Herein, a donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) conjugated polymeric catalyst was engineered by covalently incorporating ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets with electron&#8208;donating &#960;&#8211;pyrene&#8211;&#960; molecules, which achieves an exceptional 82.2% NO elimination and 94.9% selectivity toward ionic products (NO3&#8722; sel. of 75.9%) with stable operation over 1000 mins, outperforming the previously reported carbon nitride photocatalysts. Rapidly reduces NO levels below safe concentration in a simulated environment chamber was also achieved. The generated asymmetric local electric field in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A conjugated polymeric catalyst through intramolecular charge transfer between electron&#8208;accepting heptazine rings and electron&#8208;donating pyrene units facilitates exciton dissociation, accelerating charge transfer kinetics, and offer dual adsorption sites for capture O2 and NO, thus favoring the O2 activation for highly selective oxidization of NO to NO3&#8722;. This work highlights the pivotal role of asymmetric local electric fields in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architectures for advancing efficient photocatalytic NO oxidation.

         <title>Reversible Zn2+&#8208;Activated Channel Transport Through Monomer&#8208;Dimer Interconversion of Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological Zn2+&#8208;gated channels, we developed a [2]rotaxane&#8208;based artificial ion channel. It features a K+&#8208;transporting sliding ring and a terpyridine unit that enables reversible Zn2+&#8208;dependent switching between carrier and channel states, offering a novel design for gated biomimetic transporters.








Abstract
Inspired by natural ligand&#8208;gated ion channels, artificial counterparts are of great interest for understanding biological transport mechanisms and developing bioinspired functional systems. Here, we report a Zn2+&#8208;activated artificial ion channel from a [2]rotaxane. Its key components are: i) a sliding bis(benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) unit for K&#8314; transport and ii) a Zn2+&#8208;responsive terpyridine thread that provides gating control. The monomeric rotaxane functions as an inactive carrier, whereas Zn2+&#8208;induced dimerization triggers a switch to a highly efficient channel transport mode. This transition is fully reversible with Zn2+ and competitive ligands. As the first biomimetic Zn2+&#8208;gated artificial ion channel, this work provides a novel design strategy for ligand&#8208;regulated transmembrane transporters.

This work presents a new approach to access silyl radicals via pyridines&#8208;promoted reductive activation of chlorosilanes using magnesium, and demonstrates its application in the reductive cross&#8208;coupling with benzyl, allyl, and propargyl ethers, providing an efficient and step&#8208;economical route for synthesizing diverse benzyl&#8208;, allyl&#8208;, and allenylsilanes. 








Abstract
The development of efficient approaches mediated by silyl radicals for constructing C&#9472;Si bonds is of great interest and importance, yet methods to generate these intermediates from readily available chlorosilanes remain scarce. Herein, we report a new strategy for silyl radical generation via pyridines&#8208;promoted reductive Si&#9472;Cl activation of chlorosilanes and demonstrate its application in the reductive cross&#8208;coupling with a wide array of benzyl, allyl, and propargyl alcohol derivatives. This protocol offers an efficient and step&#8208;economical route for the synthesis of diverse benzyl&#8208;, allyl&#8208;, and allenylsilanes, featuring broad substrate scope and easy scalability. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the coupling reaction was initiated by the reductive Si&#9472;Cl activation of chlorosilanes with magnesium promoted by pyridine derivatives, which generates silyl radicals. These silyl radicals subsequently mediate the deoxygenation of alcohol derivatives to form carbon radicals, culminating in C&#9472;Si radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component Dearomative Coupling of Bromoarenes: Modular Construction of Terpenoid Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, enantioselective three&#8208;component dearomative coupling of bromoarenes, silyldiazomethane, and malonates has been developed. This method employs a newly designed chiral ligand to efficiently construct 1,4&#8208;disubstituted hydrogenated naphthalenes, providing a concise and versatile strategy for the synthesis of terpenoid natural products. 








Abstract
We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component coupling of bromoarenes, diazoalkanes, and malonates. It represents a significant advancement in catalytic enantioselective dearomative 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated arenes. A palladium catalyst of a novel phosphoramidite enables a domino reaction consisting of enantiofacial aryl insertion of a bound diazoalkane and regioselective and stereospecific allylic substitution. The new reaction was readily applied in short total syntheses of three terpenoids, including (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene, (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocadalin, and (&#8722;)&#8208;odongrossin C. Mechanistic studies establish that stereocontrol arises from a concerted aryl migration/N2 extrusion, which forms the key cyclic &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate. The C4&#8208;regioselectivity of the malonate attack is governed by a combination of ligand effects, silyl group sterics, and stabilizing noncovalent interactions between the naphthyl ring and sodium malonate.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of Solution&#8208;Inaccessible Single&#8208;Site Cu(I) in a Molecular Titanium&#8211;Oxo Cage for Efficient Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular titanium&#8211;oxide cage, Ti16O24Bz24 (Bz = benzoate), featuring a &#8764;1 nm internal cavity and a hydrophobic Bz ligand shell, is developed to encapsulate a spatially confined Cu+ single&#8208;atom site, enabling the Ti16Cu2 catalyst to achieve high activity and selectivity for photoelectrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722;. 








Abstract
We introduce a precisely engineered molecular titanium&#8208;oxo cage, Ti16O24Bz24 (denoted as Ti16; Bz = C6H5CO2), designed to host a spatially confined Cu+ single&#8208;atom site, that enables efficient and selective C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and NO3&#8722; under photo&#8208;electrocatalytic (PEC) conditions, providing a molecular&#8208;level blueprint for multi&#8208;reactant coupling catalysis. Ti16 features a large internal cavity assembled from TiO6 octahedra shielded by a hydrophobic benzoate shell. Metalation of Ti16 with CuCl2/NaBH4 incorporates Cu+ ions, displacing encapsulated H3O+ and enabling the synthesis of Ti16Cux (x = 0.25&#8211;8). Among the Ti16Cux series, Ti16Cu2 demonstrates optimal performance under PEC conditions, achieving a high urea yield of 20 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 85% and a selectivity of 62% at &#8722;0.6 V versus RHE, outperforming most reported Cu&#8208;based systems. Spectroscopic and structural analyses reveal that C&#9472;N bond formation occurs via coupling of *CO and *NO species at the confined Cu sites, highlighting the essential role of the molecular cage in stabilizing reactive species and facilitating their interaction. This work establishes cage&#8208;like metal&#8211;oxo clusters as an atomically precise and versatile molecular platform for developing highly selective single&#8208;atom catalysts for challenging multi&#8208;reactant coupling reactions.

         <title>A Band&#8208;Orientation Co&#8208;Anchoring Strategy for the Design of a High&#8208;Performance Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A band&#8208;orientation co&#8208;anchoring strategy is proposed for the rational design of high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. A new mid&#8208;infrared NLO Rb3ZnV4O12Br crystal was successfully obtained by integrating d0&#8208;TM tetrahedral [VO4] into the KBBF design platform, which exhibits a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation effect, high laser damage threshold, wide bandgap, broad transmission window, moderate birefringence and favorable growth habit.








Abstract
Mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals have long been pursued, yet the realization of a balance among key performance metrics remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a band&#8208;orientation co&#8208;anchoring strategy to precisely regulate the band structures and module spatial arrangement for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MIR NLO crystals. Leveraging the deep&#8208;ultraviolet NLO KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) as a template, a novel MIR NLO Rb3ZnV4O12Br (RZVB) crystal was successfully obtained through multimodule substitution. Importantly, the tailored tetrahedral hybridization mode effectively anchors the conduction band minimum&#8212;dominated by d0 cations&#8212;at a higher energy level and suppresses d&#8211;d transitions. Concurrently, structural confinement within the KBBF&#8208;derived lattice enforces the optimal alignment of distorted tetrahedra. Furthermore, RZVB displays an unprecedented second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement mechanism, arising from a unique cross&#8208;module electron transfer. Consequently, RZVB exhibits superior linear and NLO performances, including a wide bandgap (3.25&#160;eV), high laser threshold damage (1.07 GW/cm2@1064&#160;nm), broad transmission window (0.382&#8211;7.6 &#181;m), moderate birefringence (0.06@589.3&#160;nm) and the strongest SHG response (7.7&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP@1064&#160;nm and 1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;AGS@2.09 &#181;m) among vanadates with bandgap exceeding 3&#160;eV. This work presents a high&#8208;performance MIR NLO crystal and establishes a bottom&#8208;up, broadly applicable design paradigm for the tailored development of next&#8208;generation crystalline materials.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Catalytic Asymmetric Lower&#8208;Rim Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes (ICCs) were synthesized via asymmetric lower&#8208;rim functionalization. In this approach, chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) organocatalysis, with vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) serving as pivotal intermediates, enables stepwise asymmetric halo&#8208;cyclization. A diverse library of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes featuring multiple C&#9472;C axial stereogenic axes with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities is obtained.








Abstract
We report herein an efficient approach for the enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes (ICCs) via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed lower&#8208;rim asymmetric functionalization. With vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) as the key intermediates, a stepwise asymmetric halo&#8208;cyclization strategy was applied to construct diverse inherently chiral calix[4]arenes bearing multiple C&#9472;C axially stereogenic elements with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 96% ee, all d.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1). The obtained lower&#8208;rim functionalized products underwent further photocatalytic transformations to access novel inherently chiral naphthofuran&#8208;based calix[4]arene architectures. Further synthetic modifications and analysis of their photophysical/chiroptical properties demonstrated their potential in optoelectronic materials and related fields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds via a stepwise process, with the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step occurring in the first VQMs&#8208;mediated cyclization, and the second step constituting a chiral transfer process.

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Anchoring Stabilized Copper Single Sites with Cavity&#8208;Enhanced Mass Transport for Acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;anchored copper (CB[6]&#8208;Cu) is reported as a stable single&#8208;site catalyst, achieving a 95.39% Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (EAH). The single&#8208;Cu&#8208;site and adjacent cavity structure facilitates optimal reactant coverage and disrupted hydrogen bonding, suppressing side reactions. The general applicability of this strategy is shown with CB[6]&#8208;Co for hydroxylamine synthesis.








Abstract
Controlling mass transfer and adsorption in single&#8208;site catalysts is critical for the activity and selectivity of heterogeneous electrocatalytic hydrogenation, but structural fragility at large current densities (&#8805;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) makes their practical application challenging. Here, taking acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4) as an example, cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;coordinated copper (CB[6]&#8208;Cu) is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to be the desired carbonyl&#8208;anchoring isolated Cu site with engineered mass transport. CB[6]&#8208;Cu demonstrates an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 95.4% for C2H4, which significantly suppresses the competitive coupling and hydrogen evolution reactions at 300&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a turnover frequency of 2.91 s&#8722;1 and 65&#160;h of continuous stable operation. The distinctive C2H2 adsorption configuration and broken hydrogen bond network are revealed to result in optimal coverage and a sufficient supply of C2H2 feedstocks, accounting for the remarkable C2H4 performance. The extended CB[6]&#8208;Co also exhibits enhanced NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH electrosynthesis performance, highlighting its potential.

Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction of homoallylic amides with phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) under Pd(II) catalysis delivers 6&#8208;acetoxylated 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazines through the formation of one C&#9472;C and two C&#9472;O bonds.








Abstract
We report a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory triple functionalization of terminal alkenes. The reaction of homoallylic amides with phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) under Pd(II) catalysis delivers 6&#8208;acetoxylated 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazines through the formation of one C&#9472;C and two C&#9472;O bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest a sequence involving oxypalladation, oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), a 1,2&#8208;alkyl(aryl)/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement (DR), and subsequent acetoxylation. While Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis with PIDA as the oxidant has enabled numerous powerful transformations, the DR reported here is unprecedented.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Heteroleptic Metallacages for Enhanced Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design of porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages that mediate directional photoinduced electron transfer for efficient confined photocatalysis. One of the metallacages, constructed via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly, incorporate electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine ligands that enhance charge separation and superoxide generation, leading to improved photocatalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates.








Abstract
The rational design of supramolecular architectures capable of mediating directional photoinduced electron transfer (PET) remains a central challenge in confined photocatalysis. Herein, we report two porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages, constructed via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, for the visible light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates. Both metallacages feature well&#8208;defined, positively charged cavities that enable selective substrate encapsulation and efficient catalytic turnover. In particular, one metallacage incorporates electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine units that engage in directional interligand PET with the porphyrin moieties, as supported by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This intramolecular PET promotes long&#8208;lived charge separation and enhances superoxide anion generation, resulting in markedly improved photocatalytic activity compared to control systems lacking donor&#8211;acceptor motifs. This study demonstrates a modular strategy for integrating electron donor and acceptor functionalities within a single supramolecular scaffold and highlights the potential of PET&#8208;enhanced cage&#8208;based photocatalysis, providing a versatile platform for sustainable light&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <title>Carbonothioate&#8208;Triggered Cascade Cyclization Enables High&#8208;Specificity Fluorescence Imaging of Hydrogen Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonothioate&#8208;triggered cascade cyclization strategy enabled near&#8208;infrared probe CTP&#8208;8 for highly selective hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn) sensing. It achieves first&#8208;ever imaging of H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant live cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. The trigger is adaptable to diverse phenolic hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores, providing a modular platform for future probes.








Abstract
Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn; n&#160;&gt;&#160;1) are critical redox signaling molecules. While the biological functions of H2Sn have received much attention, their exact action mechanisms are still poorly understood due to the lack of reliable detection methods. In this context, fluorescent probes for H2Sn are emerging as powerful chemical tools to aid in unraveling its contributions to biology. Currently, most available H2Sn probes are prone to interference from biothiols or hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this challenge, herein, we report a unique carbonothioate&#8208;based trigger utilizing a cascade cyclization reaction for specific detection of H2Sn. Using this strategy, eight new fluorescent probes (CTP 1&#8211;8) were prepared and evaluated. Among them, CTP&#8208;8 not only enables highly sensitive and selective detection of H2Sn but also allows visualization of H2Sn fluctuations in living cells and mice. Significantly, we demonstrate for the first time the fluorescence imaging of endogenous H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Besides, this carbonothioate&#8208;based trigger could also be potentially utilized in other fluorescent dye scaffolds that possess an optically tunable phenolic hydroxyl group. This work provides a useful approach for further investigations of H2Sn biology as well as future probe development.

&lt;p&gt;A carbonothioate-triggered cascade cyclization strategy enabled near-infrared probe CTP-8 for highly selective hydrogen polysulfides (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) sensing. It achieves first-ever imaging of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; dynamics in insulin-resistant live cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. The trigger is adaptable to diverse phenolic hydroxyl-containing fluorophores, providing a modular platform for future probes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen polysulfides (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;; n&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;1) are critical redox signaling molecules. While the biological functions of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; have received much attention, their exact action mechanisms are still poorly understood due to the lack of reliable detection methods. In this context, fluorescent probes for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are emerging as powerful chemical tools to aid in unraveling its contributions to biology. Currently, most available H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; probes are prone to interference from biothiols or hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). To address this challenge, herein, we report a unique carbonothioate-based trigger utilizing a cascade cyclization reaction for specific detection of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Using this strategy, eight new fluorescent probes (&lt;b&gt;CTP 1&#8211;8&lt;/b&gt;) were prepared and evaluated. Among them, &lt;b&gt;CTP-8&lt;/b&gt; not only enables highly sensitive and selective detection of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; but also allows visualization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuations in living cells and mice.

         <title>Superatomic or Not? A Case Study on Isostructural Au3Ag2 and Au3Cu2 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

Two isostructural nanoclusters, [Au3Ag2(Ppy3)6](NO3)3 (Au3Ag2) and [Au3Cu2(Ppy3)6](BF4)3 (Au3Cu2), are synthesized, and they demonstrate different stability. Calculations show that Au3Ag2 is the smallest well&#8208;defined superatom, while Au3Cu2 with identical electron count is nonsuperatomic. This contrast underscores how doping governs electronic structures and stability, offering new insights into the superatom model.








Abstract
Two bimetal nanoclusters, [Au3Ag2(Ppy3)6](NO3)3 (Au3Ag2) and [Au3Cu2(Ppy3)6](BF4)3 (Au3Cu2) have been synthesized with tri(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (Ppy3). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that both have trigonal bipyramidal structures with three Au atoms at the waist and Ag/Cu atoms at the top and bottom vertices. Au3Ag2 demonstrates much better stability than Au3Cu2 in solution. Theoretical calculations indicate that Au3Ag2 is the smallest well&#8208;defined superatom while Au3Cu2 is nonsuperatomic, even though they are isostructural and have the same number of valence electrons. This work highlights the influence of atom doping on the electronic structures and superatomic properties of metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Rotor&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Various Interpenetrated Degrees/Modes Featuring Tunable Porosity/Stability for Binary/Ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 Separation</title>

Molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;engineered MOFs with various interpenetrated degrees/modes enable precise modulation of porosity/stability. Among them, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb and Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn exhibit improved C2H2 uptake, while Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan shows rotor&#8208;driven stimuli&#8208;responsive gating effect at 195&#160;K. Breakthrough experiments confirm Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb achieves one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90, v/v/v) mixture with new benchmark productivity.








Abstract
Efficient separation of challenging acetylene/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) and acetylene/carbon dioxide (C2H2/CO2) mixtures is crucial for the chemical industry. Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold significant promise for separating complex gas mixtures but often face a trade&#8208;off between porosity and stability. Herein, three different entangled degrees and modes of MOFs, namely Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn, and Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan, were yielded by the crystal engineering strategy using molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;based co&#8208;ligands (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups) to systematically modulate their porosity and stability. As expected, the stable Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb/Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn achieve enhanced porosity (27.2%/32.1%) and improved C2H2 uptake (73.9/75.8 cm3 g&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, 100&#160;kPa). Interestingly, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan exhibits the unique rotor&#8208;driven gating effect with free bpan ligands, facilitating the pressure&#8208;dependent switching between nonporous (10.8%) and open states at 195&#160;K. Breakthrough experiments confirm excellent C2H2 separation performance from binary/ternary mixtures and achieve one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 (&gt;99.9%) from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90, v/v/v) mixture with a new benchmark productivity of 396.9&#160;L kg&#8722;1 (Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb). Theoretical calculations and in situ IR spectra reveal that C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separation are primarily governed by the abundant C&#9472;H&#8943;O/N and C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; interactions. This study establishes a molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;engineered approach to precisely modulate interpenetration in MOFs and offers a robust platform for high&#8208;performance gas purification.

         <title>Synthesis of Type II Porous Liquids from Nonporous Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra Enhanced by Host&#8211;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II porous liquids with record&#8208;high cage&#8208;content. This strategy synergistically increases the solubility of MOP&#8208;18 and prevents the interpenetration of n&#8208;dodecyl chains into cage cavities, enabling the transition MOP&#8208;18 from nonporous in the solid state to porous in the liquid state for gas separation.








Abstract
The synthesis of Type II porous liquids (PLs) from metal&#8211;organic polyhedra, a kind of excellent porous molecular sources, suffers from their strong crystallization tendency induced poor solubility. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II PLs from MOPs with record&#8208;high concentration. Benefitting from host&#8211;guest interactions between pillar[5]arene and n&#8208;alkyl chains, a Type II PL (P5&#8208;PL) is developed by dissolving apolar n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOP&#8208;18) in polar liquid pillar[5]arene (P5&#8208;L), exhibiting solubility much higher than all MOP&#8208;based Type II PLs reported to date. MOP&#8208;18, being nonporous in the solid state because of molecular packing&#8208;induced pore blockage, displays permanent molecular porosity when molecularly and randomly dispersed in P5&#8208;L to form P5&#8208;PL, as confirmed by experimental and simulation results. P5&#8208;PL demonstrates excellent CO2/N2 separation capabilities, enabling the fabrication of mixed matrix membrane with superior CO2/N2 selectivity. This strategy can be extended to the fabrication of additional Type II PLs, showing its universality. This synergistic design concept integrating supramolecular chemistry with PLs not only overcomes traditional tedious covalent modification but also enables high compatibility between apolar cage solutes and polar solvents, affording PLs with high porosity, low volatility and viscosity, and programmable tunability.

     alt="Synthesis of Type II Porous Liquids from Nonporous Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra Enhanced by Host&#8211;Guest Complexation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II porous liquids with record-high cage-content. This strategy synergistically increases the solubility of MOP-18 and prevents the interpenetration of &lt;i&gt;n-&lt;/i&gt;dodecyl chains into cage cavities, enabling the transition MOP-18 from nonporous in the solid state to porous in the liquid state for gas separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of Type II porous liquids (PLs) from metal&#8211;organic polyhedra, a kind of excellent porous molecular sources, suffers from their strong crystallization tendency induced poor solubility. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II PLs from MOPs with record-high concentration. Benefitting from host&#8211;guest interactions between pillar[5]arene and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl chains, a Type II PL (P5-PL) is developed by dissolving apolar &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-dodecyl-functionalized metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOP-18) in polar liquid pillar[5]arene (P5-L), exhibiting solubility much higher than all MOP-based Type II PLs reported to date. MOP-18, being nonporous in the solid state because of molecular packing-induced pore blockage, displays permanent molecular porosity when molecularly and randomly dispersed in P5-L to form P5-PL, as confirmed by experimental and simulation results. P5-PL demonstrates excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation capabilities, enabling the fabrication of mixed matrix membrane with superior CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. This strategy can be extended to the fabrication of additional Type II PLs, showing its universality. This synergistic design concept integrating supramolecular chemistry with PLs not only overcomes traditional tedious covalent modification but also enables high compatibility between apolar cage solutes and polar solvents, affording PLs with high porosity, low volatility and viscosity, and programmable tunability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inverting Palladium&#8211;Phosphorus Lewis Pair Formation: Phosphonium Acting as Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic phosphonium&#8208;palladium(0) complexes were synthesized using an ambiphilic phosphorus&#8208;based ligand. A strong Z&#8208;type interaction was identified by DFT calculations (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM analyses), surpassing the strength of classical L&#8208;type P&#9472;Pd bonds. The pronounced Pd(0) stabilization facilitates mild P&#9472;C coupling reaction, showcasing the effect of Z&#8208;type ligands on reductive elimination in transition metal mediated transformations. 








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based ligands are prototypical L&#8208;type donors. Here, we introduce a Lewis acidic phosphonium cation that engages in unprecedented Z&#8208;type coordination to palladium(0). The resulting Pd&#8594;P(V) interactions are structurally unique and stronger than conventional L&#8208;type Pd&#9472;phosphine bonds, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, x&#8208;ray crystallography, and quantum chemical analyses (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM). It enables the formation of rare L2Z&#8208;type Pd(0) complexes with distinctive optical and electronic properties. A notably mild P&#9472;C bond forming reaction suggests an overlooked role of Z&#8208;type interactions for facilitating reductive elimination pathways.

         <title>Design and Structural Transformations of Zinc(II) Knotted Cage Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic control over coordination environments and subcomponent sequences enabled the formation and stabilization of trefoil perplexanes and trefoil tetrahedral knotted cages. Peripheral crosslinkers diminished framework stability to tune host&#8211;guest behavior and dynamic exchange, while mechanical entanglement modulated self&#8208;sorting and guest binding, offering routes to future functional designs. 








Abstract
Interwoven architectures feature in biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, the high&#8208;yielding syntheses and controlled structural transformations of artificial interwoven structures, particularly those exhibiting intricate topologies and bifurcated strands, remain a challenge. In this study, we present a rational design strategy that harnesses the rigidity of tailored ligands in combination with zinc coordination to direct the self&#8208;assembly process, thus enabling the controlled synthesis of covalently linked trefoil perplexane and trefoil tetrahedral knotted cage frameworks. We further elucidate the role of structural rigidity in governing framework transformations, demonstrating two&#8208;way interconversion between interwoven and non&#8208;interwoven architectures, accompanied by tunable guest encapsulation and release. Notably, the incorporation of peripheral crosslinkers was found to lock the cage conformation, thereby regulating its guest binding properties. In addition, the sequence of subcomponent addition was found to be critical to the product outcome: Initial construction of a covalently&#8208;linked knotted cage framework stabilizes kinetic intermediates during self&#8208;assembly, providing access to distinct products.

         <title>A Synergistic Cu/Ca Dual&#8208;Doping Strategy for High&#8208;Stability and Fast&#8208;Charging O3&#8208;Type Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu2+/Ca2+ doped&#160;O3&#8208;type oxide Na0.98Ca0.01Ni0.35Cu0.05Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (CuCa&#8211;NFM) was designed as a cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Cu2+ facilitates Na+ diffusion and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, whereas Ca2+ pillars restrain phase transition. The CuCa&#8208;NFM cathode displays a high&#8208;rate capacity of 86.02 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles.








Abstract
The O3&#8208;type layered oxide cathodes are highly promising for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interlayer stability caused by narrow layer spacing and volumetric stress accumulation limit their fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;cycle performance. Herein, targeted interlayer regulation is conducted on O3&#8208;type layered oxide by introducing Cu2+ and Ca2+ into the transition metal (TM) and alkali metal (AM) layers, respectively. The introduction of Cu2+ effectively enlarges sodium&#8208;ion transport channels, mitigates oxygen arrangement around TM octahedra, and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, which is evidenced by scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Additionally, Ca2+ in the AM layer effectively mitigates volume variation during electrochemical reactions and preserves structural integrity, as confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, resulting in lower lattice stress and mitigated phase evolution. The result is an exceptionally high&#8208;rate capability of 86.02&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C (2.4&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), accompanied by a prolonged lifetime with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles. This work demonstrates synergistic regulation of ion transport and lattice stability, providing new insights for cathode design.

         <title>Construction of Tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Phosphine Oxides via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrophosphinylation of Dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and general method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;amido and 2&#8208;alkoxyl dienes is developed. This approach facilitates the expedited and straightforward construction of chiral allylic &#945;&#8208;amino and &#945;&#8208;alkoxyphosphine oxides with tetrasubstituted carbon centers. Both 2&#8208;amido diene and 2&#8208;alkoxyl diene served as excellent coupling partners with a wide range of phosphine oxides.








Abstract
Significant progress has been made in the asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of dienes to construct vinylic stereogenic carbon centers. However, achieving enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of substituted dienes with heteroatom nucleophiles to form vinylic tetrasubstituted carbon centers remains a formidable challenge. This difficulty arises primarily from issues of regio&#8208;control, steric hindrance, and stereo&#8208;discrimination. In this study, we present a palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;amido and 2&#8208;alkoxyl dienes using phosphine oxides. This approach successfully constructs chiral allylic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphine oxides and &#945;&#8208;alkoxyphosphine oxides with tetrasubstituted carbon centers. Our method demonstrates a broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and high yields (up to 99%), achieving exclusive regio&#8208;control under mild conditions. Additionally, the versatile post&#8208;functionalization of the allyl group facilitates the synthesis of a wide variety of tetrasubstituted carbon centers featuring distinct heteroatom.

Additionally, the versatile post-functionalization of the allyl group facilitates the synthesis of a wide variety of tetrasubstituted carbon centers featuring distinct heteroatom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Polymerization and Pre&#8208;Etching Dominated by Carbon Dots to Fabricate the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Microporous Carbon for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) are used as the sole self&#8208;template to produce sub&#8208;nanometer microporous carbon with high packing density, large specific surface area (SSA), high yield, and high micropore area ratio, which challenges the conventional understanding of porous carbon synthesis and establishes CDs as a key member in the self&#8208;template family.








Abstract
The self&#8208;templating method is a facile and low&#8208;cost strategy to synthesize porous carbon materials, but the obtained products usually have low yields, limited specific surface areas (SSAs), and broad pore size distributions. It is a great challenge for the self&#8208;templating method to prepare the sub&#8208;nanometer (0.5&#8211;1.0&#160;nm) microporous carbon that is preferred for high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) are employed as the sole precursor to prepare porous carbon without using any activating agents. The obtained carbon materials have large SSA (2733.6 m2 g&#8722;1), high micropore area ratio (92.5%), high packing density (0.82&#160;g cm&#8722;3), high yield (12%), and concentrated sub&#8208;nanometer pore structure. The formation mechanism of such porous carbon and the unique functions of CDs as self&#8208;templates are interpreted by various characterizations. When used as electrodes for supercapacitors, this carbon material exhibits specific capacitance up to 639 F g&#8722;1 and is compatible with electrolytes of wide pH values and enlarged voltage windows (1.3&#8211;1.7&#160;V). The symmetric devices assembled by such material exhibit low self&#8208;discharge behaviors, excellent energy densities (15.9&#8211;44.1&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and good cycling performance even under the commercial&#8208;level mass loading (10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) on electrodes.

         <title>Discriminative Peroxymonosulfate Activation on Iron Carbides for Redox&#8208;Neutral Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds featured with moderate electron delocalization regulates peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation pathway and preserves the Fe valence state, affecting the contribution of radical pathway and electron&#8208;connection between PMS and phenol, thereby achieving high catalytic activity with exceptional stability. This study introduces a new paradigm for Fenton&#8208;like processes in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
In conventional redox cycle&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes, the imbalanced rates between the reductive activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the subsequent catalyst recovery by PMS oxidation often leads to the catalyst deactivation, posing a major challenge to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we report a discriminative, redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation pathway enabled by a core&#8211;shell Fe3C@C catalyst, which eliminates performance loss caused by such redox imbalance. Covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds within Fe3C@C suppress complete electron transfer for PMS oxidation or reduction, preventing the radical&#8208;forming pathways. Instead, PMS is activated through electronic induction, discriminatively cleaving the peroxyl O&#9472;O bond to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) as the sole reactive oxygen species (ROS) without significant changes in the Fe valence state, thereby greatly enhancing catalyst durability. Beyond PMS activation, the highly conductive Fe3C@C network serves as an efficient electron relay, promoting pollutant degradation with 1O2 by facilitating electron&#8208;exchange between PMS and pollutant. By integrating redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation with electron&#8208;connection driven pollutant oxidation, Fe3C@C achieves both high reactivity and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, overcoming the traditional trade&#8208;off between activity and durability. This work introduces a new paradigm in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis, demonstrating how covalent coordination engineering can unlock selective, nonradical pathways for sustainable and robust water treatment.

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Glasses Enabled by Frustrated Non&#8208;Covalent Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated noncovalent complexation has been developed as an effective route to tough supramolecular glasses, by installing steric isopropyl groups adjacent to directional squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. Compared with a nonfrustrated control, the frustrated design increases mechanical toughness by 4.3&#8208;fold and enhances interfacial adhesion, enabling the resulting supramolecular glasses to function as impact&#8208;resistant coatings. 








Abstract
Supramolecular glasses, as noncovalently cross&#8208;linked amorphous materials, are hampered by a fundamental trade&#8208;off between vitrification and mechanical performance. Here we propose a strategy&#8212;&#8220;frustrated non&#8208;covalent complexation&#8221;&#8212;inspired by frustrated Lewis pairs to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by installing sterically hindering isopropyl groups adjacent to directional squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. Relative to a nonfrustrated control, this design not only generates more loosely packed hydrogen&#8208;bonded domains but also shifts the dominant interactions from squaramide&#8211;squaramide to squaramide&#8211;ester hydrogen bonding. The frustrated system yields a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in mechanical toughness in the resulting supramolecular glass, facilitated by efficient energy dissipation through reversible hydrogen&#8208;bond rupture. It also enhances interfacial adhesion, functioning as an effective impact&#8208;resistant coating that mitigates substrate fracture. Overall, this work establishes frustrated noncovalent complexation as a powerful paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance supramolecular glass materials.

         <title>Breaking Interference&#8208;Driven Reversal Currents to Boost Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cross&#8208;conjugated single&#8208;molecule systems, the presence of destructive quantum interference leads to low conductivity, which is accompanied by the presence of reversal currents. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically enhance conductance in cross&#8208;conjugated systems by preventing reversal current formation, achieving two orders of magnitude increase in conductance. 








Abstract
Controlling charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions is essential for advancing molecular electronics. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically enhance conductance in cross&#8208;conjugated systems by preventing reversal current formation in destructive quantum interference (DQI) regimes. We design four molecules with meta&#8208;substituted phenyl rings replaced by hydrogen&#8208;bonded diketone (OHO) or boron&#8208;coordinated rings (NBN, NBO, OBO), all maintaining hexagonal cross&#8208;conjugated topology. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a counterintuitive conductance enhancement arising from suppressed reversal currents. Replacing the prototype m&#8208;phenyl ring (mPh) with diketone (OHO) elevates conductance by one order of magnitude. Further boron coordination synergistically modulates quantum interference and energy levels, achieving an unprecedented two orders of magnitude increase in conductance in OBO (from 10&#8722;5.39 G0 to 10&#8722;3.41 G0). This work establishes a paradigm for efficient conductance modulation via targeted reversal current suppression, enabling rationally designed quantum&#8208;interference molecular devices.

         <title>Repurposing Waste Chemicals to Engineer Redox Mediators for Selective Active Species Modulation in Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Systems</title>

This work presents a strategy for extracting an efficient catalyst from discarded chemical reagents to construct a photo&#8208;assisted oxidant activation system with customizable activation pathways. While enabling green and sustainable remediation of organic wastewater, this approach also holds promise for applications in selective CO2 reduction, selective H2O2 regeneration, and other high&#8208;value chemical transformations, fostering prosperity across multiple fields.








Abstract
Resource recovery from chemical wastes offers significant economic and environmental opportunities. In particular, repurposing recycled materials to construct light&#8208;driven oxidant activation systems presents a promising strategy for organic wastewater remediation. However, in such a photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system, precise regulation of active species remains a major challenge, limiting performance optimization. Here, we propose a sustainable approach using catalysts derived from deteriorated potassium iodide (KI) reagents. Theoretical analyses reveal that I&#8722; and I3&#8722; species from degraded KI function as effective redox mediators, generating internal electric fields that substantially lower energy barriers for carrier separation. The resulting catalytic system exhibits outstanding decontamination performance, achieving complete removal of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole with a pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of 0.79&#160;min&#8722;1, representing 3.76&#8208; and 79.00&#8208;fold enhancements over systems using standard KI and single&#8208;based catalysts, respectively. Mechanistic studies confirm the efficient utilization of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of singlet oxygen through non&#8208;radical pathways. Notably, this novel mechanism shows broad applicability across various oxidant activation systems, with the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator effectively modifying substrate electronic structures to enhance reactive oxidant interactions. This work introduces an innovative strategy for converting chemical wastes into high&#8208;value materials, advancing sustainable wastewater treatment, and opening new avenues for resource&#8208;efficient chemical applications.

Stable nor[7]circulenyl radical (nor[7]CR) is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline form. nor[7]CR exhibits a distinct four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, and the charged species are isolated and characterized. The stable cation (nor[7]CR+) exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption with a PCE of 93% and a high Tmax under low optical power density. The applications of nor[7]CR+ in photothermal imaging and laser ignition are demonstrated.








Abstract
[n]Circulenes have attracted considerable research interest; however, open&#8208;shell [n]circulene&#8208;type structures remain elusive. In this study, we report the synthesis of a highly stable nor[7]circulenyl radical (nor[7]CR) and its isolation in the crystalline phase. nor[7]CR exhibits a distinct four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. The stable cation (nor[7]CR+) was obtained via chemical oxidation and isolated in crystalline form, and the corresponding anionic species were characterized spectroscopically. Remarkably, nor[7]CR+ exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption at 1105&#160;nm with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 93%, as well as a high maximum photothermal temperature (Tmax) under low optical power density. The applications of nor[7]CR+ in photothermal imaging and laser ignition were demonstrated, highlighting its great potential as a photothermal material.

         <title>Precise Kinetic Separation of Hexane Isomers via Morphology Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Diffusion&#8208;Selective Pore Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;621 features a tailored diffusion&#8208;selective pore structure that enables intrinsic kinetic recognition of hexane isomers. Combined with synergistic crystal size engineering, it achieves precise and multi&#8208;objective separation of all C6 alkane isomers. 








Abstract
Hexane isomer separation is critical to advancing sustainable and high&#8208;value refining in the petrochemical industry. However, precise separation of multi&#8208;component hexane mixtures with similar molecular structures remains a bottleneck. Herein, we report a novel metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;3,3&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;SIFSIX, termed as ZU&#8208;621) featuring a tailored diffusion&#8208;selective pore structure, synergistically integrated with crystal size engineering, that enables precise and efficient separation of hexane isomers. Owing to the uniquely engineered dumbbell&#8208;shaped, misaligned electronegative pore environment, ZU&#8208;621 exhibits intrinsic kinetic discrimination among hexane isomers based on the alkyl spatial distribution. Complementary crystal morphology engineering further fine&#8208;tunes the adsorption&#8211;diffusion behavior, affording precise kinetic separation across linear, mono&#8208;branched, and di&#8208;branched isomer pairs. As a result, this kinetic&#8208;morphology synergistic approach achieved benchmark separation performance as evidenced by record gasoline productivity (research octane numbers, RON&#160;&gt;&#160;95, 49.8&#160;L&#160;kg&#8722;1) along with precise, multi&#8208;objective separation across five hexane isomers.

         <title>A Photoswitchable HaloTag for Spatiotemporal Control of Fluorescence in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable fluorophores are critical for advanced bioimaging. Here, we develop a photoswitchable self&#8208;labeling HaloTag that can reversibly modulate the emission of a bound fluorogenic dye via a light&#8208;induced conformational change. In living cells, this tunable chemigenetic system enables precise spatiotemporal activation and control of emitter density in SMLM.








Abstract
Photosensitive fluorophores, whose emission can be controlled using light, are essential for advanced biological imaging, enabling precise spatiotemporal tracking of molecular features and facilitating super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. Although irreversibly photoactivatable fluorophores are well established, reversible reporters that can be reactivated multiple times remain scarce, and only a few have been applied in living cells using generalizable protein labeling methods. To address these limitations, we introduce chemigenetic photoswitchable fluorophores, leveraging the self&#8208;labeling HaloTag protein with fluorogenic rhodamine dye ligands. By incorporating a light&#8208;responsive protein domain into HaloTag, we engineer a tunable, photoswitchable HaloTag (psHaloTag), which can reversibly modulate the fluorescence of a bound dye&#8208;ligand via a light&#8208;induced conformational change. Our best performing psHaloTag variants show excellent performance in living cells, with large, reversible, deep&#8208;red fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon 450&#160;nm illumination across various biomolecular targets and SMLM compatibility. Together, this work establishes the chemigenetic approach as a versatile platform for the design of photoswitchable reporters, tunable through both genetic and synthetic modifications, with promising applications for dynamic imaging.

         <title>Click&#8208;Cyclized Cell Penetrating Peptides Containing Hydrophobic Proline Derivatives for Efficient Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide featuring a modified aminoproline moiety that significantly enhances permeability is reported. The results demonstrate that a secondary amine linkage coupled with a hydrophobic substituent leads to better peptide permeability. This peptide successfully delivered EGFP into cells, offering a promising strategy for targeted protein transport and peptide drug development.








Abstract
Targeting intracellular organelles with macromolecules is challenging due to cell membrane impermeability. Innovative approaches to direct intracellular delivery have been developed, including nanoparticles, as a promising method for protein delivery; however, with limited efficiency. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) provide a versatile alternative for intracellular cargo delivery. We suggest substituting hydroxy&#8208; or amino prolines in &#946;&#8208;turns in cyclic CPPs with hydrophobic residues to facilitate cell penetration.

&lt;p&gt;A cyclic cell-penetrating peptide featuring a modified aminoproline moiety that significantly enhances permeability is reported. The results demonstrate that a secondary amine linkage coupled with a hydrophobic substituent leads to better peptide permeability. This peptide successfully delivered EGFP into cells, offering a promising strategy for targeted protein transport and peptide drug development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting intracellular organelles with macromolecules is challenging due to cell membrane impermeability. Innovative approaches to direct intracellular delivery have been developed, including nanoparticles, as a promising method for protein delivery; however, with limited efficiency. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) provide a versatile alternative for intracellular cargo delivery. We suggest substituting hydroxy- or amino prolines in &#946;-turns in cyclic CPPs with hydrophobic residues to facilitate cell penetration. We investigated the influence of substituted amine and ether derivatives of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-4-hydroxy- or amino-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-proline on MCF-7 and other cell lines for the import of the fluorophore ATOTA. Flow cytometry and spinning disk confocal microscopy on 17 linear and click-cyclic peptides revealed that particularly cyclic cell penetrating peptide &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; (cCPP &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited remarkable permeability. When conjugated with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), cCPP 15 efficiently delivered the protein into MCF-7 and HeLa cells. cCPP &lt;b&gt;15,&lt;/b&gt; comprising two endocyclic and two exocyclic &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-arginines and a trans amino-L-proline with a 2-naphthylmethylene modification in a typeII&#946;-turn, significantly enhanced intracellular penetration. The efficiency of cCPP &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; in intracellular delivery provides a valuable addition to the growing field of CPPs that can deliver macromolecules to the interior of the cell and possibly even cross the blood-brain barrier with proteins or drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Finding the Key: Binding of Metal&#8208;Oxo Clusters to the Enzyme Active Site Enabled by &#8220;Click&#8221; (Bio)Conjugation</title>

This work demonstrates targeted, site&#8208;specific binding of metal&#8208;oxo clusters to Hen Egg White Lysozyme through organic functionalization. Crystallographic analysis reveals Azide&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside&#8208;functionalized vanadate clusters accessing the enzyme's binding pocket, whereas hexyne&#8208;functionalized clusters do not promote interactions with the same site. This work demonstrates the utility of derivatizing inorganic clusters with organic moieties to facilitate targeted protein interactions.








Abstract
Molecular metal&#8208;oxo nanoclusters with tunable redox and structural properties have emerged as powerful bio&#8208;inorganic tools in catalysis, protein crystallization, and therapeutic applications. Despite their potential, interactions between discrete clusters and proteins are predominantly driven by nonspecific intermolecular interactions, which limit precise control over binding sites and functional outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new strategy to achieve site&#8208;directed binding of vanadium&#8208;based polyoxometalate clusters (POVs) to distinct regions of Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL), an archetypal antimicrobial enzyme. Three novel hybrid POVs were designed and fully characterized, starting from an azide&#8208;functionalized cluster (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;N3), which was subsequently post&#8208;functionalized with a hydrophobic hexyne group (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Hex) to probe nonpolar interactions, and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Man) to mimic the protein's natural substrate. Structural and spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that, in contrast to conventional nonhybrid POV clusters which bind nonspecifically to peripheral positively charged protein patches, the hybrid POVs achieve distinct binding behaviors. Specifically, Na&#8208;V6&#8208;N3 and Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Man selectively target the glycosidic pocket, resembling the binding of the protein's natural substrate, while Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Hex exhibits an unprecedented crystallization of two POV clusters in close proximity, which wrap around the protein surface. These findings highlight that strategic organic functionalization can circumvent electrostatic barriers to achieve site&#8208;selective cluster&#8211;protein interactions, thus opening new avenues for the application of metal&#8208;oxo clusters in biotechnology, drug delivery, and medicine.

         <title>The Parkinson's Disease Drug Tolcapone and Analogues are Potent Glycomimetic Lectin Inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LecA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present Tolcapone and derivatives as a new class of potent glycomimetics for lectin inhibition. Over 3200 Roche in&#8208;house compounds were screened experimentally and a subset was biophysically evaluated. Our findings show the potential to develop potent non&#8208;carbohydrate glycomimetic lectin inhibitors, opening a path toward innovative anti&#8208;infective drug research.








Abstract
The notorious pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa relies on the lectin LecA for host cell adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation. Motivated by the pressing need for new anti&#8208;infective therapies caused by antimicrobial resistance, inhibitors of LecA are under investigation. Complementary to the use of carbohydrate&#8208;based inhibitors, we have previously identified catechols as weak but specific ligands of LecA, constituting a novel class of non&#8208;carbohydrate glycomimetics. By growing the initial millimolar fragment hits, we identified Tolcapone as a promising compound. To gain insight into the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of catechols as LecA binders, more than 3,200 compounds of the Roche in&#8208;house library were experimentally screened in a competitive binding assay at three concentrations. Of these, 48 compounds were chosen for further investigation, resulting in compounds equipotent to aryl galactosides, the current epitome of LecA inhibition. X&#8208;ray crystallography and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy revealed conserved interactions of the catechol moiety in the glycan binding site of LecA and rationalized the observed SAR. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop potent non&#8208;carbohydrate glycomimetic lectin inhibitors. This work paves the way for a new avenue of research towards innovative anti&#8208;infective drugs. In a more general perspective, such small molecules also hold potential to challenge the hegemony of antibodies for lectin inhibition in clinical use.

         <title>Counteranion&#8208;Controlled Chemodivergent Transfer&#8208;Hydrothiolation/Carbothiolation Using Thioethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a counteranion&#8208;controlled Rh&#8208;catalytic system for the chemodivergent functionalization of alkenes via C(sp3)&#9472;S bond cleavage. The use of Rh(COD)2OTf promotes Markovnikov transfer&#8208;hydrothiolation. Alternatively, Rh(COD)2BF4 enables unprecedented intermolecular carbothiolation, where thioethers act as dual carbon and sulfur donors, forming both C(sp3)&#9472;S and C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds.








Abstract
The pursuit of catalysis capable of forging C(sp3)&#9472;S bonds is extremely desired because these bonds have substantial importance in pharmaceuticals, functional materials, and organic synthesis. Hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of feedstock alkenes are among the most straightforward and prominent approaches to C(sp3)&#9472;S bond formations. However, hydrothiolation of alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes typically proceeds in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion, and carbothiolation predominantly relies on three&#8208;component coupling strategies using highly reactive pre&#8208;functionalized electrophilic sulfur sources and nucleophilic carbon sources. Herein, by strategically using heterolytic cleavage of C(sp3)&#9472;S bond, we report a chemodivergent transfer&#8208;hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of alkenes with thioethers serving as bifunctional reagents. The chemo&#8208;control is achieved through careful selection of the counteranion associated with the Rh&#8208;center. Counteranions with relatively strong coordinating ability, such as TfO&#8722;, promote an unusual Markovnikov transfer&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reaction. Conversely, noncoordinating counteranions, such as BF4&#8722;, enable an unprecedented intermolecular thioether&#8208;ene reaction that adds thioethers directly across alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies elucidated that the coordination or noncoordination of counteranions on Rh can alter the basicity of the thiolate, resulting in chemodivergence.
