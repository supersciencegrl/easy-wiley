         <title>Stabilizing Hydrogen Radicals in Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt&#8208;Copper Mesoporous Nanoplates for Complete Nitrate Reduction Electrocatalysis to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional mesoporous CoCu nanoplates with confined microenvironment and alloyed composition were precisely designed for complete electrocatalysis of waster nitrate into value&#8208;added ammonia under a natural electrolyte. Thanks to unique physicochemical property, this electrocatalyst performed well with a lower energy consumption in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, which concurrently electrosynthesized ammonia from nitrate at cathode and 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural at anode.







Abstract
Ambient electrochemical reduction of waste nitrate (NO3&#8722;) represents an alternative green route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) electrosynthesis in water. Despites some encouraged achievements, sluggish eight electron and nine proton reduction routes that involve multi&#8208;step hydrogenation pathways have severely hindered their NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) and yield rate. Herein, we develop a robust two&#8208;dimensional mesoporous cobalt&#8208;copper (meso&#8208;CoCu) nanoplate electrocatalyst that delivers excellent performance of complete NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR), including superior FENH3 of 98.8&#8201;%, high NH3 yield rate of 3.39&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and energy efficiency of 49.8&#8201;%, and good cycling stability. Mechanism investigations unveil that active hydrogen (*H) radicals produced from water splitting on Co sites spillover to adjacent Cu sites and further stabilize within confined mesopores, which kinetically promote its coupling hydrogenation reactions of nitrogen intermediates and thus facilitate complete NO3RR for favorable NH3 electrosynthesis. Moreover, meso&#8208;CoCu nanoplates perform well as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system that concurrently synthesizes NH3 from NO3&#8722; at cathode and 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural at anode. This work in stabilizing *H radicals in mesoporous microenvironment provides some insights applied to various hydrogenation reactions for selective electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals in water.

         <title>Antimony Component Schottky Nanoheterojunctions as Ultrasound&#8208;Heightened Pyroptosis Initiators for Sonocatalytic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schottky nanoheterojunctions containing Sb component (Sb2Se3@Pt) are designed and constructed via in situ growth of Pt on Sb2Se3 semiconductor with narrow band gaps, which are utilized as US&#8208;heightened pyroptosis initiators to boost SCT&#8208;immunotherapy. The biological effects of Sb2Se3@Pt nanoheterojunction itself combined with sonocatalytic amplification of oxidative stress significantly induce Caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD&#8208;dependent pyroptosis in cancer cells to trigger antitumor immune responses.







Abstract
Pyroptosis, an inflammatory modality of programmed cell death associated with the immune response, can be initiated by bioactive ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, bioactive ion&#8208;induced pyroptosis lacks specificity, and further exploration of other ions that can induce pyroptosis in cancer cells is needed. Sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) holds promise due to its exceptional penetration depth; however, the rapid recombination of electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs and the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) impede its broader application. Herein, we discovered that antimony (Sb)&#8208;based nanomaterials induced pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, Schottky heterojunctions containing Sb component (Sb2Se3@Pt) were effectively designed and constructed via in situ growth of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) on Sb2Se3 semiconductor with narrow band gaps, which were utilized as US&#8208;heightened pyroptosis initiators to induce highly effective pyroptosis in cancer cells to boost SCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Under US irradiation, excited electrons were transferred from Sb2Se3 nanorods (NRs) to the co&#8208;catalyst Pt via Schottky junctions, and band bending effectively prevented electron backflow and achieved efficient ROS generation. Moreover, the pores oxidized and depleted the overexpressed GSH in the TME, potentially amplifying ROS generation. The biological effects of the Sb2Se3@Pt nanoheterojunction itself combined with the sonocatalytic amplification of oxidative stress significantly induced Caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD&#8208;dependent pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, SCT treatment with Sb2Se3@Pt not only effectively restrained tumor proliferation but also induced potent immune memory responses and suppressed tumor recurrence. Furthermore, the integration of this innovative strategy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment elicited a systemic immune response, effectively augmenting therapeutic effects and impeding the growth of abscopal tumors. Overall, this study provides further opportunities to explore pyroptosis&#8208;mediated SCT&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Patterns in Non&#8208;Reciprocal Active Droplet Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary mixtures of droplets exhibiting non&#8208;reciprocal active interactions self&#8208;organize into dynamic patterns upon tuning the number ratio and size ratio of the two populations and the surfactant composition. A minimal mathematical model recapitulates the experimentally observed patterns. The chemical organizing principles governing the binary droplet system are extendable to multicomponent active droplet mixtures.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self&#8208;organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet mixtures with predator&#8208;prey interactions can result in a variety of self&#8208;organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self&#8208;organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.

         <title>Hemilabile and Redox&#8208;Active Quinone Ligands Unlock sp3&#8208;Rich Couplings in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Carbosulfenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;active quinone ligand enables seamless oxidation state manipulation between Ni(I) and Ni(II) intermediates, which facilitates the migratory insertion step. Meanwhile, the L&#8208;type lone&#8208;pair coordination promotes oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center. These mechanistic discoveries enable the installation of alkylsulfenyl (&#8211;SAlkyl) groups in a series of 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component coupling approach toward structurally complex dialkylsulfides is described via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation of unactivated alkenes with organoboron nucleophiles and alkylsulfenamide (N&#8722;S) electrophiles. Efficient catalytic turnover is facilitated using a tailored N&#8722;S electrophile containing an N&#8208;methyl methanesulfonamide leaving group, allowing catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Regioselectivity is controlled by a collection of monodentate, weakly coordinating native directing groups, including sulfonamides, amides, sulfinamides, phosphoramides, and carbamates. Key to the development of this transformation is the identification of quinones as a family of hemilabile and redox&#8208;active ligands that tune the steric and electronic properties of the metal throughout the catalytic cycle. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that the duroquinone (DQ) ligand adopts different coordination modes in different stages of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation&#8208;binding as an &#951;6 capping ligand to stabilize the precatalyst/resting state and prevent catalyst decomposition, binding as an X&#8208;type redox&#8208;active durosemiquinone radical anion to promote alkene migratory insertion with a less distorted square planar Ni(II) center, and binding as an L&#8208;type ligand to promote N&#8722;S oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center.

Density functional theory (DFT) results show that the duroquinone (DQ) ligand adopts different coordination modes in different stages of the Ni-catalyzed 1,2-carbosulfenylation-binding as an &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; capping ligand to stabilize the precatalyst/resting state and prevent catalyst decomposition, binding as an X-type redox-active durosemiquinone radical anion to promote alkene migratory insertion with a less distorted square planar Ni(II) center, and binding as an L-type ligand to promote N&#8722;S oxidative addition at a relatively more electron-rich Ni(I) center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Confined Ultracapacitive Memristors with Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pronounced physisorption of bioactive cations with a hydrophobic alkyl chain by porous carbons with a negative zeta potential results in confined cations, which triggers anion enrichment and depletion under electric polarization and enables rapid differential ionic memresistance behavior for cations with strong and weak interactions with porous carbons.







Abstract
The field of bioinspired iontronics, bridging electronic devices and ionic systems, has multiple biological applications. Carbon&#8208;based ultracapacitive devices hold promise for controlling bioactive ions via electric double layers due to their high&#8208;surface&#8208;area and biocompatible porous carbon electrodes. However, the interplay between complex bioactive ions and porous carbons remains unclear due to the variety of structures of bioactive ions present in biological systems. Herein, we investigate the adsorption behavior of a series of bioactive ammonium&#8208;based cations with varying alkyl chain lengths in nanoporous carbons. We find that strong physisorption results from the synergistic hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction between porous carbons (with a negative zeta potential) and bioactive cations. Bioactive cations with varying alkyl chain lengths can be irreversibly physically adsorbed and confined within nanoporous carbons resulting in anion enrichment and depletion during electric polarization. This situation, in turn, results in a characteristic memristive behavior in all&#8208;carbon capacitive ionic memristor devices. Our findings highlight the relationship between the resistance state of the memristor and ion adsorption mechanisms in all&#8208;carbon capacitive devices, which hold potential for future transmitter delivery, biointerfacing, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Redox Activity and Potentials of Bidentate N&#8208;Ligands Commonly Applied in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report establishes the redox activity of biOx (bi&#8208;oxazoline), biIm (bi&#8208;imidazoline), and pyIm (pyridine&#8208;imidazoline) ligands in stabilizing nickel radical complexes. Direct comparison of the redox potentials of bidentate N&#8208;ligands provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.







Abstract
Bidentate N&#8208;ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi&#8208;oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species. This finding contrasts with the prior assumption that bi&#8208;oxazoline lacks redox activity due to strong mesomeric donation. Moreover, we conducted systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses of bidentate pyridyl, oxazoline, and imidazoline nitrogen ligands, along with their corresponding nickel complexes. Complexation with nickel shifts the reduction potentials to a more positive region and narrows the differences in redox potentials among the ligands. Additionally, various ligands led to different degrees of bromide dissociation from singly reduced (L)Ni(Ar)(Br) complexes, reflecting varying reactivity in the subsequent activation of alkyl halides, a crucial step in cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. These insights highlight the significant electronic effects of ligands on the stability of metalloradical species and their redox potentials, which interplay with coordination geometry. Quantifying the electron&#8208;donating, &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands, as well as their effect on catalyst speciation, provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.

         <title>An Automated Electrochemical Flow Platform to Accelerate Library Synthesis and Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated electrochemical flow platform for operator&#8208;free data generation is presented, leveraging slug&#8208;based reaction mixtures for low material consumption. This platform was employed in the context of library synthesis of 44 medicinal chemistry&#8208;relevant compounds. The platform was also used to optimize one previously unsuccessful target via DoE, leading to a 6&#8208;fold yield increment.







Abstract
Automated batch and flow setups are well&#8208;established for high throughput experimentation in both thermal chemistry and photochemistry. However, the development of automated electrochemical platforms is hindered by cell miniaturization challenges in batch and difficulties in designing effective single&#8208;pass flow systems. In order to address these issues, we have designed and implemented a new, slug&#8208;based automated electrochemical flow platform. This platform was successfully demonstrated for electrochemical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of E3 ligase binders with diverse amines (44 examples), which were subsequently transferred to a continuous&#8208;flow mode for confirmation and isolation, showing its applicability for medicinal chemistry purposes. To further validate the versatility of the platform, Design of Experiments (DoE) optimization was performed for an unsuccessful library target. This optimization process, fully automated by the platform, resulted in a remarkable 6&#8208;fold increase in reaction yield.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Exceptional Stability and Capacity Retention at High Current Densities</title>

High&#8208;Performance Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Demonstrating exceptional stability and capacity retention at high current densities, COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86 offer promising advancements in electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.







Abstract
Organic polymers are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electrode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, achieving long cycling stability and capacity retention at high current densities remains a significant challenge due to weak structural stability and low conductivity. In this study, we report the synthesis of two novel polyimide covalent organic frameworks (PI&#8208;COFs), COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86, by combining truxenone&#8208;based triamine and linear acid anhydride through polymerization. These PI&#8208;COFs feature layers with pore channels embedded with 18 carbonyl groups, facilitating rapid lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and enhancing structural stability under high current densities. Compared to previously reported organic polymer materials, COF&#8208;JLU86 demonstrates the excellent performance at high current densities, with an impressive specific capacity of 1161.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and outstanding cycling stability, retaining 1289.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles and 401.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 10000 cycles. Additionally, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide mechanistic insights, revealing that the high concentration of carbonyl redox&#8208;active sites and the optimized electronic structure contribute to the excellent electrochemical performance. These results highlight the potential of PI&#8208;COFs as high&#8208;performance organic electrode materials for LIBs, offering a promising solution to the challenges of long&#8208;term stability and capacity retention at high current densities.

         <title>Designing a Refined Multi&#8208;Structural Polymer Electrolyte Framework for Highly Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous and multi&#8208;component ion&#8208;conductive polymer&#8208;based electrolyte was designed based on a refined multi&#8208;structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework. Lithium metal cells with RMSPE have the advantages of high ionic conductivity (0.93&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical window (to 5.1&#8197;V), high Li+ transference number (0.7), long lifetime (&gt;3300 cycles at 1&#8197;C at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability (&gt;200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Rational structural designs of solid polymer electrolytes featuring rich interface&#8208;phase morphologies can improve electrolyte connection and rapid ion transport. However, these rigid interfacial structures commonly result in diminished or entirely inert ionic conductivity within their bulk phase, compromising overall electrolyte performance. Herein, a multi&#8208;component ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte was successfully designed based on a refined multi&#8208;structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework with uniform Li+ solvation chemistry and rapid Li+ transporting kinetics.

&lt;p&gt;A homogeneous and multi-component ion-conductive polymer-based electrolyte was designed based on a refined multi-structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework. Lithium metal cells with RMSPE have the advantages of high ionic conductivity (0.93&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical window (to 5.1&#8197;V), high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.7), long lifetime (&amp;gt;3300 cycles at 1&#8197;C at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent low-temperature adaptability (&amp;gt;200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational structural designs of solid polymer electrolytes featuring rich interface-phase morphologies can improve electrolyte connection and rapid ion transport. However, these rigid interfacial structures commonly result in diminished or entirely inert ionic conductivity within their bulk phase, compromising overall electrolyte performance. Herein, a multi-component ion-conductive electrolyte was successfully designed based on a refined multi-structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework with uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation chemistry and rapid Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporting kinetics. The RMSPE framework is constructed via polymerization-induced phase separation based on a rational combination of lithiophilic components and rigid/flexible chain units with significant hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrasts. Further refined by coating a robust polymer network, this all-organic design endows a homogeneous micro-nano porous structure, providing a novel framework favorable for rapid ion transport in both its soft interfacial and bulk phases. The RMSPE exhibited excellent ion conductivity of 1.91&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature and a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.7. Assembled symmetrical Li cells realized stable cycling for over 2400&#8197;h at 3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full batteries demonstrated a long lifespan of 3300 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;% and stable cycling performance at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C. This innovative design concept offers a promising perspective for achieving high-performance polymer-based Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pairing Chromonic Liquid Crystals via Alternately Stacked Assembly of Amphiphilic Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;pairing assemblies of an amphiphilic porphyrin AuIII complex bearing hydrophilic triethylene glycol groups exhibited the effects of counteranions and solvation at the side chains on the assembly modes. The ion pair with a &#960;&#8208;electronic anion formed charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge&#8208;based thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals and the single&#8208;stranded polymer structure via i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions.







Abstract
In this study, a new assembly strategy for lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) is proposed using i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions, mainly comprising electrostatic and dispersion forces, between charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems to form stacking structures supported by the hydration of triethylene glycol (TEG) units. The meso&#8208;TEG&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted porphyrin AuIII complex, an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;electronic cation, showed diverse states and assembly modes in ion pairs depending on the coexisting counteranions. The PCCp&#8722; ion pair formed a hexagonal columnar (Colh) LC phase based on a charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assembly, suggesting the formation of an ordered arrangement of charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions, with reduced interactions between the TEG chains. Furthermore, in the presence of water, LCLC behavior in the Colh and nematic columnar phases according to the amount of water were observed for the PCCp&#8722; ion pair as a result of i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced orientation of the charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge columnar structures upon dehydration was observed. Furthermore, single&#8208;stranded charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge columnar structures, as components of the LCLCs, were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

         <title>Chemical Recording of Pump&#8208;Specific Drug Efflux in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, the drug of interest competes with the efflux of BEP through specific pumps, resulting in the accumulation of BEP within the cells. The elevated intracellular levels of BEP induced by the drug contribute to a heightened extent of protein labeling. We developed two BEPs based on per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharide labeling and photocatalytic proximity labeling to record drug efflux by multidrug resistance proteins and p&#8208;glycoprotein, respectively.







Abstract
Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac4GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure&#8208;efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high&#8208;throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light&#8208;activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.

         <title>Oriented Titanium&#8208;MOF Membrane for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise orientation control, b&#8208;oriented MIP&#8208;177&#8208;LT membranes exhibit superior performances towards hydrogen purification relying on the 0.3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized window aligned vertical to the substrate. At the same time, due to the synergistic effect of 1&#8197;nm&#8208;sized MOF channel, this spectacular selectivity is combined with a high H2 permeability.







Abstract
Precise hydrogen sorting from purge gas (H2/N2) and coke gas (H2/CH4), commonly carried out by cryogenic distillation, still suffers from low separation efficiency, high energy consumption, and considerable capital cost. Though still in its infancy, membrane technology offers a potential to achieve more efficient hydrogen purification. In this study, an optimum separation of hydrogen towards both methane and nitrogen via a kinetically&#8208;driven mechanism is realized through preferred orientation control of a MOF membrane. Relying on the 0.3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized window aligned vertical to the substrate, b&#8208;oriented Ti&#8208;MOF membrane exhibits ultra&#8208;high hydrogen selectivity, surpassing the upper bound limit of separating H2/N2 and H2/CH4 gas pairs attained so far by inorganic membranes. This spectacular selectivity is combined with a high H2 permeability owing to the synergistic effect of the 1&#8197;nm&#8208;sized MOF channel.

         <title>Interfacial Thermoconvection and Atomic Relay Catalysis Enable Equilibrium Shifting and Rapid Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;Fructose Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by interfacial local thermoconvection is developed to significantly bypass the chemical equilibrium limit for glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization. The synergy of isolated and geminal K single atoms and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect can accelerate photothermal glucose isomerization, affording a high fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% with carbon balance of 95.9&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min at room temperature.







Abstract
The aqueous glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization is controlled by thermodynamics to an equilibrium limit of ~50&#8201;% fructose yield. However, here we report an in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by an interfacial local photothermal effect in combination with relay catalysis of geminal and isolated potassium single atoms (K SAs) on graphene&#8208;type carbon (Ksg/GT) to effectively bypass the equilibrium limit and markedly speed up glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, an unprecedented fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% was obtained over Ksg/GT in an aqueous solution without any additives under 30&#8208;min solar&#8208;like irradiation. Mechanistic studies expounded that the interfacial thermoconvection caused by the local photothermal effect of the graphene&#8208;type carbon and preferable glucose adsorption on single&#8208;atom K could facilitate the release of in situ formed fructose. The geminal K SAs were prone to form a stable metal&#8208;glucose complex via bidentate coordination, and could significantly reduce the C&#8722;H bond electron density by light&#8208;driven electron transfer toward K. This facilitated the hydride shift rate&#8208;determining step and expedited glucose isomerization. In addition, isolated K SAs favored the subsequent protonation and ring&#8208;closure process to furnish fructose.

     alt="Interfacial Thermoconvection and Atomic Relay Catalysis Enable Equilibrium Shifting and Rapid Glucose-to-Fructose Isomerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by interfacial local thermoconvection is developed to significantly bypass the chemical equilibrium limit for glucose-to-fructose isomerization. The synergy of isolated and geminal K single atoms and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect can accelerate photothermal glucose isomerization, affording a high fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% with carbon balance of 95.9&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min at room temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aqueous glucose-to-fructose isomerization is controlled by thermodynamics to an equilibrium limit of ~50&#8201;% fructose yield. However, here we report an in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by an interfacial local photothermal effect in combination with relay catalysis of geminal and isolated potassium single atoms (K SAs) on graphene-type carbon (K&lt;sub&gt;sg&lt;/sub&gt;/GT) to effectively bypass the equilibrium limit and markedly speed up glucose-to-fructose isomerization. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, an unprecedented fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% was obtained over K&lt;sub&gt;sg&lt;/sub&gt;/GT in an aqueous solution without any additives under 30-min solar-like irradiation. Mechanistic studies expounded that the interfacial thermoconvection caused by the local photothermal effect of the graphene-type carbon and preferable glucose adsorption on single-atom K could facilitate the release of in situ formed fructose. The geminal K SAs were prone to form a stable metal-glucose complex via bidentate coordination, and could significantly reduce the C&#8722;H bond electron density by light-driven electron transfer toward K. This facilitated the hydride shift rate-determining step and expedited glucose isomerization. In addition, isolated K SAs favored the subsequent protonation and ring-closure process to furnish fructose. The integration of the interfacial thermoconvection-enhanced in situ removal protocol and tailored atomic catalysis opens a prospective avenue for boosting equilibrium-limited reactions under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multiresponsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Chiral Overcrowded Alkene Twisting Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) based on an enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone. FcD exhibits thermal/photochemical E/Z isomerization and is redox&#8208;switchable, which significantly alters its chiral expression and optical properties. As a chiral dopant in cholesteric liquid crystals, FcD enables redox&#8208;tuning of the liquid crystal reflection color by up to 84&#8197;nm, showcasing its potential in functional materials.







Abstract
The reversible modulation of chirality has gained significant attention not only for fundamental stereochemical studies but also for numerous applications ranging from liquid crystals (LCs) to molecular motors and machines. This requires the construction of switchable molecules with (multiple) chiral elements in a highly enantioselective manner, which is often a significant synthetic challenge. Here, we show that the dimerization of an easily accessible enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone building block affords a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) with pre&#8208;determined double bond geometry, helical chirality, and relative orientation of the two ferrocene motifs in high yield. This intrinsically planar chiral switch can not only undergo thermal or photochemical E/Z isomerization but can also be reversibly and quantitatively oxidized to both a monocationic and a dicationic state which is associated with significant changes in its (chir)optical properties. Specifically, FcD acts as a chiral dopant for cholesteric LCs with a helical twisting power (HTP) of 13&#8197;&#956;m&#8722;1 which, upon oxidation, drops to near zero, resulting in an unprecedently large redox&#8208;tuning of the LC reflection color by up to 84&#8197;nm. Due to the straightforward stereoselective synthesis, FcD, and related chiral switches, are envisioned to be powerful building blocks for multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular machines and in LC&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Rectifying Heterointerface Facilitated C&#8722;N Coupling Dynamics Enables Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis Under Ultralow Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ electroreduction obtained Cu/Cu2O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with rectifying heterointerfaces modulates the adsorption behavior of *CO intermediate to enhance its combination with *NOH for subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics, which achieves a novel and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, resulting in the outstanding Faradaic efficiency and substantial yields across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling for urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional Bosch&#8208;Meiser method. However, the complexity of intermediates in co&#8208;reduction hampers simultaneous improvement in urea yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we developed a Cu/Cu2O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with nanoscale rectifying heterointerfaces through precise controllable in situ electroreduction of Cu2O nanowires, achieving notable FE (32.6&#8211;47.0&#8201;%) and substantial yields (6.08&#8211;30.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials (0 to &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE). Operando synchrotron radiation&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR&#8208;FTIR) confirmed the formation of *CO intermediates and C&#8722;N bonds, subsequently density functional theory (DFT) calculations deciphered that the Cu/Cu2O rectifying heterointerface modulated *CO adsorption, significantly enhancing subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics between *CO and *NOH intermediates. This work not only provides a groundbreaking and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, but also offers deep insights into copper&#8208;based heterointerface catalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Transforming Aryl&#8208;Tetrazines into Bioorthogonal Scissors for Systematic Cleavage of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reactive aryl&#8208;tetrazines are widely used for fast bioorthogonal ligation. However, their application in click&#8208;to&#8208;release chemistry has been impeded by significantly limited release efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduced hydroxyl functionalities to direct and accelerate post&#8208;click tautomerization, resulting in hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines as bioorthogonal tools for highly efficient click&#8208;to&#8208;release of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal bond&#8208;cleavage reactions have emerged as a powerful tool for precise spatiotemporal control of (bio)molecular function in the biological context. Among these chemistries, the tetrazine&#8208;triggered elimination of cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) stands out due to high reaction rates, versatility, and selectivity. Despite an increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, application of this reaction remains limited by the cumulative performance trade&#8208;offs (i.e., click kinetics, release kinetics, release yield) of existing tools. Efficient release has been restricted to tetrazine scaffolds with comparatively low click reactivity, while highly reactive aryl&#8208;tetrazines give only minimal release. By introducing hydroxyl groups onto phenyl&#8208; and pyridyl&#8208;tetrazine scaffolds, we have developed a new class of &#8216;bioorthogonal scissors&#8217; with unique chemical performance. We demonstrate that hydroxyaryl&#8208;tetrazines achieve near&#8208;quantitative release upon accelerated click reaction with cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes, as exemplified by click&#8208;triggered activation of a caged prodrug, intramitochondrial cleavage of a fluorogenic probe (turn&#8208;on) in live cells, and rapid intracellular bioorthogonal disassembly (turn&#8208;off) of a ligand&#8208;dye conjugate.

         <title>Unlocking Oxetane Potential: Modular Synthetic Platform for the Concise Synthesis of Acyclic Oligo&#8208;Isoprenoids and Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxetane&#8208;based platform has been developed for the modular and iterative construction of oxygenated oligo&#8208;isoprenoids with precise geometric control of the olefinic bond(s). In addition, the dual reactivity of alkenyl oxetane fragment has been revealed and exploited to reroute polyene cyclization to the subterminal position.







Abstract
Terpenes occupy a unique place among the secondary metabolites due to their broad utility and extraordinary structural diversity. Their synthesis via polyene cyclization, either biomimetic or enzymatic, represents the cutting edge of modern synthetic chemistry. However, these endeavors have been inherently tied to the availability of natural and non&#8208;natural acyclic polyene starting materials. Herein, we report an oxetane&#8208;based platform for the modular construction of oxygenated polyolefins with precise geometric control. This &#8220;tail&#8208;to head&#8221; iterative method leverages the site&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis of terminal olefins to form an alkylidene oxetane moiety and the regioselective ring opening of alkenyl&#8208;oxetanes for chain elongation. In addition, the unique and peculiar propensity of alkylidene oxetane fragment in various reactions was also revealed and exploited for site&#8208;selective functionalization, cyclization, and as a protecting group in polyenes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Site&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Native Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Davis, Koh, and co&#8208;workers disclosed a method for transforming native sugars through homolytic cleavage of an isolatable S&#8208;glycoside, in notable &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 &#945;&#8201;:&#8201;&#946; stereoselectivity. The sugar is activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (DMC) for the installation of an S&#8208;moiety that undergoes desulfurative C&#8722;C coupling using a combination of Hantzsch ester (HE) as reductant and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) under LED irradiation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates constitute the largest source of biomass on Earth, but their synthetic modification is challenging due to their high content in oxygen functionalities. The site&#8208; and stereoselective modification of native sugars is a definite goal of glycochemistry research. Recent efforts to bypass the need for protecting groups, leveraging selective activation through photochemical mechanisms for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;C bond formation from native sugars, are likely to largely impact all glycochemistry&#8208;related areas. Davis, Koh, and co&#8208;workers have recently presented their use of photocatalysis to develop a &#8220;cap and glycosylate&#8221; approach for the site&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation of native sugars. A modernized direct radical functionalization of in situ formed thioglycoside using photocatalysis was used in the synthetic manipulation of unprotected carbohydrates. This allowed reaching complex saccharides, and post&#8208;translational modification of proteins.

         <title>Engineering Spacer Conjugation for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of highly conjugated spacers has led to the development of efficient and stable 2D/3D PSCs. These organic spacers enhance charge transport and improve resistance to moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% in 24.8&#8208;cm2 modules. Furthermore, the devices maintained over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 3000&#8197;hours of operation under MPP tracking, establishing them as one of the most stable 2D/3D PSCs to date.







Abstract
Incorporating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite in 3D perovskite absorber holds great potential to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the bulky&#8208;cation&#8208;based 2D structures often exhibit poor charge transport and are prone to formation of charge&#8208;extraction barrier that impedes efficient device operation. We address these issues by introducing aromatic spacers with molecular conjugation into 2D perovskites locating between 3D perovskites and electron charge transport layers. Among our tested aromatic spacers, the pyrenylbutanamine (PyBA) spacer was shown to endow 2D perovskites with superior charge transport properties and efficient charge extraction from the bulk perovskite in 2D/3D PSCs, due to the highest degree of conjugation. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.3&#8201;% in a 0.16&#8208;cm2 single cell and 21.0&#8201;% in a 24.8&#8208;cm2 module. Moreover, the incorporated PyBA substantially raised the resistance of 2D/3D PSCs against moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced environmental, thermal, and operational stability. Notably, the PyBA&#8208;based devices retained over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 2000&#8197;hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;% relative humidity, or 1000&#8197;hours at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% humidity, or 3000&#8197;hours of operation under continuous 1&#8208;Sun illumination at 40&#8201;&#176;C, showcasing their exceptionally high stability compared to previously reported 2D/3D PSCs.

         <title>Customizing H2O&#8208;Poor Electric Double Layer and Boosting Texture Exposure of Zn (101) Plane towards Super&#8208;High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All Experimental results and theoretical calculation demonstrate that a H2O&#8208;poor&#160;electrical double layer and preferential exposure of unconventional Zn (101) facet is acquired by adopting a small amount of malate molecules as an electrolyte additive, leading to homogeneous dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and achieving high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
The catastrophic dendrite hyperplasia and parasitic reactions severely impede the future deployment of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Controlling zinc orientation growth is considered to be an effective method to overcome the aforementioned concerns, especially for regulating the (002) plane of deposited Zn. Unfortunately, Zn (002) texture is difficult to obtain stable cycling under high deposition capacity resulting from its large lattice distortion and nonuniform distribution in electric field. Herein, different from traditional cognition, a crystallization orientation regulation tactic is proposed to boost Zn (101) texture exposure and inhibit zinc dendrite proliferation during plating/stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate the malate molecules preferentially adsorb on the Zn (002) facet, leading to the texture exposure of distinctive Zn (101) plane. Meanwhile, the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups of malate molecules exhibit strong adsorption on the Zn anode surface and chelate with Zn2+, achieving H2O&#8208;poor electrical double layer. Very impressively, the multifunctional malate additive enlists zinc anode to survive for 600&#8197;h under a harsh condition of 15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/15&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the symmetric cell harvests highly&#8208;reversible cycling life of 6600&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.25&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkably outperforming the ZnSO4 electrolyte. The assembled Zn//MnO2 full cells also demonstrate prominent electrochemical reversibility.

         <title>L&#8211;Cysteine&#8208;Catalysed Hydration of Activated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine catalyses water addition to activated alkynes, yielding important building blocks in synthetic chemistry such as &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones, &#946;&#8208;ketoamides and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, providing an alternative to metal catalysts. The mild reaction conditions allowed the integration with enzyme catalysis to access a chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy sulfone in high enantiomeric ratio.







Abstract
Hydration reactions consist of the introduction of a molecule of water into a chemical compound and are particularly useful to transform alkynes into carbonyls, which are strategic intermediates in the synthesis of a plethora of compounds. Herein we demonstrate that L&#8211;cysteine can catalyse the hydration of activated alkynes in a very effective and fully regioselective manner to access important building blocks in synthetic chemistry such as &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones, amides and esters, in aqueous media. The mild reaction conditions facilitated the integration with enzyme catalysis to access chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy sulfones from the corresponding alkynes in a one&#8208;pot cascade process in good yields and excellent enantiomeric ratios. These findings pave the way towards establishing a general method for metal&#8208;free, cost&#8208;effective, and more sustainable alkyne hydration processes.

         <title>An Efficient CRISPR/Cas Cooperative Shearing Platform for Clinical Diagnostics Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing system that is capable of the most sensitive unamplified electrochemical assay of nucleic acids up to date. Two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously target different sites of the sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas systems.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas&#8208;CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR&#8208;CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue&#8208;ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5&#8197;minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&#8722;20&#8197;M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays. The CRISPR&#8208;CS platform detects monkeypox, human papilloma virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with an accuracy up to 98.1&#8201;%, demonstrating the potential application of the efficient cooperative shearing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas-CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR-CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas-crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue-ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5&#8197;minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;20&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays. The CRISPR-CS platform detects monkeypox, human papilloma virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with an accuracy up to 98.1&#8201;%, demonstrating the potential application of the efficient cooperative shearing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Dynamic Chirality in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a molecular design where the dynamic chirality of donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores is controlled using a configurationally stable chiral unit. Beyond illustrating the potential of dynamic chirality control to facilitate the access to chiral functional materials, this work highlight the positive influence of chiral perturbation from the configurationally stable chiral unit on the dissymmetry factors of the dynamically chiral fluorophores.







Abstract
Recently, the control of dynamic chirality has emerged as a powerful strategy to design chiral functional materials. In this context, we describe herein a molecular design in which a tethered configurationally stable binaphthyl chiral unit efficiently controls the dynamic chirality of donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores, involving diverse indolocarbazoles as electron donors and terephthalonitrile as an electron acceptor. The high conformational discrimination in such a molecular system suggested by density functional theory calculations is experimentally probed using electronic and vibrational circular dichroism and confirmed by the crystallization of these chiral molecules in gel and their single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work also highlights the positive effect of the configurationally stable chiral unit on the magnitude of the dissymmetry factors of the active dynamically chiral fluorophores, both in ground and excited states, through chiral perturbation.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Restocking Strategy for the Direct Reuse of Degraded LiFePO4 Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for the direct reuse of spent LiFePO4 electrodes is developed by simply soaking the spent electrodes in a lithiation reagent solution at room temperature for 6&#8197;min. Being reused directly, the regenerated LiFePO4 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed in air for 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
The sustainable development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries calls for efficient recycling technologies for spent LFP (SLFP). Even for the advanced direct material regeneration (DMR) method, multiple steps including separation, regeneration, and electrode refabrication processes are still needed. To circumvent these intricacies, new regeneration methods that allow direct electrode reuse (DER) by rejuvenating SLFP electrodes without damaging its structure are desired. Here, a 0.1&#8197;M lithium triethyl borohydride/tetrahydrofuran solution, which has the proper reductive capability to reduce Fe3+ in SLFP to Fe2+ without alloying with the aluminum current collector, is selected as the lithiation/regeneration reagent to restock the Li loss and regenerate SLFP electrodes. By soaking the SLFP electrodes in the lithiation solution, we successfully rejuvenated the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of SLFP electrodes with structural integrity within only 6&#8197;minutes at room temperature. When being directly reused, the regenerated LFP electrodes deliver a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed to air for 3&#8197;months. The DER strategy presents significant economic and environmental benefits compared with the DMR method. This research provides a timely and innovative solution for recycling spent blade batteries using large&#8208;sized LFP electrodes, boosting the closed&#8208;loop development of LFP batteries.

         <title>Dynamic Adaptation of Active Site Driven by Dual&#8208;side Adsorption in Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 reduction reaction mechanisms (CO2RR) on (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts (SACs). The reaction can take on both sides of the metal active centers leading to many different reaction pathways. Each adsorbed intermediate could change the electronic structure of the active site and dynamically assemble into a new catalyst.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom iron embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) is among the most representative single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite the simplicity of the active site, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C remains controversial. Firstly, there is a long debate regarding the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the reactions. Secondly, recent computational and experimental studies are puzzled by the fact that the CO&#8208;poisoned Fe centers still remain highly active at high potentials. Thirdly, there are ongoing challenges in elucidating the high selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over CO2RR at high potentials. In this work, we introduce a novel CO2RR mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, which was inspired by the dynamic of active sites in biological systems. By employing grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory and kinetic Monte&#8208;Carlo, we found that the RDS is not fixed but changes with the applied potential. We demonstrated that our proposed dual&#8208;side mechanisms could clarify the reason behind the high catalytic activity of CO&#8208;poisoned metal centers, as well as the high selectivity of HER over CO2RR at high potential. This study provides a fundamental explanation for long&#8208;standing puzzles of an important catalyst and calls for the importance of considering the dynamic of active sites in reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in Photoelectrochemical Alcohol Oxidation Enhanced by Nickel&#8208;Based Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction was improved by depositing Ni&#8208;based co&#8208;catalyst on the Fe2O3 photoanode. Compared to alcohol, Ni&#8208;based co&#8208;catalyst has a higher bond dissociation free energy, which ensures the transfer of &#945;&#8208;H from the alcohol molecule to the co&#8208;catalyst through proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process.







Abstract
Using biomass oxidation reactions instead of water oxidation reactions is optimal for accomplishing biomass conversion and effective hydrogen generation. Here, we report that &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes with a NiOOH cocatalyst exhibit excellent performance for photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The conversion efficiency for HMF reaches 98.5&#8201;%, while the selectivity for FDCA is 94.2&#8201;%. We revealed that HMF is oxidized through a spontaneous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process with the high&#8208;valent phase of the Ni&#8208;based catalyst. The dangling oxygen and bridging oxygen of the high&#8208;valent phase species serve as proton&#8208;accepting sites. Furthermore, we pointed out that the deprotonated bond dissociation free energy difference between the catalysts and alcohols is the thermodynamic trigger for the PCET process. This study provides a reasonable explanation for the alcohol oxidation reaction, which is beneficial for designing biomass conversion systems.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Stable Single&#8208;Site Pd on CeO2 Catalyst for Selective Amination of Phenols to Aromatic Amines without External Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel/universal aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed for constructing high&#8208;loading single&#8208;site catalysts with excellent thermal durability. Single&#8208;site Pd1/CeO2 catalyst achieved excellent selectivity for important aromatic amines from amination of phenols without external hydrogen, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly gave phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The outstanding properties of the former were attributed to high&#8208;loading Pd1/CeO2 with abundant defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties.







Abstract
Developing a new route to produce aromatic amines as key chemicals from renewable phenols is a benign alternative to current fossil&#8208;based routes like nitroaromatic hydrogenation, but is challenging because of the high dissociation energy of the Ar&#8722;OH bond and difficulty in controlling side reactions. Herein, an aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed to prepare high&#8208;density single&#8208;site cationic Pd species immobilized on CeO2 (Pd1/CeO2) with excellent sintering resistance. The obtained Pd1/CeO2 catalysts achieved remarkable selectivity of important aromatic amines (yield up to 76.2&#8201;%) in the phenols amination with amines without external hydrogen sources, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly afforded phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The excellent catalytic properties of the Pd1/CeO2 are closely related to high&#8208;loading Pd single&#8208;site catalysts with abundant surface defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties. This report provides a sustainable route for producing aromatic amines from renewable feedstocks.

         <title>Establishing the Comprehensive Structure&#8722;Activity Relationship of the Natural Antibiotic Kibdelomycin/Amycolamicin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through extensive chemical synthesis, the first comprehensive structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis of the potent natural antibiotics kibdelomycin (KBD) and amycolamicin (AMM) was established in this study. A key analog with enhanced antibacterial properties was identified, offering valuable insights for the development of novel antibiotics based on KBD/AMM to combat the pressing global challenge of antimicrobial resistance.







Abstract
Kibdelomycin (KBD) and amycolamicin (AMM) are potent natural antibiotics effective against antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including vancomycin&#8208;intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, VISA), methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and quinolone&#8208;resistant S. aureus (QRSA). Their antibacterial activity stems from an unprecedented dual mechanism: the lower binding sites occupy the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of bacterial type II topoisomerases, while the upper binding sites disrupt the enzyme dimer interface. This dual action, combined with their unique chemical structures, positions KBD and AMM as promising scaffolds for developing new antibiotics. However, the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) of KBD/AMM remains underexplored due to their highly complex chemical structures. In this study, we utilized total synthesis to produce KBD/AMM analogs with various site modifications and evaluated their antimicrobial activities. Our findings establish the first comprehensive SAR for KBD/AMM, paving the way for the development of novel KBD/AMM&#8208;based antibiotics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of Staffanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strained bicyclopentane (i.e. [n]staffane) backbones experience the most effective charge transport on a length&#8208;dependent basis than any other &#963;&#8208;bonded organic backbone. STM&#8208;BJ and DFT studies show this enhanced quantum transport originates from the destabilization of the HOMO&#8208;2 which aligns this orbital more closely with the Fermi energy of gold electrodes.







Abstract
We report the first conductance measurements of [n]staffane (bicyclopentane) oligomers in single&#8208;molecule junctions. Our studies reveal two quantum transport characteristics unique to staffanes that emerge from their strained bicyclic structure. First, though staffanes are composed of weakly conjugated C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds, staffanes carry a shallower conductance decay value (&#946;=0.84&#177;0.02&#8197;n&#8722;1) than alkane chain analogs (&#946;=0.96&#177;0.03&#8197;n&#8722;1) when measured with the scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Staffanes are thus more conductive than other &#963;&#8208;bonded organic backbones reported in the literature on a per atom basis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest staffane backbones are more effective conduits for charge transport because their significant bicyclic ring strain destabilizes the HOMO&#8208;2 energy, aligning it more closely with the Fermi energy of gold electrodes as oligomer order increases. Second, the monostaffane is significantly lower conducting than expected. DFT calculations suggest that short monostaffanes sterically enforce insulating gauche interelectrode orientations over syn orientations; these steric effects are alleviated in longer staffanes. Moreover, we find that [2&#8208;5]staffane wires may accommodate axial mechanical strain by &#8220;rod&#8208;bending&#8221;. These findings show for the first time how bicyclic ring strain can enhance charge transmission in saturated molecular wires. These studies showcase the STM&#8208;BJ technique as a valuable tool for uncovering the stereoelectronic proclivities of molecules at material interfaces.

         <title>Fully Exposed Ru Clusters for the Efficient Multi&#8208;Step Toluene Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully exposed and atomically dispersed Ru clusters composed by an average of 3 Ru atoms were successfully fabricated and exhibited robust catalytic performance in the multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of toluene to methylcyclohexane, compared with Ru single atoms, Ru nanoparticles and even previously reported catalysts. The theoretical calculations revealed that the synergetic interaction among neighboring Ru atoms in the fully exposed cluster guarantees effective activation of the reactant and easy desorption of the product.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are attractive platform molecules that play an important role in hydrogen energy storage and utilization. The multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of toluene (TOL) to methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been widely studied in the LOCHs systems, due to their relatively low toxicity and reasonable hydrogen storage capacity. Noble metal catalysts such as Ru has exhibited good performance in multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reactions, while the application is still hindered by their high cost and low specific activity. Therefore, the primary challenge lies in the development of noble metal catalysts with both robust activity and efficient atomic utilization. In this study, a series of Ru species ranging from single atoms, fully exposed clusters to nanoparticles were fabricated to investigate their structural evolution in the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction. The fully exposed and atomically dispersed Ru clusters, composed of an average of 3 Ru atoms, exhibit superior catalytic performance and recycle ability in TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation. Moreover, it delivers a high turnover frequency of 9850.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 under the relatively mild reaction (100&#8201;&#176;C, 1.5&#8197;MPa), compared with those of single atoms and nanoparticles, and shows a notable advantage over catalysts reported in previous studies. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the overall barrier of the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction over the fully exposed Ru clusters is significantly lower than that of single atoms and nanoparticles, resulting in its higher activity. The present work provides an efficient strategy to regulate the reaction pathway of multi&#8208;step complicated catalytic reactions by designing fully exposed metal cluster catalysts.

         <title>Rational Design of Crystalline and Enantiomerically Pure Helicenes with Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized enantiopure o&#8208;quinone functionalized helicene diradicals including dianions and neutral boron&#8208;containing species. Their singlet ground state were confirmed by experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Notably, heteroatom boron&#8208;incorporated helicene not only shows stronger chiroptical responses in near NIR region compared to dianion salts but also displays better thermal stability.







Abstract
Helicene diradical derivatives have attracted widespread attentions because of their unique magnetic and chiroptoelectronic properties, however, crystalline and enantiomerically pure forms of helicene diradicals are extremely rare. Herein, we describe the rational design and synthesis of o&#8208;quinone functionalized helicene diradicals with crystalline enantiomerical purity. Diradical dianion salt Rac&#8208;3K and its enantiomers P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by reduction of corresponding precursors Rac&#8208;3 and P/M&#8208;3 with two equivalent potassium graphite in THF in the presence of (di)benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6. Neutral dioxoborocyclic helicene diradicals (Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3B) were produced by reactions of Rac&#8208;3 or P/M&#8208;3 with chlorobis(perfluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)2Cl. Crystal structures of compounds Rac&#8208;3K, Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Their open&#8208;shell singlet state ground states were confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and theoretical calculations. Their chiroptical properties were investigated by the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. This work provides the first examples of enantiopure helicene diradical dianions and boron&#8208;containing helicene diradicals.

         <title>Molecular Photoswitching Unlocks Glucose Oxidase for Synergistically Reinforcing Fenton Reactions for Antitumor Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe(III)&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based nanoparticles capable of generating strong oxidative stress for eradicating tumors with spatial precision is developed based on the phototriggered cascade enzymatic reaction&#8208;Fenton reaction. The photoswitching of spiropyran (SP) unlocks the enzymatic activity of glucose oxidase (GOx) and light triggers Fe(III)&#8208;to&#8208;Fe(II) photoreduction, which jointly reinforce Fenton reactions by providing the triple enabling factors therein.







Abstract
We have developed a new type of nanoparticles with potent antitumor activity photoactivatable via the combination of molecular photoswitching of spiropyran (SP) and enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase (GOx). As two key processes involved therein, Fe(III)&#8208;to&#8208;Fe(II) photoreduction in Fe(III) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) brings about the release of free Fe2+/Fe3+ while the photoswitching of SP to merocyanine (MC) unlocks the enzymatic activity of GOx that was pre&#8208;passivated by SP. The release of free Fe3+ boosts its hydrolysis and therefore enables the acidification of microenvironment, which is further reinforced by one of the products of the GOx&#8208;mediated glucose oxidation reaction, gluconic acid (GlcA). Based on the generation of Fe2+ and acidic milieu together with another product of the oxidation reaction, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), these two processes jointly present triple enabling factors for generating lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) species via Fenton reactions and therefore oxidative stress capable of inhibiting tumor. The antitumor potency of such nanoparticle is verified in tumor&#8208;bearing model mice in vivo, proclaiming its potential as a potent and safe agent based on the unique mechanism of optically manipulating enzyme activity for synergistic antitumor therapeutics with high spatial precision, enhanced efficacy and minimized side effects.

         <title>Promotion of RNF168&#8208;Mediated Nucleosomal H2A Ubiquitylation by Structurally Defined K63&#8208;Polyubiquitylated Linker Histone H1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy termed CAEPL (Cysteine Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation) was developed to prepare K63&#8208;polyubiquitylated linker histone H1, which was used to investigate the PTM crosstalk between H1 ubiquitylation and H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168. It was revealed that K63&#8208;polyubiquitylated H1 can directly promote RNF168 ubiquitylation activity towards H2A by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and the chromatosome.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of histones with homogeneous modifications is a powerful approach for quantitatively deciphering the functional crosstalk between different post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). In this study, we developed an expedient site&#8208;specific (poly)ubiquitylation strategy (CAEPL, Cysteine Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation), which integrates the Cys&#8208;aminoethylation reaction with the process of ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzyme UBA1&#8208;assisted native chemical ligation. Using this strategy, we successfully prepared monoubiquitylated and K63&#8208;linked di&#8208; and tri&#8208;ubiquitylated linker histone H1.0 proteins, which were incorporated into individual chromatosomes. Quantitative biochemical analysis of different RNF168 constructs on H1 ubiquitylated chromatosomes with different ubiquitin chain lengths demonstrated that K63&#8208;linked polyubiquitylated H1.0 could directly stimulate RNF168 ubiquitylation activity by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and the chromatosome. Subsequent cryo&#8208;EM structural analysis of the RNF168/UbcH5c&#8211;Ub/H1.0&#8208;K63&#8208;Ub3 chromatosome complex revealed the potential recruitment orientation between RNF168 UDM1 domain and K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chain on H1.0. Finally, we explored the impact of H1.0 ubiquitylation on RNF168 activity in the context of asymmetric H1.0&#8211;K63&#8208;Ub3 di&#8208;nucleosome substrate, revealing a comparable stimulation effect of both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;nucleosomal crosstalk. Overall, our study highlights the significance of access to structurally defined polyubiquitylated H1.0 by the CAEPL strategy, enabling in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations of in&#8208;trans PTM crosstalk between linker histone H1.0 and core histone H2A ubiquitylation.

         <title>Dual Metallosalen&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we constructed a series of dual metal sites dispersed Salen&#8208;based COFs (MM&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs, M: Zn, Ni, Cu) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction. The ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF displays a remarkable CO2 conversion activity of 102.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under a diluted CO2 atmosphere from simulated flue gas (15&#8201;% CO2), which is a record high activity among COF&#8208; and MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts under the same condition.







Abstract
Directly converting CO2 in flue gas using artificial photosynthetic technology represents a promising green approach for CO2 resource utilization. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve efficient reduction of CO2 from flue gas due to the decreased activity of photocatalysts in diluted CO2 atmosphere. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of dual metallosalen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MM&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs, M: Zn, Ni, Cu) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction and confirmed their advantage in comparison to that of single metal M&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs. As a results, the ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF with dual Zn sites exhibits a prominent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 150.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under pure CO2 atmosphere, which is ~6&#8197;times higher than that of single metal Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF. Notably, the dual metal ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF still displays efficient CO2 conversion activity of 102.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 atmosphere from simulated flue gas conditions (15&#8201;% CO2), which is a record high activity among COFs&#8208; and MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts under the same reaction conditions. Further investigations and theoretical calculations suggest that the synergistic effect between the neighboring dual metal sites in the ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF facilitates low concentration CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Self&#8208;Resistance Gene&#8208;Guided Discovery of the Molecular Basis for Biosynthesis of the Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitor Cerulenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cerulenin is the first reported fatty acid synthase inhibitor, yet its biosynthesis has remained elusive for six decades. The biosynthetic gene cluster of cerulenin has now been uncovered from the genomes of two Sarocladium fungal species using a self&#8208;resistance gene mining strategy. The gene cluster was validated by heterologous expression in A.&#8197;nidulans and cerulenin biosynthesis was elucidated using molecular biology approaches.







Abstract
Cerulenin (1) is the first reported natural fatty acid synthase inhibitor and has been intensively researched for its antifungal, anticancer and anti&#8208;obesity properties. However, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis has remained a mystery for six decades. Here, we have identified the polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster (cer) responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 from two Sarocladium species using a self&#8208;resistance gene mining approach, which we validated via heterologous reconstitution of cer cluster in an Aspergillus nidulans host. Expression of various combinations of cer genes uncovered key pathway intermediates, electrocyclisation products derived from PKS&#8208;encoded polyenoic acids, and a suite of 13 new analogues of 1. This enabled us to establish a biosynthetic pathway to 1 that starts with a C12 polyketide precursor containing both E and Z double bonds and involves a complex series of epoxidations, double bond shifts, E/Z isomerisation and epoxide reduction. Using in vitro assays, we further validated the roles of amidotransferase CerD in amidation, and oxidase CerF and reductase CerE in the final two&#8208;electron oxidation and enone reduction steps towards 1. These findings expand our understanding of complex tailoring modifications in highly reducing PKS pathways and pave the way for the engineered biosynthesis of cerulenin analogues.

     alt="Self-Resistance Gene-Guided Discovery of the Molecular Basis for Biosynthesis of the Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitor Cerulenin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerulenin is the first reported fatty acid synthase inhibitor, yet its biosynthesis has remained elusive for six decades. The biosynthetic gene cluster of cerulenin has now been uncovered from the genomes of two &lt;i&gt;Sarocladium&lt;/i&gt; fungal species using a self-resistance gene mining strategy. The gene cluster was validated by heterologous expression in &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;nidulans&lt;/i&gt; and cerulenin biosynthesis was elucidated using molecular biology approaches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerulenin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is the first reported natural fatty acid synthase inhibitor and has been intensively researched for its antifungal, anticancer and anti-obesity properties. However, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis has remained a mystery for six decades. Here, we have identified the polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster (&lt;i&gt;cer&lt;/i&gt;) responsible for the biosynthesis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; from two &lt;i&gt;Sarocladium&lt;/i&gt; species using a self-resistance gene mining approach, which we validated via heterologous reconstitution of &lt;i&gt;cer&lt;/i&gt; cluster in an &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus nidulans&lt;/i&gt; host. Expression of various combinations of &lt;i&gt;cer&lt;/i&gt; genes uncovered key pathway intermediates, electrocyclisation products derived from PKS-encoded polyenoic acids, and a suite of 13 new analogues of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. This enabled us to establish a biosynthetic pathway to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; that starts with a C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; polyketide precursor containing both &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; double bonds and involves a complex series of epoxidations, double bond shifts, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerisation and epoxide reduction. Using in vitro assays, we further validated the roles of amidotransferase CerD in amidation, and oxidase CerF and reductase CerE in the final two-electron oxidation and enone reduction steps towards &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrophosphorylation of Unactivated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphorylation of alkynes is reported, marking the inaugural example of dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydrophosphorylation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The reaction exhibits a broad scope of unactivated alkynes, consistently yielding structurally diverse P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds with exclusive cis&#8208;selectivity and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;r.r. and 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds are essential across various fields, yet their synthesis via enantioselective P&#8722;C bond formation remains both challenging and underdeveloped. We report the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphorylation of alkynes, facilitated by a newly designed chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. Unlike previous methods that rely on kinetic resolution with less than 50&#8201;% conversion, our approach employs a distinct dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation mechanism, achieving complete conversion of racemic starting materials. This reaction is compatible with a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes, producing products with high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), exclusive cis selectivity, and exceptional regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;r.r. and up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The resulting products were further transformed into a diverse array of enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction details.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Anionic Coordination Manipulation Induces Phosphorus and Boron&#8208;Rich Gradient Interphase Towards Stable and Safe Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte that constructs a gradient CEI dominated by inorganic compounds. This interphase is thin, dense, and enriched with phosphides and borides, which effectively inhibits side&#8208;reactions and facilitates rapid Na+ transport, thus enabling safe and stable cycling of SMBs.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage sodium metal batteries (SMBs) present a viable pathway towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;based batteries due to the competitive cost advantage and abundant supply of sodium resources. However, they still suffer from severe capacity decay induced by the notorious decomposition of the electrolyte under high voltage and unstable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). In addition, the high reactivity of Na metal and flammable electrolytes push SMBs to their safety limits. Herein, a special dual&#8208;anion aggregated Na+ solvation structure is designed in a nonflammable trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, and a gradient CEI enriched with phosphorus and boron compounds is formed on the cathode. This thin and stable interphase effectively suppresses the parasitic reaction, improves the interfacial stability of the cathode, and facilitates Na+ transport through the interface by the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;components, thus optimizing the cycling stability and safety of SMBs. The Na0.95Ni0.4Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2//Na batteries employing such electrolyte provide a discharge capacity of 167.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high retention in the capacity of 85.2&#8201;% after 800&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This approach offers a general strategy for the design of flame&#8208;retardant high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and the practical application of SMBs.

         <title>Pyrrolic&#8208;Nitrogen Chemistry in 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)imidazole Electrolyte Additives toward a 50,000&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, pyrrolic&#8208;N functional groups within the HEI electrolyte additives are shown to effectively control reversible Zn deposition and prevent the polyiodide shuttle at the I2 cathode, attributed to ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The pyrrolic&#8208;N sites exhibit a greater adsorption capacity for polyiodides compared to graphitic&#8208;N and O sites, thereby imparting an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 50,000 cycles to the aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 battery.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries offer benefits such as low cost and high safety. Nevertheless, their commercial application is hindered by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polyiodide shuttle, which result in a short lifespan. In this study, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)imidazole (HEI) organic molecules featuring pyrrole&#8208;N groups are introduced as dually&#8208;functional electrolyte additives to simultaneously stabilize Zn anode and confine polyiodide through ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The pyrrole&#8208;N groups in HEI can preserve the interfacial pH equilibrium at Zn anode by reversibly capturing H+ ions and dynamically neutralizing OH&#8722; ions, thereby suppressing the HER. Notably, the H2 evolution rate at the Zn anode is reduced to a mere 2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;h&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the pyrrole&#8208;N moieties in HEI effectively curtail the polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode, which show adsorption energies of &#8722;0.174&#8197;eV for I2, &#8722;0.521&#8197;eV for I3&#8722;, and &#8722;0.768&#8197;eV for I&#8722;, as indicated by density functional theory calculations. Electrochemical testing demonstrates that the Zn//Zn symmetric cell maintains stable cycling for up to 4,200&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Most strikingly, at a high I2 mass loading of 9.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery achieves an extraordinary cycle life of 50,000 cycles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment and tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment effect is designed for efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia in wide NO3&#8722; concentrations ranging from 15 to 1800&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1, delivering an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.33&#8197;V vs. RHE and a high FE of 98.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NRA) offers a sustainable approach for NH3 production and NO3&#8722; removal but suffers from low NH3 yield rate (&lt;1.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We present bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment, which achieve an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.33&#8197;V vs. RHE, a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term operation stability at 1800&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;, outperforming most of the recently reported catalysts. At a NO3&#8722; concentration as low as 15&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1, it still delivers a high FE of 86.9&#8201;% and an NH3 selectivity of 93.8&#8201;%. Finite&#8208;element method and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu11Ag3 exhibits reduced adsorption energy barrier of *N intermediates, favorable water dissociation for *H generation and high energy barrier for H2 formation, while its tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment promoting NO3&#8722; accumulation.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Polymer Gel Electrolyte towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Fiber Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one polydopamine chemistry&#8208;regulated gel electrolyte is designed to enhance both the anode reversibility and cathode kinetics of fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries, offering a novel strategy for developing flexible metal&#8208;air batteries with extended lifespan and high energy efficiency.







Abstract
Fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries are explored as promising power systems for wearable and portable electronic devices due to their intrinsic safety and the use of ambient oxygen as cathode material. However, challenges such as limited zinc anode reversibility and sluggish cathode reaction kinetics result in poor cycling stability and low energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we design a polydopamine&#8208;based all&#8208;in&#8208;one gel electrolyte (PAGE) that simultaneously regulates the reversibility of zinc anodes and the kinetics of air cathodes through polydopamine interfacial and redox chemistry, respectively. The intrinsic catechol and carboxylate groups in PAGE regulate the transport and solvation structure of Zn2+, facilitating dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition with a lamellar stacking morphology. Additionally, the oxidation of redox&#8208;active catechol groups in PAGE replaces the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction on the air cathode and reduces the energy barrier for charging, enabling fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries to achieve a significantly improved energy efficiency of 95&#8201;% and a longer lifespan of 40&#8197;hours. Further integration into self&#8208;powered electronic textiles underscores its potential for next&#8208;generation wearable systems.

         <title>Selective Methylation of Cyclic Ether Towards Highly Elastic Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Silicon&#8208;based Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective methylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) shifts ring&#8208;opening polymerization from bulk to interface, creating an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for silicon anodes. 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (4MDOL), with higher ring strain and hyperconjugation, forms high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers in the SEI. This flexible, elastic interface accommodates silicon&#8216;s volume changes, enhancing electrochemical stability and long&#8208;term performance.







Abstract
Silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes offer high theoretical capacity for lithium&#8208;ion batteries but suffer from severe volume changes and continuous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation. Here, we address these challenges by selective methylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), thus shifting the unstable bulk polymerization to controlled interfacial reactions and resulting in a highly elastic SEI. Comparative studies of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (2MDOL) and 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (4MDOL) reveal that 4MDOL, with its larger ring strain and more stable radical intermediates due to hyperconjugation effect, promotes the formation of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymeric species at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This elastic, polymer&#8208;rich SEI effectively accommodates volume changes of Si and inhibits continuous side reactions. Our designed electrolyte enables Si&#8208;based anode to achieve 85.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C without additives, significantly outperforming conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes. Full cells also demonstrate stable long&#8208;term cycling. This work provides new insights into molecular&#8208;level electrolyte design for high&#8208;performance Si anodes, offering a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced energy density and longevity.

         <title>Amorphous Nanobelts for Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the hard&#8208;soft acids&#8208;bases theory, here we develop a general strategy for preparing 1D amorphous nanomaterials through the modulation of bond strength between metal ions and organic ligands for a moderated fastness. Even crystalline nanomaterials could also be amorphized by reducing the hardness of ions through redox reaction and weak the bond, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical nitrate reduction.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) amorphous nanomaterials combine the advantages of high active site concentration of amorphous structure, high specific surface area and efficient charge transfer of 1D materials, so they present promising opportunities for catalysis. However, how to achievie the balance between the high orientation of 1D morphology and the isotropy of amorphous structure is a significant challenge, which severely obstructs the controllable preparation of 1D amorphous materials. Guided by the hard&#8208;soft acids&#8208;bases theory, here we develop a general strategy for preparing 1D amorphous nanomaterials through the precise modulation of bond strength between metal ions and organic ligands for a moderated fastness. The soft base dodecanethiol (DT) is multifunctionally served as both structure&#8208;regulating agent and morphology&#8208;directing agent. Compared with the borderline acids (e.g. Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+) to construct amorphous structure, soft acid of Cu+ which produced crystalline nanobelts can still be amorphized by reducing the hardness of Cu ions through redox reaction to weak Cu&#8722;SR bond. Due to the combined advantages of amorphous structure and one&#8208;dimensional morphology, amorphous CuDT nanobelts exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical nitrate reduction, outperformed most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This work will effectively bridge the gap between traditional 1D crystalline nanomaterials synthesis and their amorphization preparation.

         <title>Engineering of a Multi&#8208;Modular DNA Nanodevice for Spatioselective Imaging and Evaluation of NK Cell&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a multi&#8208;modular, structurally&#8208;ordered DNA nanodevice for evaluating NK cell&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy (MODERN) that enabled the spatioselective imaging of GzmA in cancer cells through an innovative path of GzmA&#8208;induced APE1 inactivation. The MODERN demonstrated excellent selectivity, sensitivity, and long&#8208;term integrity in cancer cells, providing a reliable tool for evaluating NK&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy efficacy.







Abstract
Granzyme&#8197;A (GzmA) secreted by natural killer (NK) cells has garnered considerable interest as a biomarker to evaluate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. However, current methodologies to selectively monitor the spatial distribution of GzmA in cancer cells during NK cell&#8208;targeted therapy are extremely challenging, primarily due to the existence of diverse cell populations, the low levels of GzmA expression, and the limited availability of GzmA probes. Herein we develop a multi&#8208;modular, structurally&#8208;ordered DNA nanodevice for evaluating NK cell&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy (MODERN), that permits spatioselective imaging of GzmA in cancer cells through GzmA&#8208;induced apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8197;1 (APE1) inactivation. The MODERN incorporates multiple functional modules, including an APE1&#8208;gated recognition module, a photo&#8208;activated amplification module, an aptamer&#8208;mediated tumor&#8208;target module, and a polycatenane DNA module, enabling improved sensitivity and specificity towards intracellular GzmA. The MODERN was activated (on) in cancer cells due to the overexpression of APE1, whereas it remained silent (off) in the NK&#8208;treated cancer cells owing to the GzmA&#8208;induced APE1 inactivation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GzmA&#8208;induced APE1 inactivation blocks the cellular repair of target cells, resulting in efficient cell death. This MODERN that relies on the specific inactivation of APE1 by GzmA should be beneficial for evaluating the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a multi-modular, structurally-ordered DNA nanodevice for evaluating NK cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy (&lt;b&gt;MODERN&lt;/b&gt;) that enabled the spatioselective imaging of GzmA in cancer cells through an innovative path of GzmA-induced APE1 inactivation. The MODERN demonstrated excellent selectivity, sensitivity, and long-term integrity in cancer cells, providing a reliable tool for evaluating NK-mediated cancer immunotherapy efficacy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granzyme&#8197;A (GzmA) secreted by natural killer (NK) cells has garnered considerable interest as a biomarker to evaluate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. However, current methodologies to selectively monitor the spatial distribution of GzmA in cancer cells during NK cell-targeted therapy are extremely challenging, primarily due to the existence of diverse cell populations, the low levels of GzmA expression, and the limited availability of GzmA probes. Herein we develop a &lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;ulti-modular, structurally-&lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;rdered &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;NA nanodevice for &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;valuating NK cell-mediated cance&lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt; immu&lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt;otherapy (MODERN), that permits spatioselective imaging of GzmA in cancer cells through GzmA-induced apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8197;1 (APE1) inactivation. The MODERN incorporates multiple functional modules, including an APE1-gated recognition module, a photo-activated amplification module, an aptamer-mediated tumor-target module, and a polycatenane DNA module, enabling improved sensitivity and specificity towards intracellular GzmA. The MODERN was activated (on) in cancer cells due to the overexpression of APE1, whereas it remained silent (off) in the NK-treated cancer cells owing to the GzmA-induced APE1 inactivation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GzmA-induced APE1 inactivation blocks the cellular repair of target cells, resulting in efficient cell death. This MODERN that relies on the specific inactivation of APE1 by GzmA should be beneficial for evaluating the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Reconstruction of Self&#8208;Assembling Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust metal&#8208;phenolic coating on the surface of self&#8208;assembled nanospheres has been shown to induce supramolecular reconstruction, enhancing the stability and photogenerated electron transfer during photocatalytic reactions. This synergistic hybrid system significantly boosts both hydrogen production and the sustainability of continuous reactions.







Abstract
Natural photosynthetic systems require spatiotemporal organization to optimize photosensitized reactions and maintain overall efficiency, involving the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of photosynthetic components and their stabilization through synergistic interactions. However, replicating this level of organization is challenging due to the difficulty in efficiently communicating supramolecular nano&#8208;assemblies with nanoparticles or biological architectures, owing to their dynamic instability. Herein, we demonstrate that the supramolecular reconstruction of self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic rhodamine B nanospheres (RN) through treatment with metal&#8208;phenolic coordination complexes results in the formation of a stable hybrid structure. This reconstructed structure enhances electron transfer efficiency, leading to improved photocatalytic performance. Due to the photoluminescence quenching property of RN and its electronic synergy with tannic acid (T) and zirconium (Z), the supramolecular complexes of hybrid nanospheres (RNTxZy) with Pt nanoparticles or a biological workhorse, Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, showed marked improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production. The supramolecular hybrid particles with a metal&#8208;phenolic coordination layer showed 5.6&#8208; and 4.0&#8208;fold increases, respectively, in the productivities of hydrogen evolution catalyzed by Pt (Pt/RNTxZy) and MR&#8208;1 (M/RNTxZy), respectively. These results highlight the potential for further advancements in the structural and photochemical control of supramolecular nanomaterials for energy harvesting and bio&#8208;hybrid systems.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Boron Amino Acid for Positron Emission Tomography and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BBPA is a boramino acid derived from the rational design of BPA, serving as a theranostic agent for both PET imaging and BNCT. It shares the same chemical structure, differing only in isotopic composition, which allows [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET to be seamlessly integrated with BBPA&#8208;BNCT, offering a boron delivery capacity that surpasses that of BPA.







Abstract
Trifluoroborate boronophenylalanine (BBPA) is a boron amino acid analog of 4&#8208;boronophenylalanine (BPA) but with a trifluoroborate group (&#8722;BF3&#8722;) instead of a carboxyl group (&#8722;COOH). Clinical studies have shown that 18F&#8722;labeled BBPA ([18F]BBPA) can produce high&#8208;contrast tumor images in positron emission tomography (PET). Beyond PET imaging, BBPA is a theranostic agent for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Because BBPA possesses an identical chemical structure to BNCT and PET, it can potentially predict the boron concentration for BNCT using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. The synthesis of BBPA was achieved by selectively fluorinating the &#945;&#8208;aminoborate compound, taking advantage of the varying rates of solvolysis of the B&#8722;F bond. The study showcased the high&#8208;contrast [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET imaging in various tumor models, highlighting its broad applicability for both [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET and BBPA&#8208;BNCT. [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET tumor uptake remains consistent across various doses, including those used in BNCT. This enables accurate estimation of the boron concentration in tumors using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. With its dual boron structure, BBPA increases boron concentration in tumor cells and tumor tissues compared to BPA. Thus, less boron carrier is needed. This study introduces a new theranostic boron carrier that enhances boron accumulation in tumors, predicts boron concentration, and enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of BNCT.

         <title>Dynamic Organic Phosphorescence Glass by Rigid&#8208;Soft Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;soft coupling strategy is adopted to prepare organic phosphorescence glass with excellent shaping ability. The glasses exhibit stable RTP and fascinating HTP emission in harsh conditions, and the phosphorescence behavior can be dynamically manipulated by photoactivation. Direct patterning is further achieved using photolithography to offer various afterglow patterns, which can be easily erased and rewritten with good reversibility.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescence glass has garnered considerable attention owing to the excellent shaping ability and photophysical behavior, but facile construction from single&#8208;component phosphors is still challenging. Herein, a rigid&#8208;soft coupling design is adopted in organic phosphors of ICO, CCO and PCO, thus preparing phosphorescence glasses through melting&#8208;quenching method to give excellent shaping ability and dynamic phosphorescence. RTP performance is significantly enhanced in the dense&#8208;structure glass, and intriguing high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) is still observable even at 400&#8197;K. Direct patterning under UV irradiation is also achieved using photolithography technique, allowing for the creation of high&#8208;quality afterglow patterns that can be reversibly erased and rewritten. This rigid&#8208;soft conformation in organic phosphors elucidates a promising concept for achieving efficient RTP glass with wide application prospects.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emitting Helically Twisted Conjugated Frameworks Consisting of Alternant Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Units and Multiple Boron Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and a helically twisted conjugated framework has led to a family of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems showing red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, with the cis/trans configurational isomers exhibiting similar photophysical properties. The observed narrow, red&#8208;shifted emission could be explained by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A novel design strategy to construct bright and narrow near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission materials with suppressed shoulder peaks can significantly enhance their performance in various applications. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a series of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems bridged by boron atoms, achieving bright red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions with notably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 35&#8197;nm (0.08&#8197;eV) and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) up to 80&#8201;%. These compounds display red&#8208;shifted emissions up to 753&#8197;nm in higher concentrations. Cis/trans configurational isomers of multi&#8208;boron&#8208;bridged molecule BN3 exhibit similar photophysical properties. The unique combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and the helically twisted conjugated framework is pivotal in achieving the red&#8208;shifted, narrowband emission. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of BN2 and BN3&#8208;a reveals that the extension of boron&#8208;bridged D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A skeletons significantly increases the distortion of the skeleton. Systematic theoretical calculations show how the boron CE&#8208;CT mechanism, in conjunction with the helical twist, leads to the narrowing of emission bands while simultaneously red&#8208;shifting them into the NIR region. This work could open new avenues for the development of advanced materials with tailored optical properties, particularly in the challenging and highly sought&#8208;after NIR spectrum.

         <title>A Urease&#8208;Based pH Photoswitch: A General Route to Light&#8208;to&#8208;pH Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general module for light&#8208;to&#8208;pH transduction in enzymatic reaction networks is presented. Using an azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitor for urease, it becomes possible to time&#8208;program a pH transition from 4.7 to 8.3 by light. The autocatalytic positive feedback loop resulting from the pH dependence of urease activity enhances the effective switching factor of the inhibitor. The pH change leads to a change in the activity of other enzymes downstream. These findings show a new and general route to functional light&#8208;responsive ERNs.







Abstract
New approaches for the integration of chemical and physical stimuli to control the dynamics of artificial enzymatic reaction networks (ERNs) are needed. Here, we present a general approach to convert a light stimulus into a time&#8208;programmed pH response. We developed and characterized a panel of photoswitchable inhibitors of urease. Urease activity, now regulated by light via the photoinhibitors, leads to an increase in pH upon hydrolysis of urea into ammonia. Careful choice of characteristics of light, and concentrations of enzyme, substrate, and photoinhibitor, allowed us to control the timing of the pH transition. Furthermore, as all enzymes have an activity&#8211;pH profile, the urease photoinhibitor system can be used to regulate the activities of other enzymes in small reaction networks.

         <title>Luminescence Modulation in Boron&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Based Luminogens via Boron Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils, for the first time, how the boron isotope effects shape the photophysical properties of boron cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In comparison to 10B, 11B enables to enhance luminous efficiency (the heavier, the brighter), reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (the heavier, the narrower), and extend luminescence lifetime (the heavier, the longer).







Abstract
Recent advances in luminescent materials highlight the significant impact of hydrogen isotope effects on improving optoelectronic properties. However, the research on the influence of the boron isotope effects on photophysical properties remains underdeveloped. This study focused on exploring the boron isotope effects in boron&#8208;cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In doing so, we designed and synthesized carborane&#8208;based luminogens containing 98&#8201;% 10B and 95&#8201;% 11B, respectively, and observed distinct photophysical behaviors. Compared to the 10B&#8208;enriched luminogens, the 11B&#8208;enriched counterparts can significantly enhance luminescence efficiency, prolong emission lifetime, and reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum. Additionally, increased thermal stability, redshifted B&#8722;H vibrations, and a fourfold enhanced electrochemiluminescence intensity have also been observed. On the other hand, the biological assessments of a 10B&#8208;enriched luminogen reveals low cytotoxicity, high boron uptake, and excellent fluorescence imaging capability, indicating the potential application in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This work presents the first comprehensive exploration on the boron isotope effects in boron clusters, and provides valuable insights into the rational design of organic luminogens for advanced optoelectronic and biomedical applications.

         <title>Does H2 Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reduction Always Probe Solid&#8208;State Redox Chemistry? The Case of Pt/CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox reactions on transition metal oxides are crucial in heterogeneous catalysis. H2 temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (H2&#8208;TPR) is often used to measure oxide reducibility by monitoring H2 consumption. However, oxide reduction involves steps like H2 dissociation and H&#8208;diffusion before H2O formation. Our study on CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 found that TPR kinetics relate to H&#8208;spillover at Pt&#8208;CeO2 interface and Pt nanocluster abundance, not CeO2 reducibility.







Abstract
Redox reactions on the surface of transition metal oxides are of broad interest in thermo, photo, and electrocatalysis. H2 temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (H2&#8208;TPR) is commonly used to probe oxide reducibility by measuring the rate of H2 consumption during temperature ramps, assuming that this rate is controlled by oxide reduction. However, oxide reduction involves several elementary steps, such as H2 dissociation and H&#8208;spillover, before surface reduction and H2O formation occur. In this study, we evaluated the kinetics of H2 consumption over CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 with varying Pt loadings and structures to identify the elementary steps probed by H2&#8208;TPR. Literature often attributes changes in H2&#8208;TPR characteristics with Pt addition to increased CeO2 reducibility. However, our analysis revealed that the H2 consumption rate is measurement of the rate of H&#8208;spillover at Pt&#8208;CeO2 interfaces and is determined by the concentration of Pt species on Pt nanoclusters that dissociate H2. Therefore, lower temperature H2 consumption observed with Pt addition does not indicate higher CeO2 reducibility. Measurements on samples with mixtures of Pt single&#8208;atoms and nanoclusters demonstrated that H2&#8208;TPR can effectively quantify dilute Pt nanocluster concentrations, suggesting caution in directly linking H2&#8208;TPR characteristics to oxide reducibility while highlighting alternative material insights that can be gleaned.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Amplified Plasma Membrane Rupture by Membrane&#8208;Anchoring NIR&#8208;II Small Molecule Design for Improved Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering approach was employed to yield a series of membrane&#8208;anchoring cationic NIR&#8208;II small molecules, which could amplify plasma membrane rupture by mild NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects, leading to rapid cell necrotic death and enhancing antitumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment method for eradicating tumor cells by enhancing the immune response. However, there are several major obstacles to conventional phototherapy&#8208;mediated immune responses, including inadequate immunogenicity and immunosuppressive environment. Here, we present a novel photoimmunotherapy modality&#8212;the development of membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule inducing plasma membrane rupture (PMR) by NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;stimulation, thus evoking cell necrotic death and enhancing antitumor immunotherapy. Our top&#8208;performing membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule (CBT&#8208;3) exhibits temperature&#8208;tunable PMR efficiency, allowing rapid necrotic death in cancer cells at 50&#8197;&#956;M dose by using exogenous NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated mild photothermal effect (1064&#8197;nm, 0.6&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Further evidence indicated that this gentle therapeutic approach activated inflammatory signaling pathways in cells, enhanced immunogenic cell death, and reshaped the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, ultimately promoting systemic antitumor immune responses in vivo. This study represents the first instance of utilizing NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;amplified PMR effect based on membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule, providing a novel avenue for advancing cancer photoimmunotherapy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, E/Z and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculation elucidate the origin of chiral induction and anti&#8208;selectivity in vinyl&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>[18F]Trifluoroiodomethane &#8211; Enabling Photoredox&#8208;mediated Radical [18F]Trifluoromethylation for Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radiosynthesis of [18F]trifluoroiodomethane is described. CF218FI serves as building block for radical [18F]trifluoromethylation reactions in high molar activity, as exemplified by the Ru&#8208; and photoredox&#8208;mediated synthesis of a range of 18F&#8208;labeled &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl ketones and trifluoromethyl sulfides. This opens new opportunities for the synthesis of [18F]CF3&#8208;containing tracers for positron emission tomography.







Abstract
The development of new tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) is highly dependent on the available synthetic tools for their radiosynthesis. Herein, we present the radiosynthesis and application of [18F]trifluoroiodomethane &#8211; the first reagent for broad scope radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry in high molar activity. CF218FI can be prepared from [18F]fluoroform with 67&#177;5&#8201;% AY and &gt;99&#8201;% RCP. Its synthetic utility is demonstrated by the radiosynthesis of previously unprecedented 18F&#8208;labeled &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl ketones and 18F&#8208;labeled trifluoromethyl sulfides, important motifs that are present in a range of bioactive compounds. Both protocols are Ru&#8208; and photo&#8208;mediated and proceed under mild reaction conditions. They show good functional group tolerance evidenced by the respective reaction scopes and make use of easily obtainable starting materials. The products can be isolated in 8.3&#8211;11.1 GBq/&#956;mol (starting from ca. 5&#160;GBq [18F]fluoride). The applicability to PET tracer synthesis is shown by the radiolabeling of bioactive compounds, such as derivatives of probenecid and febuxostat. In a broader context, this work opens the door to the utilization of radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry for the radiolabeling of PET tracers in high molar activity.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Molecule van der Waals Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons provide opportunities for single&#8208;molecule diodes since they promise unexplored p&#8208;type doped single&#8208;molecule devices. Here, we developed a combined break junction and van der Waals heterojunction methods to fabricate boron&#8208;doped single&#8208;molecule diodes in experiments. With such a strategy, the fabricated single&#8208;molecule diode achieved a rectification ratio as high as 457 at &#177;1&#8197;V.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule diode was the first proposed device in molecular electronics. Despite the great efforts and advances over 50&#8197;years, the reported rectification ratios, the most critical parameter of a diode, remain moderate for the single&#8208;molecule diode. Herein, we report an approach to achieve a larger rectification ratio by adopting the combined strategies of p&#8208;type boron doping, the single&#8208;layer graphene nodes, and the van der Waals layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer architecture. Measured current&#8211;voltage curves showed one of the as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;molecule diodes hit an unprecedented large rectification ratio of 457 at &#177;1&#8197;V. Break junction operations and spectroscopic measurements revealed the three&#8208;atom&#8208;thick configuration of the single&#8208;molecule diodes. With the experimental and theoretical calculation results, we demonstrated the doped boron atoms induced holes to redistribute the electron density, making the asymmetric coupling at positive and negative biases, and the van der Waals interaction promoted asymmetric coupling and significantly boosted diode performance.

         <title>CdWO4 Sub&#8208;1 nm Nanowires for Visible&#8208;Light CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first CdWO4 sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires with rich surface absorbed oleylamine, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects are successfully prepared. The effects of surface adsorption of oleylamine, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects on their electronic structure, light absorption and photocatalytic performance are systematically investigated. This work expands our understanding on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm materials.







Abstract
Quantum size effect usually causes energy level splitting and band broadening as material size decreases. However, this may change again by the surface adsorbents, doping and defects, which rarely attracts much attention. Herein, CdWO4 sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires (SNWs) with oleylamine adsorption, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects are synthesized by combining Cd(CH3COO)2, H3PW12O40 (PW12) and oleylamine (abbreviated as PO43&#8722;&#8208;CdWO4&#8208;X SNWs). Compared with bulk CdWO4, they exhibit unexpected absorption spectra (extended from 292&#8197;nm to 453&#8197;nm) and band gap (reduced from 4.25&#8197;eV to 2.74&#8197;eV), thus bringing remarkable visible&#8208;light CO2 photoreduction activity. Under 410&#8197;nm LED light irradiation, PO43&#8722;&#8208;CdWO4&#8208;40 SNWs exhibit the highest photocatalytic performance with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO generation rate of 1685&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the adsorbed oleylamine raises the valence band and enhances the adsorption of reaction substrate and intermediates, thus decreasing their reduction energy barriers. Furthermore, PO43&#8722;&#8208;doping and oxygen defects will generate defect energy band below the conduction band of PO43&#8722;&#8208;CdWO4&#8208;40 SNWs, resulting in remarkable visible light absorption and superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. This work highlights the significant impacts of surface adsorbents, doping and defects on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of sub&#8208;nano materials.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes with Emission up to 1010&#8197;nm: Synthesis, Structures, and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of perylene&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes (1&#8211;4) have been synthesized and characterized. This design extends the absorption and emission wavelengths of these helical materials into the near&#8208;infrared region, with emission maxima reaching up to 1010&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the helical NGs also show high fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized absorbing or emitting materials offer distinct advantages over their visible&#8208;light counterparts and have attracted considerable interest across various fields. Materials exhibiting NIR chiroptical properties with high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are particularly rare. In this study, we report the synthesis of a series of helical nanographenes (1, 2, 3, and 4), where perylene is fused with one to four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (sub) units by a strategy involving Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition followed by a Scholl reaction. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed their structures, revealing helicene moieties integrated into a highly contorted framework. Benefiting from a similar distribution pattern of frontier molecular orbitals to perylene and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, compounds&#8197;1&#8211;4 demonstrate respectable &#934;F values of 31.9&#8201;%, 15.0&#8201;%, 13.7&#8201;%, and 6.5&#8201;%, respectively, with emission maxima reaching up to 1010&#8197;nm. Their enantiopure forms, isolated by preparative chiral HPLC, exhibit distinct circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence across a broad spectral range, extending from the ultraviolet to the NIR.

         <title>Accelerated Reversible Conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S by Spidroin Regulated Li+ Flux for High&#8208;performance Li&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced Spidroin as a dual functional separator coating to adsorb polysulfides via the sequence of amino acids in its primary structure and regulate Li+ flux through the &#946;&#8208;sheet of its secondary structure, thus accelerating the reversible conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S to improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Regulating the transformation of sulfur species is the key to improving the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, in particular, to accelerate the reversible conversion between solid phase Li2S2 and Li2S. Herein, we introduced Spidroin, which is a main protein in spider silk, as a dual functional separator coating in Li&#8722;S batteries to effectively adsorb polysulfides via the sequence of amino acids in its primary structure and regulate Li+ flux through the &#946;&#8208;sheet of its secondary structure, thus accelerating the reversible transformation between Li2S2 and Li2S. Spidroin&#8208;based Li&#8722;S cells exhibited an exceptional electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 744.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and a high areal capacity of 7.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1 and a sulfur loading of 8.6 mgs cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Asymmetric Modification of Carbazole Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Hybrid Strategy for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric 9H&#8208;thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole (TTID) core based on the hybrid strategy is constructed. With the hybrid thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene unit, the synthesized K1 and KF SAMs show favorable surface wettability, downshifted HOMO energy level, and good defect passivation capability. The fluorine substituent donates high dipole moment for the KF molecule and enhanced device stability. Solar cell with KF exhibits a certified PCE of 25.17&#8201;% and exceptional operational stability.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) are widely applied in inverted perovskite solar cells (iPSCs) due to their unique molecular properties. However, the symmetrical structure of the carbazole&#8208;based SAMs makes it difficult to finely regulate their performance, which impedes the further enhancement of the efficiency and stability of iPSCs. This work demonstrates that by constructing an asymmetric carbazole core, 9H&#8208;thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole) (TTID), the key properties of SAM molecules can be effectively regulated. It has been confirmed that the hybrid thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene unit of this asymmetric core governs the energy level, the surface wettability, and the defect passivation capability of the SAMs, while the substituent of core has a greater impact on the molecular dipole and device stability. The synergistic effects from thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene and fluorine lead to the KF&#8208;derived iPSC demonstrating a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.17&#8201;% and excellent operational stability. This hybrid design concept offers a promising approach for the further structural modification of SAMs in iPSCs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lifespan 522&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Lithium Metal Pouch Cell Enabled by Compound Additives Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high energy density of 522&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and long&#8208;lifespan up to 178&#8197;cycles are achieved for lithium metal batteries just via using a three&#8208;component additive formula. The modifying electrolyte not only enhances the ionic conductivity significantly but also forms robust interfacial films on both electrodes, effectively suppressing electrolyte decomposition. Moreover, it ensures long&#8208;lasting and uniform Li+ regulation, contributing to exceptional cycle stability even under high voltage up to 5.0&#8197;V.







Abstract
Matching high&#8208;voltage cathodes with lithium metal anodes represents the most viable technological approach for developing secondary batteries with ultra&#8208;high energy density exceeding 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Nevertheless, the instability of electrolyte/electrode interface film and commercial electrolytes with cut&#8208;off voltage above 4.3&#8197;V is still a major concern. Herein, we present that excellent cycling stability with an ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 5.0&#8197;V can be obtained by using three&#8208;component additives containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), and tri(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB). Excellent ionic conductivity, robust interfacial films on both electrodes, and long&#8208;lasting uniform Li+ regulation ability can be obtained in the modifying electrolyte. Consequently, using a high plating/stripping capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lithium symmetric cells demonstrate stable cycling performance exceeding 800&#8197;hours. Meanwhile, the 7.3&#8197;Ah&#8208;class Li[NixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;y]O2 (x=0.83, NCM83)|Li pouch cells are assembled, which show a high energy density of 522&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and present excellent stability over 178&#8197;cycles with a high initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.0&#8201;%.

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces, specifically with regard to the effects of confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation, is the focus of this Minireview. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation and achieve new practical applications.







Abstract
With the development of mechanophores, polymer mechanochemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for creating force&#8208;responsive materials with a variety of desired functions, ranging from color change to molecular release. However, it remains challenging to improve the efficiency of mechanochemical activation, especially for mechanophores embedded within polymer networks, which has profound implications for translating mechanochemical responses into materials&#8208;centered applications. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation. In this Minireview, we discuss and summarize recent progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces including surfaces/interfaces, polymer assemblies, and other nanostructures, specifically focusing on the effects of spatial confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation. We envision that combining confinement effects with advances in molecular and materials engineering will further improve the activation efficiency, capitalizing more fully on the potential of mechanophores toward practical applications.

         <dc:description>The Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect&#8208;induced lattice distortion presents an advantageous approach to tailor the electronic structure and CO2 adsorption properties of catalytic centers, consequently conferring desirable photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, achieving precise J&#8208;T distortion control over catalytic sites to enhance CO2 adsorption/activation and target&#8208;product desorption remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we successfully induced J&#8208;T lattice distortion in neighboring Ni sites by exchanging high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni nodes. EXAFS results and DFT simulations revealed that the highly asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes induced structural contraction (shortened Ni&#8208;O bonds) in the adjacent Ni&#8208;O lattice. The magnetic hysteresis loop (M&#8208;H) confirmed that the introduction of Mn2+ increased the number of spin electrons, thereby increasing the magnetization intensity. The spin mismatch between photogenerated electrons and holes suppressed charge recombination. Significantly, the d orbitals of the Ni sites in the Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes exhibited strong orbital hybridization with the p orbitals of CO2, as evidenced by the enhanced d&#8208;p orbital overlap, facilitating rapid CO2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, the sample featuring lattice&#8208;mismatched Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes exhibited an 8.79&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production rate compared to the Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni nodes, in the absence of cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters offer natural advantages for creating power&#8208;efficient, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut OLEDs. However, current green MR&#8208;TADF emitters face challenges in simultaneously achieving high color purity and efficient reverse inter&#8208;system crossing (RISC), leading to suboptimal device performance. In this study, we propose a synergistic molecular design approach that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral locking to address these challenges. This approach allows for the construction of quadruple borylated MR&#8208;TADF emitters that not only deliver precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15 nm, but also exhibit close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield, rapid RISC, and optimal horizontal dipole orientation. The resulting sensitizer&#8208;free OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% at maximum and 31.8% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2. Additionally, the device shows good operational stability, with a lifetime (LT80) of 485 hours at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&#8208;2. This study hence offers a promising molecular design strategy that effectively enhances the comprehensive OLED performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a promising solution for global hydrogen infrastructure, but their practical application faces two key challenges: sluggish dehydrogenation processes and the reliance on catalysts with high noble metal loadings. This study presents a scalable approach to reduce noble metal usage while maintaining high catalytic activity. We synthesized an ultralow Pt content (0.1 wt%) catalyst using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;based pellet support with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that the thin ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell provides a heterogeneous interface, confining electronically rich Pt&#8208;nanoparticle ensembles. The catalyst outperforms both equivalent Pt&#8208;content catalysts and a commercial 0.5 wt% Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst in homocyclic LOHC dehydrogenation. This study provides insights into the beneficial role of ALD&#8208;engineered interfaces for catalytic supports and offers an efficient approach for scalable production of low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;content catalysts, with implications for various catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowing the exact location of the semiconductor band&#8208;edges is key for mechanistic insights into their use for water and CO2 photo/electrocatalysis. In this regard, a reliable strategy for nano&#8208;semiconductors did not exist yet. We demonstrate the use of reversible redox probes on nano&#8208;semiconductor electrodes to determine their band&#8208;edge locations in aqueous solutions. Rectifying current&#8208;potential (i&#8208;U) characteristics with the high work function Fe(CN)63&#8208;/Fe(CN)64&#8208; redox couple yielded the exact flatband potential at various pH whereas the reversible i&#8208;U characteristics with the low work function Ru(NH3)63+/Ru(NH3)62+ redox couple provided the conduction band&#8208;edge location and dopant concentration for a 30nm thin&#8208;film n&#8208;TiO2. The methodology can be extended to other nano&#8208;semiconductors and serves as an alternative to and goes beyond the capabilities of the Mott&#8208;Schottky procedure for bulk semiconductor electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Interface Dipole Interaction between Ethers and Active Species toward Highly Stable Li&#8208;SPAN Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is recognized as a promising organic cathode for long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries. Nevertheless, the irreversible cleavage/formation of multiple sulfur&#8208;sulfur (S&#8208;S) bonds of SPAN within conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes results in loss of active S species, severe capacity fading and shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a new electrolyte based on dipropyl ether (PE) solvent for Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. Benefiting from the particular chain&#8208;coordination structure and weak dipole interactions with Li+ and active species, the resulting electrolyte not only achieves low desolvation energy barrier and high Li+ transference number, but also displays stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface (EEI). Consequently, the full cells utilizing this electrolyte exhibit good cyclability, outstanding capacity retention and superior extreme&#8208;temperature (&#8208;50&#176;C to 50 &#176;C) performance. Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with lean electrolyte (2.5 g Ah&#8208;1) achieves record cycle stability with 96.5% capacity retention after 75 cycles, which deliver an initial specific energy density of 150 Wh kg&#8208;1 (based on the weight of the entire cell). Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of organic electrodes employing with PE&#8208;based electrolytes. This work highlights the strategy for modulating the dipole interaction at EEI for long&#8208;lifespan Li&#8208;organic batteries at extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Driven by Multi&#8208;Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, poor stability and an unfavorable freezing point hinder their actual application. Herein, a ternary salts&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn0.2Na0.4Li0.4(ClO4)1.2&#183;7H2O is proposed to address the above issues. The addition of perchlorate salts with different cations reduces the size of ion clusters, significantly increases the solvation structure species, and promotes the anion&#8208;rich Zn2+ solvation structures, resulting in an enlarged electrochemical stability window, favorable viscosity and ionic conductivity, and low freezing point. Furthermore, characterization and calculations confirm that multiple types of solvation structures effectively increase the electrolyte entropy. As a consequence, the Zn/Zn symmetric cells in HEE can sustainably cycle for at least 1000 hours and 1500 hours under room and subzero temperatures, respectively. The Na0.33V2O5/Zn and polyaniline/Zn full cells can even last for 30000 and 20000 cycles without capacity decay at &#8722;20 &#176;C, respectively. The pouch cells employing HEE deliver promising capacity and stability, even at high mass loading of active materials. This strategy of introducing multiple salts with different cations to construct a high&#8208;entropy environment provides a facile approach for high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs across a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Elastic Single&#8208;Atom Protrusions Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) generation, but the eNRR efficiency is dramatically impeded by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, inspired by the dynamic extension&#8208;contraction of sea anemone tentacles in response to environmental changes, we propose a biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion on vanadium oxide support (pSA Mo/VOH) electrocatalyst featuring a symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo site and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramid for efficient eNRR. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the protruding Mo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking structure optimizes the d electron filling of Mo, enhancing the back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* antibonding orbital, effectively polarizing the N&#8801;N bond and reducing the barrier from *N2 to *N2H. Notably, the elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure of pSA Mo provides a dynamic Mo&#8722;O microenvironment during continuous eNRR processes. This optimizes the electronic structure of the Mo sites based on different reaction intermediates, enhancing the adsorption of various N intermediates and maintaining low barriers throughout the six&#8208;step hydrogenation process. Consequently, the elastic pSA Mo/VOH exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate of 50.71 &#177; 1.12 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 35.38 &#177; 1.03%, outperforming most electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesis of Synergistic Single&#8208;Atom/Nanocluster Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing catalysts that simultaneously containing single atom/metal nanocluster active sites is a promising strategy to enhance the original catalytic behavior and accelerate the catalysis involving multi&#8208;electron reactions or multi&#8208;intermediates. Herein, the pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic method is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The controllable pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy allows the precise modulation of the active centers, realizing the optimization of the adsorption energy and the regulation of the synergistic active components. Specially, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2 of 25 mV and 8.6 mV, respectively, combining with outstanding durability towards high current density and methanol poisoning. This work developed a universal synthetic strategy for the single atom/nanocluster synergy systems and further demonstrated the superiority of heterogeneous components.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Single Atom&#8208;supported Covalent Organic Frameworks for Aqueous&#8208;phase Hydrogenative Hydrogenolysis of Aromatic Aldehydes via Hydrogen Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a method for the tandem hydrogenative hydrogenolysis of bio&#8208;based furfuryl aldehydes to methylfurans is crucial for synthesizing sustainable biofuels and chemicals; however, it poses a challenge due to the easy hydrogenation of the C=C bond and difficult cleavage of the C&#8211;O bond. Herein, a palladium (Pd) single&#8208;atom&#8208;supported covalent organic framework was fabricated and showed a unique 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran yield of up to 98.2% when reacted with 5&#8208;methyl furfuryl aldehyde in an unprecedented water solvent at 30&#176;C. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent catalytic universality while converting various furfuryl&#8208;, benzyl&#8208;, and heterocyclic aldehydes at room temperature. The analysis of the catalytic mechanism confirmed that H2 was heterolytically activated on the Pd&#8211;N pair and triggered the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) host, resulting in H&#8211;&#8211;Pd&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O&#8211;H+ sites. These sites served as novel asymmetric hydrogenation sites for the C=O group and hydrogenolysis sites for the C&#8211;OH group through a scarce SN2 mechanism. This study demonstrated remarkable bifunctional catalysis through the H2&#8208;induced keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of COF catalysts for the atypical preparation of methyl aromatics in a water solvent at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Spring&#8208;Like Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes Experiencing Giant and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion Across Two Distinct Temperature Regimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic molecules with tunable chemical and physical properties in response to external stimuli hold great potential for applications in information storage, smart molecular machines, and biomimetics. Among them, supramolecular springs and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes can both undergo visible macroscopic changes under heat or light stimulation. In this study, we synthesized a trinuclear Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex, [(R&#8208;L)FeII{Au(CN)2}2] (R1), using a chiral chelating ligand decorated with rotatable benzyl rings. The [FeAu2] trinuclear molecules form a 21&#8208;helical supramolecular chain via elastic Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au contacts. Interestingly, the synergy between the multiple dynamic factors (SCO event, rotation of the rings, and flexibility in Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au distance) endows the complex with multiple switchings in both magnetism and structure, as well as the most intriguing characteristic of giant and anisotropic &#8220;breathing&#8221; feature in thermal expansion within two distinct temperature regimes. Specifically, complex R1 undergoes two hysteretic magnetic transitions: a non&#8208;spin transition and an unsymmetric SCO transition. Both transitions are triggered/accompanied by the rotation of the benzyl rings. Correspondingly, reversible spring&#8208;like motions of the helical chains are observed in the two distinct temperature regimes. This work demonstrates a significant success in incorporating both SCO and spring&#8208;like motion in one system, paving the way for designing multifunctional dynamic materials for future devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine: Attractive scaffold for highly selective inhibitors of underexplored protein kinases with variable binding mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases are key regulators of numerous biological processes and aberrant kinase activity can cause various diseases, particularly cancer. Herein, we report the identification of new series of highly selective kinase inhibitors based on the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold. The weak interaction of the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine core with the kinase hinge region allows for profoundly different binding modes all of which maintain high kinome&#8208;wide selectivity, as illustrated by the isomers MU1464 and MU1668. Thus, this core structure provides a template of ATP&#8208;competitive but not ATP&#8208;mimetic inhibitors that are anchored at the kinase back pocket. Mapping the chemical space around the central thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine pharmacophore afforded highly selective inhibitors of the kinase Haspin, exemplified by the compound MU1920 that fulfils criteria for a quality chemical probe and is suitable for use in in vivo applications. However, despite the role of Haspin in mitosis, the inhibition of Haspin alone was not sufficient to elicit cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. The thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold can be used in a broader context, as a basis of inhibitors targeting other underexplored protein kinases, such as CDKLs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a robust strategy for tuning the electronic structure and chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs). By fusing two cyclopentadienyl rings in the peri&#8208;tetracene bay regions, we introduce antiaromatic character into the &#960;&#8208;system, leading to unique photophysical and electronic properties. A stable mesityl&#8208;substituted dicyclopenta&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracene derivative was synthesized through stepwise formylation/intramolecular cyclization at the bay regions of the dihydro peri&#8208;tetracene precursor, followed by oxidative dehydrogenation. This compound features an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, global antiaromaticity, exceptional stability under ambient conditions, and amphoteric redox behavior with a small energy gap. Its dication also possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and its structure was identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, revealing a unique [14]annulene&#8208;within&#8208;[22]annulene global aromatic structure. In contrast, the dianion exhibits a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state. This work provides valuable insights for designing and synthesizing novel open&#8208;shell PHs with tunable electronic structures and remarkable stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Tandem Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Systems Based on Structure Adaption to Boost Water Contaminant Mineralization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art water purification technology in addressing water saftey. A conceptualizaiton of tandem reaction system based on structure adaption of target contaminants to reactive oxygen species reactivity was firstly proposed to boost the mineralization of emerging contaminants, which may serve as cost&#8208;attractive mode to design green and high&#8208;efficiency AOPs for advanced water treatment.







Abstract
Mineralization of emerging contaminants by using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is a desirable option to ensure water safety, but still challenged by the excessive chemical and/or energy input. Here, we conceptually proposed the tandem reaction system (TRS) of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on structure adaption of target contaminants. To construct a model TRS, we first realized highly selective generation of three classical ROS (1O2, HO&#8901; and SO4&#8901;&#8722;) by peroxymonosulfate activation in an electrochemical Fenton&#8208;like system, where three replaceable Fe&#8208;centered cathodes were rationally designed as electronic mediator. The 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS exhibited nearly 100&#8201;% mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), whereas only 34.2&#8201;%, 56.2&#8201;% and 60.8&#8201;% for each of the single 1O2/HO&#8901;/SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;AOP systems. Mechanism exploration of SMX degradation in TRS evidenced that the initial reaction with 1O2 selectively destructed the sulfonamide bridge of SMX to form p&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which will be vulnerable to sequent SO4&#8901;&#8722; attack to facilitate mineralization. Successful extendibility of 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS to other sulfonamide antibiotics and 1O2+HO&#8901;&#8208;TRS to phenolic and arylcarboxylic compounds, as well as the demonstration of 1O2+SO4&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;TRS in treatment of three actual pharmaceutical wastewaters strongly support that TRS is a powerful and sustainable strategy to enhance the mineralization of emerging contaminants in water.

         <title>Modulating the Aggregation States of a Pd6L4 Cage for Selectivity Flipping during the Stereo&#8208;Divergent Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic system has been established using a singular palladium&#8208;based octahedral cage as the supramolecular reactor, deftly unlocking off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Water serves as a critical regulator, modulating the catalyst states, reaction rates, and endpoints. The choice of solvent system influences the activity of host&#8208;guest binding and the reaction types of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, effectively modifying the reaction steps involved in the Z&#8594;E isomerization during the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Kinetic and inhibition experiments indicate that the catalyst mimics the binding and activation characteristics of enzymes towards substrates, enabling selective transformations within the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment. The utility of this switchable cage&#8208;confined catalysis has been demonstrated in the synthesis and modification of complex biologically active molecules with controllable E/Z selectivity. This work sheds light on the design and control of artificial supramolecular counterparts of enzymes, offering fundamental insights into the factors influencing the activity and catalytic selectivity of biological macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Vertically Expanded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation into Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks with unique &#960; architectures and pores could be developed as photocatalysts for transformations. However, they usually form &#960;&#8208;stacking layers, so that only surface layers function in photocatalysis. Here we report a strategy for developing vertically expanded frameworks to expose originally inaccessible active sites hidden in layers to catalysis. We designed covalently linked two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) porphyrin layers and explored coordination bonds to connect the cobalt(II) porphyrin layers with bidentate ligands via a three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot polymerization. The frameworks expand the interlayer space greatly, where both the up and down faces of each cobalt(II) porphyrin layer are exposed to reactants. Unexpectedly, the vertically expanded frameworks increase skeleton oxidation potentials, decrease exciton dissociation energy, improve pore hydrophilicity and affinity to water, and facilitate water delivery. Remarkably, these positive effects work collectively in the photocatalysis of water oxidation into oxygen, with an oxygen production rate of 1155 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, a quantum efficiency of 1.24% at 450 nm, and a turnover frequency of 1.39 h&#8722;1, which is even 5.1&#8208;fold as high as that of the &#960;&#8208;stacked frameworks and ranks them the most effective photocatalysts. This strategy offers a new platform for designing layer frameworks to build various catalytic systems for chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Chain Rearrangement of Natural Cellulose&#8208;based Artificial Interphase for Ultra&#8208;stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unstable electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, plagued by parasitic side reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth, severely hampers the practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To address these challenges, we developed a regenerated cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase with synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry on the Zn anode (RC@Zn), using a facile molecular chain rearrangement strategy. This RC interphase features a drastically increased amorphous region and more exposed active hydroxyl groups, facilitating rapid Zn2+ diffusion&#160;and homogeneous Zn2+ interface distribution, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Additionally, the compact texture and abundant negatively charged surface of the RC interphase effectively shield water molecules and harmful anions, completely preventing H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. The superior mechanical strength and adhesion of the RC interphase also accommodate the substantial volume changes of Zn anodes even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently,&#160;the RC@Zn electrode demonstrates an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000 hours at a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Significantly, the electrode maintains stable cycling even at a 90% depth of discharge and ensures stable operation of full cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.6. This study provides new solution to construct highly stable and deep cycling Zn metal anodes through interface engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami-inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three-dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double-corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure- and guest-induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve-adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terminal Fluorination Modulates Crystallinity and Aggregation of Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High dark current density (Jd) severely hinders further advancement of near&#8208;infrared organic photodetectors (NIR OPDs). Herein, we tackle this grand challenge by regulating molecular crystallinity and aggregation of fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (FNREAs). In contrast to the general trend in terminal halogenation of electron acceptors, TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, featuring fluorinated terminals, notably demonstrates crystalline intensification and a higher prevalence predominance of J&#8208;aggregate compared to its chlorinated counterpart (TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl). The amalgamation of advantages confers TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs with more organized active layer morphology and denser molecular packing, resulting in improved charge transport, decreased energetic disorder, and reduced trap density. Consequently, the corresponding self&#8208;powered OPDs exhibit a 40&#8208;fold decrease in Jd, a remarkable increase in detectivity (D*sh), faster response time, and superior thermal stability compared to TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl&#8208;based OPDs. Further interfacial optimization results in an ultra&#8208;low Jd of 7.30&#180;10&#8208;12 A cm&#8208;2 with D*sh over 1013 Jones in 320&#8208;920 nm wavelength and a climax of 2.2&#180;1014 Jones at 800 nm for the TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs, representing one of the best results reported to date. This work paves a compelling material&#8208;based strategy to suppress Jd for highly sensitive NIR OPDs, while also illustrates the viability of FNREAs in construction of stable and affordable NIR OPDs for real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Cumulene Character of One&#8208;Dimensional Acetylene&#8208;Based Systems by Stimuli&#8208;Induced Planarization of Their Two Pro&#8208;diradicaloid Cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene Units</title>

         <dc:description>Acetylene/polyynes &#8211;(C&#8801;C&#8211;)n and cumulenes =(C=)n are connectors widely used for the realization of one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) &#960;&#8208;conjugates. Although both &#960;&#8208;moieties are constituted by sp carbon atoms, their different bond connectivity confers distinct physicochemical properties to the resulting systems. In this context, while many acetylene/polyyne&#8208; and cumulene&#8208;based derivatives have been prepared and studied, no reports have tackled the possibility to reversibly alter the acetylene/polyyne&#8208;cumulene electronic character of these derivatives using mild conditions. Herein, we present a novel approach to enhance the cumulene character of 1&#8208;D acetylene&#8208;based conjugates consisting in the preparation of derivatives featuring an acetylene moiety connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene (CPA), at their pro&#8208;radical positions. A thoughtful spectroscopic study of the prepared dimers, complemented by theoretical calculations, suggest a high &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization of the pro&#8208;diradicaloid CPAs through the central acetylene spacer upon the dimers&#8217; planarization which, in turn, increases the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge, a feature enhanced for one of the two dimers at low temperature and in methylcyclohexane due to an aggregation&#8208;induced planarization process. We reckon that the proposed approach offers an interesting avenue towards the realization of 1&#8208;D systems which cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;connector could be altered in response to external stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea/Thiourea Imine Linkages Provide Accessible Holes in Flexible Covalent Organic Frameworks and Dominates Self&#8208;Adaptivity and Exciton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the robust self&#8208;adaptivity and minimal energy&#8208;dissipation of soft reticular materials for environmental catalysis presents a compelling yet unexplored avenue. Herein, a top&#8208;down strategy, tailoring from the unique linkage basis, flexibility degree, skeleton electronics to trace&#8208;guest adaptability, is proposed to fill the understanding gap between micro&#8208;soft covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and photocatalytic performance. The thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene&#8208;based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro&#8208;flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro&#8208;flexible thiourea&#8208;COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100% removal of micropollutant with low&#8208;energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes&#8208;mediated micropollutant decomposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Comediating Adsorption and Electron Transfer via Dual&#8208;Active Site Catalyst Construction for Improving the Treatment of Extraction Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent extraction is widely applied, while extraction wastewater treatment remains a huge&#160;challenge&#160;because of the stability of extractants.&#160;Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis is a promising method, but the short half&#8208;life of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH)&#160;generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#160;activation results in unsatisfactory &#8226;OH utilization and organics removal.&#160;Herein, an efficient strategy for treating extraction wastewater based on comediating adsorption and electron transfer by fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active site was developed. Specially, N sites adsorb organics and&#160;F&#160;sites activate&#160;H2O2, shortening the migration distance&#160;of &#8226;OH. Theoretical calculation and di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA)&#160;extraction wastewater degradation experiment&#160;showed that F site&#160;with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by electron&#8208;rich D2EHPA enriched at N sites to&#160;H2O2,&#160;facilitating the continuous generation of &#8226;OH through lowering the energy barrier for H2O2&#160;activation.&#160;As a result, 96.49% D2EHPA in simulated wastewater&#160;and 90.26% total organic carbon&#160;in real&#160;extraction wastewater&#160;were removed. Moreover, FNC catalyst&#160;exhibited excellent reusability and ionic adaptability, and can be extended to the removal of various extractants. The proposed dual&#8208;active site catalyst provides&#160;an effective strategy&#160;for&#160;Fenton&#8208;like&#160;reaction&#160;to&#160;treat&#160;refractory extraction wastewater, promoting&#160;sustainable development of solvent extraction industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8211;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8211;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive Fabrication of a Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Catalyst toward Highly Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as burgeoning heterogeneous catalysts due to their vast material space, unique structure, and superior stability. However, the dominant trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches hamper the exploration of efficient catalysts, necessitating the development of rational design strategies. Here, we report a progressive approach to the design and fabrication of HEA catalysts guided by alloying effects toward propane dehydrogenation. Cu, Sn, Au, and Pd are selected and demonstrated to induce dilution, encapsulation, surface enrichment, and inhomogeneity effects on Pt. The fabricated HEA, PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability. The propylene formation rates reach 256 and 390 molC3H6 gPt&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 550 and 600 &#176;C, respectively. Systematic characterizations reveal that the random elemental mixing, structural stability, and high Pt exposure promote the exposure of abundant stable isolated Pt sites. This work comprehensively explores the rational design and fabrication of HEA catalysts from a unique perspective, offering opportunities for developing advanced catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of&#160;Covalent Organic Frameworks with Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt for C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received great attention for their unique features, but the limited building blocks restrict their structural diversity and performance exploration. Reticular chemistry provides guidance for the structural expansion and performance regulation of COFs. Herein, we constructed two novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs functionalized with cyclopentadienyl cobalt, denoted as UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;2, via [4+2] imine condensation with diamine building blocks of different length. Theoretical simulations combined with experimental results reveal that UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with shorter building blocks, narrower pore sizes, and stronger host&#8208;guest interactions has better C2H2/CO2 separation performance. In addition, UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 can maintain separation stability in the presence of water vapor and methane impurities. This work provides a new evidence for the performance regulation of isoreticular COFs with modular and tunable building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer Enabled 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group translocation is undoubtedly a pivotal synthetic transformation in organic chemistry. Numerous types of reactions involving radical 1,2&#8208;aryl or 1,4&#8208;aryl migration via electron transfer mechanism have been extensively investigated. Nevertheless, energy&#8208;transfer enabled 1,4&#8208;arylation remains unknown. Herein we disclose that an unprecedented di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement featuring 1,4&#8208;aryl migration facilitated by energy transfer catalysis under visible light conditions. The newly developed mild protocol exhibits tolerance towards diverse functional groups and enables the migration of a multitude of aromatic rings, encompassing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;rich functional groups. The open&#8208;shell strategy has also found successful application in the modification of several drugs. Large&#8208;scale experiments, continuous&#8208;flow experiment, and versatile manipulation of products have demonstrated the robustness and potential utility of this synthetic method. Preliminary mechanistic studies have supported the involvement of radical species in this di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement and have also provided evidence for the energy transfer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;atom Barium Promoter Enormously Enhanced Non&#8208;noble Metal Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a well&#8208;established topic, single&#8208;atom catalyst has drawn growing interest for its high utilization of metal. However, researchers prefer to develop various active metals with single&#8208;atom form, the intrinsic roles of single&#8208;atom promoters are usually underrated, which are significant in boosting reaction activity. In this work, Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8208;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor under the ammonia decomposition reaction condition. The optimized Co&#8208;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst achieves extremely high H2 production rate of 138.3 mmolH2&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;min&#8722;1 at very low temperature (500 &#176;C, GHSV = 840,000 mL&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) and Co&#8208;Ba/Y2O3 exhibits excellent durability during the 350 h test, which realizes the highest activity among all non&#8208;noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Both Y2O3 and Co demonstrate positive interactions with Ba, which significantly facilitates the dispersion of Ba species at high temperatures (&#8805; 600 &#176;C). Ba single atoms significantly enhance the charge density of Co and form additionally active Co&#8208;O&#8208;Ba&#8208;Y2O3 interfacial sites, which alleviates hydrogen poisoning and decreases the reaction barrier of the N&#8208;H bond activation of *NH. The exploration of atomically dispersed promoters is groundbreaking in heterogeneous catalysis, which opens up a whole new domain of catalytic material.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol based on a Molecule/Nanocarbon Hybrid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion provides an intriguing route for both solar energy storage and CO2 mitigation. For scalable applications, near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity is highly desirable to reduce the energy and cost endowed by low&#8208;value byproducts and complex separation processes, but so far has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate a molecule/nanocarbon hybrid catalyst composed of carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc/CNT), which synergistically integrates high photothermal conversion capability for affording an optimal reaction temperature with homogeneous and intrinsically&#8208;efficient active sites, to achieve a catalytic activity of 2.4 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and selectivity of ~99% in direct photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Both theoretical calculations and operando characterizations consistently confirm that the unique electronic structure of CoPc and appropriate reaction temperature cooperatively enable a thermodynamic favorable reaction pathway for highly selective methanol production. This work represents an important milestone towards the development of advanced photothermal catalysts for scalable and cost&#8208;effective CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Framework with Dense Lithiophilic Sites as Protective Layer to Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries with remarkable energy densities are restrained by short lifetime and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), resulting from the accumulative Li dendrites and dead Li during cycling. Here, we prepared a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with dense lithiophilic sites (heteoatom weight contents of 32.32wt%) as an anodic protective layer of Li metal batteries. The 3D COF was synthesized using a [6+4] synthesis strategy by inducing flexible 6&#8208;connected cyclotriphosphazene derivative aldehyde and 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based tetraphenylamines. Both phosphazene and porphyrin rings in the COF served as electron&#8208;rich and lithiophilic sites, enhancing a homogeneous Li+ flux via 3D direction towards highly smooth and compact Li deposition. The Li/Por&#8208;PN&#8208;COF&#8208;Cu cells achieved a record average CE of 99.1% for 320 cycles with smooth Li deposition. Meanwhile, the abundant lithiophilic sites can promote fast Li+ transport with Li+ transference number of 0.87, enabling LiFePO4 full cell with stable stripping/plating processes even at a harsh rate of 5 C. Theoretical calculations revealed that the strong interaction force between Li+ and the COF facilitated the dissolution of Li+ from the electrolyte, and the low migration barrier of 1.08 eV indicated a favorable interaction between the Li+ ions and the &#960;&#8208;electron system.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Water Restriction in Ternary Eutectic Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hydrogen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage in extreme conditions due to the small ionic radius and efficient transport of protons. Hydrogen gas, with its low working potentials, fast kinetics, and stability, further enhances the performance of proton batteries but necessitates the development of novel electrolytes with low freezing points and reduced corrosion. This work introduces a localized water restriction strategy by incorporating a tertiary component with a high donor number, which forms strong bonds with water molecules. This approach restricts free water molecules and reduces the average hydrogen bond ratio and strength. As&#8208;prepared ternary eutectic electrolytes lowered the freezing point to &#8722;103 &#176;C, significantly lower than the traditional binary electrolyte (9.5 m H3PO4, &#8722;93 &#176;C). This electrolyte is highly compatible with the Cu0.79Co0.21[Fe(CN)6]0.64&#183;4H2O (CoCuHCF) cathode, reducing material dissolution and current collector corrosion. The H2||CoCuHCF battery using this electrolyte demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 23664.3 W kg&#8722;1, excellent performance at &#8722;80 &#176;C, and stable cyclability over 1000 cycles (&gt; 30 days)&#160; at &#8722;50 &#176;C. These findings provide a framework for proton electrolytes, highlighting the potential of hydrogen batteries in challenging environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Framework&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) hold substantial therapeutic potential for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, their potential remains largely untapped due to the challenges of cytosolic delivery. Inspired by the dynamic, spiky architecture of coronavirus, an interface engineering approach based on a tetrahedral DNA framework (tDF) is demonstrated for the development of coronavirus&#8208;mimicking SNAs. By exploiting their robustness and precise construction, tDFs are evenly arranged on the surface of core nanoparticles (NPs) with flexible conformations, generating a dynamic, spiky architecture. This spiky architecture in tetrahedral DNA framework&#8208;based SNAs (tDF&#8208;SNAs) substantially improve siRNAs duplex efficiency from 20% to 95%. Meanwhile, tDF&#8208;SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin&#8208;independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF&#8208;SNAs is 1&#8208;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold increase in gene silencing efficacy. These results show promise in the development of bioinspired siRNAs delivery systems for intracellular applications.</dc:description>

Meanwhile, tDF-SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin-independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF-SNAs is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2-fold increase in gene silencing efficacy.

         <title>Early Detection of High&#8208;altitude Hypoxic Brain Injury by In Vivo Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI) is a kind of acute mountain sickness and the survival rate of patients with HHBI can be improved only if it is detected and treated at the early stage. However, limited by speediness and accuracy, it is still very difficult for most of current approaches to realize the early detection of HHBI. We propose herein a novel strategy for this goal based on spatiotemporal changes in the brain oxygen level. As revealed by in vivo electrochemistry, the characteristic changes of brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure are directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the degree of HHBI can be diagnosed by the variation of brain oxygen, making the early detection of HHBI feasible. In addition, the risk of HHBI for mouse exposed to high&#8208;altitude hypoxia environments can be also prognosed days in advance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Bartoli Indole Synthesis by the Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes with Nitro(hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the unique charm of dipole chemistry, intercepting N&#8208;O=C dipoles precisely generated by designed processes to develop novel reactivity has become a seminal challenge. The polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species generated through the radical addition of excited nitro(hetero)arenes to alkenes represents a significantly underappreciated mechanism for generating N&#8208;O=C dipoles. Herein, we present a photoinduced Bartoli indole synthesis by the oxidative cleavage of alkenes with nitro(hetero)arenes. Various indoles and azaindoles are constructed through the multi&#8208;step spontaneous rearrangement of carbonyl imine intermediates generated by the polar fragmentation of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine species. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations support that the reaction involves radical cycloaddition, ozonolysis&#8208;type cycloreversion, intramolecular H&#8208;shift of carbonyl imines, and 3,3&#8208;sigmatropic shift of O&#8208;Alkenyl hydroxylamines, etc. The implementation of continuous&#8208; flow photochemistry, in particular, significantly enhances efficiency, thereby overcoming obstacles to the commercialization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning proton affinity on Co&#8211;N&#8211;C atomic interface to disentangle activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in acidic oxygen reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In oxygen reduction reaction to H2O2via two&#8208;electron pathway (2e&#8208; ORR), adsorption strength of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates determines both catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it also causes activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we propose a novel strategy through modulating the interaction between protons and *OOH intermediates to break the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for highly active and selective 2e&#8208; ORR. Taking the typical cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalyst as an example, boron heteroatoms doped into second coordination sphere of CoN4 (Co1&#8208;NBC) increase proton affinity on catalyst surface, facilitating proton attack on the former oxygen of *OOH and thereby promoting H2O2 formation. As a result, Co1&#8208;NBC simultaneously achieves prominent 2e&#8208; ORR activity and selectivity in acid with onset potential of 0.724 V vs. RHE and H2O2 selectivity of 94%, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, Co1&#8208;NBC exhibits a record&#8208;high H2O2 productivity of 202.7 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and a remarkable stability of 60 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2 in flow cell. This work provides new insights into resolving activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cycloheptadienones Starting from Phenols and Using a Rhodium/Boron Asymmetric Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing offers a unique route to assemble complex architectures from simple feedstocks that are otherwise difficult to obtain. However, the asymmetric version of skeletal editing has not been widely studied. Herein, we present a modular rhodium/boron asymmetric catalytic system that enables ring&#8208;expansion of phenols with cyclopropenes to synthesize highly functionalized cycloheptadienones in excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities. This unique protocol features with low&#8208;catalyst loading, atom and step&#8208;economies, and mild neutral reaction conditions. Isotope&#8208;labelling experiments and DFT calculations have been conducted to reveal that boron reagent plays a vital role in the whole catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocycle Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Amphoteric Organic Superstructures for Superior Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple redox&#8208;active amphoteric organics with more n&#8208;p fused electron transfer is an ongoing pursuit for superior zinc&#8722;organic batteries (ZOBs). Here we report multi&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;site donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures (AOSs) by integrating three&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type triazine motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type piperazine units via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. AOSs expose flower&#8208;shaped N&#8208;heteromacrocyclic electron delocalization topologies to promise full accessibility of built&#8208;in n&#8208;p redox&#8208;active motifs with an ultralow activation energy, thus liberating superior capacity (465 mAh g&#8722;1) for Zn||AOSs battery. More importantly, the extended multiple donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;fused conjugated AOSs feature satisfied discharge voltage and anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, pushing both the energy density and cycle life of the ZOBs to a new level (412 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles@10 A g&#8722;1). An anion&#8722;cation hybrid 18 e&#8722; charge storage mechanism is rationalized for heteromacrocyclic modules of AOSs cathode, entailing six tert&#8208;N motifs coupling with CF3SO3&#8722; ions at high potential and twelve imine sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential. These findings constitute a major advance of amphoteric multielectron organic materials and stand for a good starting point for advanced ZOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides Facilitates Stereospecific SuFEx Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;centered electrophilic 'warheads' have emerged as key components for chemical proteomic probes through sulfur&#8208;exchange chemistry (SuFEx) with protein nucleophiles. Among these functional groups, sulfonimidoyl fluorides (SIFs) stand out for their modifiable sites, tunable electrophilicities, and chiral sulfur&#8208;center, presenting exciting possibilities for new covalent chemical probes. However, the synthetic access to chiral SIFs has been a challenge, limiting their exploration and applications. In this study, we describe a convenient route to obtain chiral SIFs from readily available sulfenamides via a series of one&#8208;pot tandem reactions with high enantiomeric excess (ees). The resulting chiral SIFs were further converted into a diverse array of chiral S(VI) derivatives under mild conditions or in buffer solutions. Most significantly, the specificity of the chiral SIFs in protein ligation experiments underscored the critical role of sulfur&#8208;center chirality in the design and screening of more&#8208;selective covalent probes and therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Dication Disulfuranes as Photoactivatable Sources of Radical Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent development of photoredox and energy transfer catalysis has led to a significant expansion of visible light&#8208;driven chemical transformations. These methods have demonstrated exceptional efficiency in converting a wide range of substrates into radical intermediates and generating open&#8208;shell catalytic species. However, the simplification of catalytic systems and the direct generation of highly reactive radical organocatalysts through direct visible light irradiation from stable precatalysts remains largely an unrealized goal. This challenge is mainly due to the limited availability of precatalysts that are responsive to visible light. Herein, we introduce a new class of bench&#8208;stable dicationic disulfuranes, which release highly reactive thiyl radicals upon blue light excitation. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that this reactivity arises from a combination of structural features and intermolecular interactions. This family of molecules has been employed to catalyze radical cascades previously incompatible with photoredox conditions, enabling the efficient formation of 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;hydroxyketones in excellent yields and short reaction times.</dc:description>

         <title>I3&#8208;&#8208;Mediated Oxygen Evolution Activities to Boost Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance with Low Charging Voltage and Long Cycling Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to facilitate oxygen redox chemistry in metal&#8208;air batteries is to introduce a redox mediator into the liquid electrolyte. The rational utilization of redox mediators to accelerate the charging kinetics while ensuring the long lifetime of alkaline Zn&#8208;air batteries is challenging. Here, we apply commercial acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3&#8208;&#8208;mediated Zn&#8208;air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3&#8208; to accelerate the cathodic redox chemistry and regulate the uniform deposition of Zn2+ on the anode. The Zn&#8208;air battery performs an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 600 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 with a final charge voltage of 1.87 V. We demonstrate that I&#8208; mainly generates I3&#8208; on the surface of carbon catalysts during the electrochemically charging process, which can further chemically react with OH&#8208; to generate oxygen and further revert to I&#8208;, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system. This work offers a strategy to simultaneously improve the cycling life and reduce the charging voltage of Zn&#8208;air batteries through redox mediator methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming the Dynamic Range of Nanochannel Biosensors for MicroRNA Detection through Allosteric DNA Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors are extensively utilized for microRNA detection owing to their high sensitivity and rapid response. However, conventional nanochannel biosensors face limitations in their fixed dynamic range, restricting their versatility and efficacy. Herein, we introduce tunable tri&#8208;block DNA probes with varying affinities for target miRNA to engineer solid&#8208;state nanochannel biosensors capable of programmable dynamic range adjustment. The tri&#8208;block DNA architecture comprises a poly&#8208;adenine (polyA) block for adjustable surface density anchoring, alongside stem and loop blocks for modulating structural stability. Through systematic manipulation of these blocks, we demonstrate the ability to achieve diverse target binding affinities and detection limits, achieving an initial 81&#8208;fold dynamic range. By combining probes with different affinities, we extend this dynamic range significantly to 10,900&#8208;fold. Furthermore, by implementing a sequestration mechanism, the effective dynamic range of the nanochannel biosensor was narrowed to only a 3&#8208;fold range of target concentrations. The customizable dynamic range of these advanced nanochannel biosensors makes them highly promising for a broad spectrum of biomedical and clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom efficient method of producing diborane from borohydride sources has been provided. Ionic liquids provide a controlled source of boron trifluoride which acts as a Lewis acid to release diborane. The EMIM generated from the ionic liquid also burns effectively in air making a highly efficient fuel source which combusts in air.







Abstract
Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate.

     alt="Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid-Based Lewis Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An atom efficient method of producing diborane from borohydride sources has been provided. Ionic liquids provide a controlled source of boron trifluoride which acts as a Lewis acid to release diborane. The EMIM generated from the ionic liquid also burns effectively in air making a highly efficient fuel source which combusts in air.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3D printed propellant formulation was also tested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aromative Dephosphinidenation of a Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene toward E&#8722;H (E=H, Si, N and P) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a bulky amino substituent at phosphorous enables the development of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene. This compound serves as an efficient phosphinidene synthon, thermally releasing transient phosphinidenes shown to activate dihydrogen (H2), E&#8722;H (E=Si, N and P) bonds and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (5) was prepared by treatment of a sterically encumbered amino phosphorus dichloride (3) with MgA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 (A=anthracene). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a pentacyclic framework consisting of 5 with two phosphirane rings fused to the anthracene in a trans&#8208;fashion. Compound 5 has been shown to be an efficient phosphinidene synthon, readily liberating two transient phosphinidene units for subsequent downstream bond activation via the reductive elimination of anthracene under mild conditions. The formal oxidative addition of H2 and E&#8722;H (E=Si, N, P) bonds by the liberated phosphinidene provided diphosphine and substituted phosphines. Furthermore, phosphinidene transfer to alkenes and alkynes smoothly yielded the corresponding phosphiranes and phosphirenes. The mechanism of the H2 activation by 5 was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Multiple Functional Bonds Integrated Interphases for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional bonds integrated strategy is proposed to regulate cathode electrolyte interphase by the trip&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). It endows the 3&#8197;Ah hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 pouch full cell with a capacity retention up to 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4&#8722; is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6&#8722; in PC&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+&#8208;FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+&#8208;PC and participation of SN and PF6&#8722; anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3&#8197;Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of SIBs.

         <title>Chemodivergent Parallel Kinetic Resolution of Paracyclophanes: Enantiomer Fishing with Different Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of catalytic strategy in asymmetric synthesis is disclosed, through which the parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) of the racemic substrate can be realized with two distinct achiral reactants. The current study also represents the seminal investigations on the PKR reaction of racemic compounds bearing planar chirality, the chemodivergent PKR reaction with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, and the catalytic approach for the preparation of chiral pyridines bearing multi&#8208;functionalities.







Abstract
An unprecedented chemodivergent strategy for parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) is disclosed through which two planar chiral products bearing different structures were simultaneously afforded with opposite stereoselectivities. Two achiral esters are activated by one single chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to react with the different enantiomers of the racemic imine substrate in a parallel fashion. Two products bearing distinct structures and opposite stereoselectivities are respectively afforded from the same reaction system in good to excellent yields, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Control experiments and kinetic studies are carried out to probe the kinetic and dynamic properties during the reaction progress. The planar chiral pyridine and lactam products show interesting applications in both asymmetric synthesis and pesticide development.

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SBnCln Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>

Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral closo&#8208;boranes of various sizes by co&#8208;pyrolyzing the simple electron&#8208;precise synthons S2Cl2 and B2Cl4 at 280&#8201;&#176;C, closo&#8208;SB5Cl5, closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 and closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction. MS spectra and computations evidenced the recurrent formation of further closo&#8208;SBnCln , with n=4, 6, 10, and also with 12 designed for the supra&#8208;icosahedral architecture.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass&#8208;spectrometry evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of closo&#8208;SBnCln with n=4, 6, 10, and supra&#8208;icosahedral 12.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2 Catalysts in Li&#8722;S Batteries by Anion&#8208;Cation Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion P and cation Mo co&#8208;doped MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) electrocatalyst was designed for durable Li&#8722;S batteries. Such P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 electrocatalyst combine strong anchoring for polysulfides with the uniquely selective bi&#8208;directional electrocatalytic activity for nucleation and dissociation of Li2S, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and achieving simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li2S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce the cyclability of Li&#8722;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion&#8208;cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li2S. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the pivotal role of dopants in fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;band center and optimizing the electronic structure of MnO2. Furthermore, this well&#8208;designed configuration processes catalytic selectivity. Specifically, P&#8208;doping expedites rapid Li2S nucleation kinetics by minimizing reaction&#8208;free energy, while Mo&#8208;doping facilitates robust Li2S dissolution kinetics by mitigating decomposition barriers. This dual&#8208;doping approach equips P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 with robust bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity, effectively overcoming passivation effect and suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. Consequently, Li&#8722;S batteries incorporating P,Mo&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based separators demonstrate favorable performance than pristine TMOs. This design offers rational viewpoint for the development of catalytic materials with superior bi&#8208;directional sulfur electrocatalytic in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Radical Isomerization Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Access C5, C6 or C7 Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical isomerization homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been successfully developed. Utilizing various monomers, the radical translocation pathway involving cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer occurs with remarkable efficiency and selectivity. These distinct propagation mechanisms enable C5, C6, or C7 polymerizations with precise control over monomer composition and main chain sequence.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated linear &#945;&#8208;olefins are valuable building blocks for organic transformation or olefin (co)polymerization, but they are recognized as textbook knowledge for non&#8208;homopolymerizable monomers under radical conditions. In this article, we disclose our effort to achieve an unprecedented library of all carbon&#8208;bonded sequence&#8208;regulated polymers via radical isomerization homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefin derivatives. The success of this distinctive polymerization is attributed to the remarkable efficiency and selectivity exhibited during the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer, which is greatly enhanced by the precise engineering of their monomer structures. This polymerization process enables the elongation of polymer chains by five, six, or seven carbon atoms at each propagation step. These polymers, obtained through the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer involved radical isomerization polymerization processes, emerge as promising candidates resembling polyethylene or polyacrylonitrile copolymers.

Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of CoN4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90&#8201;%/85&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8211;0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications. This strategy thus provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites, promoting high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2 and beyond.

         <title>Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;Based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic measurements, combined with operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ microscopy characterization provided new insights on the carbon formation pathway over Rhodium&#8208;based catalyst materials during methane dry reforming, which allowed to relate the reaction kinetics with changes in catalyst structure under true reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mechanism for carbon deposition and its impact on the reaction kinetics of Methane Dry Reforming (MDR) using Rhodium&#8208;based catalysts is presented. By integrating Raman spectroscopy with kinetic analysis in an operando&#8208;annular chemical reactor under strict chemical conditions, we discovered that carbon deposition on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst follows a nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism. The dynamics of carbon aggregates at the surface is found to be ruled by the CO2/CH4 ratio and the inlet CH4 concentration. The findings elucidate the spatiotemporal development of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their effects on catalytic performance. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for carbon formation shows that the influence of CO2 on MDR kinetics is an indirect result of carbon accumulation over time frames exceeding the turnover frequency, thus reconciling conflicting reports in the literature regarding CO2&#8242;s kinetic role in MDR.

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Phase Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;Situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem solid&#8208;solution phase post&#8208;synthetic modifications were realized based on porous molecular crystals. The sequential reactions involve addition reaction with hydrazine hydrate and condensation reaction with alkyl aldehydes, resulting in the production of three molecular frameworks in a quantitative manner, accompanied by solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow).







Abstract
Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution phase reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.

         <title>A Photocrosslinking Probe to Capture the Substrates of Caseinolytic Protease P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy using trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) and capture substrates within the barrel via a photocrosslinking moiety upon UV irradiation. The probes retain protease activity and capture numerous known and novel substrates of ClpP, allowing the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.







Abstract
Protein homeostasis in bacteria is regulated by proteases such as the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). Although substrates of ClpP have been successfully deciphered in genetically engineered cells, methods which directly trap processed proteins within native cells remain elusive. Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy which utilizes trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of ClpP and capture adjacent substrates with an attached photocrosslinking moiety. After enrichment using an alkyne handle, substrate deconvolution by mass spectrometry (MS) is performed. We show that our two traps bind substoichiometrically to ClpP, retain protease activity, exhibit unprecedented selectivity for Staphylococcus aureus ClpP in living cells and capture numerous known and novel substrates. The exemplary validation of trapped hits using a targeted proteomics approach confirmed the fidelity of this technology. In conclusion, we provide a novel chemical platform suited for the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.

         <title>Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/Non&#8208;Natural Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To explore the combinatorial space of peptidomimetics with a broad selection of building blocks, not limited to the 20&#8197;natural amino acids, we have developed a chemical evolution process. Ancestral molecules can be generated by screening an initial library with representative building blocks. Unbiased random mutagenesis in natural evolution was replaced by the chemoinformatics&#8208;based design of iteration cycles. We can generate tens of thousands of mutations and explore an expansive combinatory space exceeding 1017, allowing the discovery of high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;generations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;natural building blocks (BBs) present a vast reservoir of chemical diversity for molecular recognition and drug discovery. However, leveraging evolutionary principles to efficiently generate bioactive molecules with a larger number of diverse BBs poses challenges within current laboratory evolution systems. Here, we introduce programmable chemical evolution (PCEvo) by integrating chemoinformatic classification and high&#8208;throughput array synthesis/screening. PCEvo initiates evolution by constructing a diversely combinatorial library to create ancestral molecules, streamlines the molecular evolution process and identifies high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;cycles. By employing PCEvo with 108 BBs and exploring &gt;1017 chemical space, we identify bicyclic peptidomimetic binders against targets SAR&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and Claudin18.2, achieving nanomolar affinity. Remarkably, Claudin18.2 binders selectively stain gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines and patient samples. PCEvo achieves expedited evolution in a few rounds, marking a significant advance in utilizing non&#8208;natural building blocks for rapid chemical evolution applicable to targets with or without prior structural information and ligand preference.

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient method for the C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines was developed using readily available sulfinates and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This photoinduced radical approach enables the difunctionalization of alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane, providing access to a wide variety of fluoroalkylated pyridines.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, challenges are often faced with conventional Minisci reactions in achieving precise regioselectivity owing to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Reversible Local Protonation&#8208;Deprotonation: Tuning Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Zinc Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnX4 and monoprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnX4 (X=Cl, Br) were constructed from a single chiral organic cation. The reversible structural transformation induced by polar solvents and HBr/heat engenders chiroptical switching behaviors. The structural design strategy developed in this work elucidates the structure&#8208;property mechanism underlying the structural transitions and the distortion&#8208;related chirality transfer.







Abstract
Precise control over the organic composition is crucial for tailoring the distinctive structures and properties of hybrid metal halides. However, this approach is seldom utilized to develop materials that exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of enantiomeric hybrid zinc bromides: biprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H16N2)ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnBr4) and monoprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H15N2)2ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnBr4), derived from the chiral organic amine (R/S)&#8208;2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine ((R/S)&#8208;C12H14N2). These compounds showcase luminescent properties; the zero&#8208;dimensional biprotonated form emits green light at 505&#8197;nm, while the monoprotonated form, with a pseudo&#8208;layered structure, displays red luminescence at 599 and 649&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the reversible local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior of the organic cations allows for exposure to polar solvents and heating to induce reversible structural and luminescent transformations between the two forms. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower energy barrier associated with the deprotonation process within the pyrrole ring is responsible for the local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior observed. These enantiomorphic hybrid zinc bromides also exhibit switchable circular dichroism (CD) and CPL properties. Furthermore, their chloride counterparts were successfully obtained by adjusting the halogen ions. Importantly, the unique stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL characteristics position these hybrid zinc halides as promising candidates for applications in information storage, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs). The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism, which transforms a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.







Abstract
Thorium, a predominant actinide in the Earth's crust, presents significant environmental and health risks due to its radioactive nature. These risks are particularly pronounced during the mining and processing of monazite for rare earth elements (REEs), which contain substantial thorium concentrations. Current instrumental analysis methods for thorium, offer high accuracy but require laborious sample preparations and expensive instruments, making them unsuitable for on&#8208;site analysis. Herein, we present a class of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as fluorochromic sensors for Th4+ cations. Utilizing a heterobimetallic Eu3+/Tb3+ doping strategy, the luminescence colors of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH can be finely tuned from red, to orange, and to green. More intriguingly, the higher Lewis acidity of Th4+ facilitates the transformation of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH into a UiO&#8208;type Th&#8208;MOF via a dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism. This process results in a gradual reduction of characteristic Ln3+ emissions and the emergence of blue color ligand&#8208;based fluorescence, thereby leading to selective fluorochromic responses with increasing Th4+ concentrations and enabling visible detection of Th4+ cations. Additionally, a custom&#8208;built portable optoelectronic device is fabricated, which directly converts luminescence colors into red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) values. This device enables easy quantification of Th4+ concentrations without the need for complex instrumentation.

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

         <title>Phosphonium Iodide Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Highly Efficient X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of phosphonium iodide featuring blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence was reported. Benefitting from the efficient exciton utilization, near&#8208;unity PLQY, large Stokes shift, and high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability contributed by I&#8722;, the prepared phosphonium iodide delivers outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, providing the application potential in high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Organic scintillators are praised for their abundant element reserves, facile preparation procedures, and rich structures. However, the weak X&#8208;ray attenuation ability and low exciton utilization efficiency result in unsatisfactory scintillation performance. Herein, a new family of highly efficient organic phosphonium halide salts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are designed by innovatively adopting quaternary phosphonium as the electron acceptor, while dimethylamine group and halide anions (I&#8722;) serve as the electron donor. The prepared butyl(2&#8208;[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]phenyl)diphenylphosphonium iodide (C4&#8208;I) exhibits bright blue emission and an ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100&#8201;%. Efficient charge transfer is realized through the unique n&#8208;&#960; and anion&#8208;&#960; stacking in solid&#8208;state C4&#8208;I. Photophysical studies of C4&#8208;I suggest that the incorporation of I accounts for high intersystem crossing rate (kISC) and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), suppressing the intrinsic prompt fluorescence and enabling near&#8208;pure TADF emission at room temperature. Benefitting from the large Stokes shift, high PLQY, efficient exciton utilization, and remarkable X&#8208;ray attenuation ability endowed by I, C4&#8208;I delivers an outstanding light yield of 80721 photons/MeV and a low limit of detection (LoD) of 22.79&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1.

     alt="Phosphonium Iodide Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Highly Efficient X-Ray Scintillator"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new family of phosphonium iodide featuring blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence was reported. Benefitting from the efficient exciton utilization, near-unity PLQY, large Stokes shift, and high X-ray attenuation ability contributed by I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the prepared phosphonium iodide delivers outstanding X-ray scintillation performance, providing the application potential in high-quality X-ray imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic scintillators are praised for their abundant element reserves, facile preparation procedures, and rich structures. However, the weak X-ray attenuation ability and low exciton utilization efficiency result in unsatisfactory scintillation performance. Herein, a new family of highly efficient organic phosphonium halide salts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are designed by innovatively adopting quaternary phosphonium as the electron acceptor, while dimethylamine group and halide anions (I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) serve as the electron donor. The prepared butyl(2-[2-(dimethylamino)phenyl]phenyl)diphenylphosphonium iodide (C4-I) exhibits bright blue emission and an ultra-high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100&#8201;%. Efficient charge transfer is realized through the unique n-&#960; and anion-&#960; stacking in solid-state C4-I. Photophysical studies of C4-I suggest that the incorporation of I accounts for high intersystem crossing rate (k&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt;) and reverse intersystem crossing rate (k&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;), suppressing the intrinsic prompt fluorescence and enabling near-pure TADF emission at room temperature. Benefitting from the large Stokes shift, high PLQY, efficient exciton utilization, and remarkable X-ray attenuation ability endowed by I, C4-I delivers an outstanding light yield of 80721 photons/MeV and a low limit of detection (LoD) of 22.79&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work would provide a rational design concept and open up an appealing road for developing efficient organic scintillators with tunable emission, strong X-ray attenuation ability, and excellent scintillator performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale autonomous oscillatory motion was achieved upon the reduction of a perylenediimide disk at the solid&#8208;water interface. This redox&#8208;activated, self&#8208;propelled system can be modulated through variations in chemical structure and molecular alignment, offering a unique avenue for the construction of molecularly designed active matter.







Abstract
The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8208;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water&#8208;soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of the imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Focus Workflow for Simultaneously Engineering High Activity and Thermal Stability in Methyl Parathion Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;focus computationally guided iterative mutagenesis workflow was developed to simultaneously improve stability and activity in methyl parathion hydrolase. Thus, this study details a strategic innovation to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in protein engineering and can guide future efforts to design stable, highly active enzymes with defined structure&#8208;function relationships.







Abstract
Industrial fermentation applications typically require enzymes that exhibit high stability and activity at high temperatures. However, efforts to simultaneously improve these properties are usually limited by a trade&#8208;off between stability and activity. This report describes a computational strategy to enhance both activity and thermal stability of the mesophilic organophosphate&#8208;degrading enzyme, methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). To predict hotspot mutation sites, we assembled a library of features associated with the target properties for each residue and then prioritized candidate sites by hierarchical clustering. Subsequent in silico screening with multiple algorithms to simulate selective pressures yielded a subset of 23&#8197;candidate mutations. Iterative parallel screening of mutations that improved thermal stability and activity yielded, MPHase&#8208;m5b, which exhibited 13.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm and 4.2&#8197;times higher catalytic activity than wild&#8208;type (WT) MPH over a wide temperature range. Systematic analysis of crystal structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations revealed a wider entrance to the active site that increased substrate access with an extensive network of interactions outside the active site that reinforced &#945;&#946;/&#946;&#945; sandwich architecture to improve thermal stability. This study thus provides an advanced, rational design framework to improve efficiency in engineering highly active, thermostable biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <dc:description>
We explored the Polymer&#8208;Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal&#8208;free sodium&#8208;doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na+ and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H2 exposure. This FLP&#8208;inspired approach promises advances in main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH3) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8722;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&#8722;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.







Abstract
Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1.

     alt="In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon-6 Precursor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon-6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5&#8201;%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high-performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam from 4.0&#8197;g of lignin raw material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spoked wheels containing fluorene spokes were successfully prepared and characterized by various methods, including scanning tunneling microscopy. Their synthetic accessibility was correlated with quantum chemical calculations using geometric and energetic criteria, the former extracted from the theoretically proposed mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling, the latter from experimental cyclophane synthesis.







Abstract
A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes, and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling lead to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.

         <title>Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework possesses synergistic C2H2 binding sites on its pore surface, firstly realizing one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2 mixture.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C2H6 and C2H2. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture because of the low C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C2H6 and C2H2 preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF&#8208;TDCPB can not only obtain high&#8208;purity C2H4 from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture, with the C2H4 productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF&#8208;TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high&#8208;humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C2H2, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Cu&#8208;Doped NiCo Alloy Supported on Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu doped NiCo alloy supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) is synthesized. Because Cu doping facilitates the coupling of reaction intermediates with surface adsorbed oxygen, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and formate Faraday efficiency. Besides, a coupled system of glycerol oxidation with nitrate reduction is constructed, which further enhances the activity, reduces energy consumption and gains valuable ammonia simultaneously.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol which is regarded as a main byproduct of industrial biodiesel production, is an innovative strategy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals, but currently showcases slow kinetics, limited Faraday efficiency, and unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency electrooxidation of glycerol into formate via a Cu doped NiCo alloy catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) in a coupled system paired with nitrate reduction. The designed Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF delivers only 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record Faraday efficiency of formate of 93.8&#8201;%. The superior performance is ascribed to the rapid generation of NiIII&#8722;OOH and CoIII&#8722;OOH species and favorable coupling of surface *O with reactive intermediates. Using Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF as a bifunctional catalyst, the coupled system synchronously produces NH3 and formate, showing 290&#8197;mV lower than the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction, together with excellent long&#8208;term stability for up to 144&#8197;h.

     alt="Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Cu-Doped NiCo Alloy Supported on Nickel Foam"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cu doped NiCo alloy supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) is synthesized. Because Cu doping facilitates the coupling of reaction intermediates with surface adsorbed oxygen, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and formate Faraday efficiency. Besides, a coupled system of glycerol oxidation with nitrate reduction is constructed, which further enhances the activity, reduces energy consumption and gains valuable ammonia simultaneously.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrooxidation of biomass-derived glycerol which is regarded as a main byproduct of industrial biodiesel production, is an innovative strategy to produce value-added chemicals, but currently showcases slow kinetics, limited Faraday efficiency, and unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, we report high-efficiency electrooxidation of glycerol into formate via a Cu doped NiCo alloy catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) in a coupled system paired with nitrate reduction. The designed Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF delivers only 1.23&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a record Faraday efficiency of formate of 93.8&#8201;%. The superior performance is ascribed to the rapid generation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OOH and Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OOH species and favorable coupling of surface *O with reactive intermediates. Using Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF as a bifunctional catalyst, the coupled system synchronously produces NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and formate, showing 290&#8197;mV lower than the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction, together with excellent long-term stability for up to 144&#8197;h. This work lays out new guidelines and reliable strategies from catalyst design to system coupling for biomass-derived electrochemical refinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;site bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction. The crucial role of hybrid dual sites is determined and assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water. A record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at 18&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution and a low voltage for overall water splitting was achieved on these heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8722;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in situ formed Fe&#8722;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at current density of 18.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative B&#8592;N bonds simultaneously integrate solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect and visible light reactivity into a crystalline supramolecular host. Alkenes organized by B&#8592;N bonds enable rapid guest release within the host upon visible light exposure in air through [2+2] photocycloaddition. Benefiting from the reversible structural transformation between B&#8592;N host and adduct cocrystal, a customized capture and release of guests is realized.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447&#8197;nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented organocatalytic asymmetric entry to a range of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer catalysis was developed. The utilization of this protocol enables the remote desymmetric functionalization of prochiral cages with high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, diverse late&#8208;stage molecular editing of chiral prism&#8208;like cages was primed for an array of high&#8208;value chiral compounds.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

Finally, electrochemical studies established that &lt;b&gt;SWCNT-P&lt;/b&gt; is sensitive to the presence of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; wherein the Gutmann-Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus-enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P(O) functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Anchoring of Fe(III) Molecular Redox Catalysts into Graphitic Surfaces Via CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile model has been developed for supramolecular anchoring including CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, between iron porphyrin catalysts and graphitic surfaces, enabling a high&#8208;performance molecular electrode for aqueous CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical devices require solid anodes and cathodes for the easy assembling of the whole cell and thus redox catalysts need to be deposited on the electrodes. Typical catalyst deposition involves drop casting, spin coating, doctor blading or related techniques to generate modified electrodes where the active catalyst in contact with the electrolyte is only a very small fraction of the deposited mass. We have developed a methodology where the redox catalyst is deposited at the electrode based on supramolecular interactions, namely CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; between the catalyst and the surface. This generates a very well&#8208;defined catalysts&#8208;surface structure and electroactivity, together with a very large catalytic response. This approach represents a new anchoring strategy that can be applied to catalytic redox reactions in heterogeneous phase and compared to traditional methods involves about 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude less mass deposition to achieve comparable activity and with very well&#8208;behaved electroactivity and stability.

         <title>Regulating Atomically&#8208;Precise Pt Sites for Boosting Light&#8208;Driven Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic structure of Pt single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitates robust electronic interactions with the substrate, providing an optimal spatial and electronic framework for activating and converting CO2&#8722;CH4 molecules. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, highlighting the critical role of atomically&#8208;precise interface adjustment in multi&#8208;molecule systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane is a promising and mild route to convert two greenhouse gas into valuable syngas. However, developing facile strategy to atomically&#8208;precise regulate the active sites and realize balanced and stable syngas production is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spatial confinement approach to precisely control over platinum species on TiO2 surfaces, from single atoms to nanoclusters. The configuration comprising single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters engenders pronounced electronic metal&#8208;support interactions, with resultant interfacial states prompting surface charge rearrangement. The unique geometric and electronic properties of these atom&#8208;cluster assemblies facilitate effective activation of CH4 and CO2, accelerating intermediate coupling and minimizing side reactions. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, displaying high apparent quantum yield of 9.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and turnover frequency of 1289&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work provides insightful understanding for exploring more multi&#8208;molecule systems at an atomic scale.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis of zinc cyclopropoxide enables a stereoselective hydroxyallylation of cyclopropenes with enolized homoenolate as a transient prochiral nucleophile, thus affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. An enantioselective variant has also been achieved using a chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC.







Abstract
A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Decorated Rhodium Nanoparticles Incorporated in Covalent Organic Framework for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny Rh nanoparticles (NPs) are encapsulated in a covalent organic framework and then decorated with chiral diene ligands to create chiral microenvironment for asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. The results demonstrate that decorating the Rh NPs with ligands initiates activity, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the ligand and the substrate are crucial for achieving high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
While metal nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated their great potential in catalysis, introducing chiral microenvironment around metal NPs to achieve efficient conversion and high enantioselectivity remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this work, tiny Rh NPs, modified by chiral diene ligands (Lx) bearing diverse functional groups, are incorporated into a covalent organic framework (COF) for the asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. Though Rh NPs hosted in the COF are inactive, decorating Rh NPs with Lx creates the active Rh&#8722;Lx interface and induces high activity. Moreover, chiral microenvironment modulation around Rh NPs by altering the groups on chiral diene ligands greatly optimizes the enantioselectivity (up to 95.6&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic investigations indicate that the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between Lx and nitroalkenes plays critical roles in the resulting enantioselectivity. This work highlights the significance of chiral microenvironment modulation around metal NPs by chiral ligand decoration for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis.

A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into crystalline microrods by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. CH2Cl2&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered domino transformation or patterned&#8208;mask&#8208;assisted vapor treatment transforms these microrods into multiblock polarized photonic heterojunctions with alternate yellow/red phosphorescence and orthogonal polarization directions, as a result of the vaporchromic switching of crystal packing and excited&#8208;state properties.







Abstract
Photonic heterostructures with codable properties have shown great values as versatile information carriers at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. These heterostructures are typically prepared by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step growth or post&#8208;functionalization method to achieve varied emission colors with different building blocks. In order to realize high&#8208;throughput and multivariate information loading, we report here a strategy to integrate polarization signals into photonic heterojunctions. A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into highly polarized yellow&#8208;phosphorescent crystalline microrods (Y&#8208;rod) by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. Upon end&#8208;initiated desorption of the incorporated CH2Cl2 solvents, the Y&#8208;rod is transformed in a domino fashion into tri&#8208;block polarized photonic heterojunctions (PPHs) with alternate red&#8208;yellow&#8208;red emissions or red&#8208;phosphorescent microrods (R&#8208;rods). The red emissions of these structures are also highly polarized; however, their polarization directions are just orthogonal to those of the yellow phosphorescence of the Y&#8208;rod. With the aid of a patterned mask, the R&#8208;rod can be further programmed into multi&#8208;block PPHs with precisely controlled block sizes by side&#8208;allowed adsorption of CH2Cl2 vapor. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that the solvent&#8208;regulated modulation of the crystal packing and excited&#8208;state property is critical for the construction of these PPHs.

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;Capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel dissymmetric quinoidal molecules end&#8208;capped by dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium were reported and their formation mechanism was proposed. The respective zwitterionic forms make contributions to their ground state structures. Of particular note is the observation that their emissions can be switched on by increasing the solution viscosity, by dispersing them in polymer matrix, or upon binding with certain proteins.







Abstract
A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant fluorescence improvement and considerable piezochromism are firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Pressure&#8208;induced photocurrent enhancement is also observed, because of the promoted electron orbitals coupling resulting from the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1&#8197;atm to 2.5&#8197;GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8722;I&#8722;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Brings High Electron Delocalization for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural systems optimize charge carrier behavior via molecular spatial arrangement, a phenomenon largely unexplored in artificial systems. PFC&#8208;1, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with controllable &#960;&#8208;stacking, offers valuable insights into this process. Varying &#960;&#8208;stacking perpendicular to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in HOFs alters electron density, redox potential, and charge carrier transport and separation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance.







Abstract
Unlike many studies that regulate transport and separation behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers through controlling the chemical composite, our work demonstrates this goal can be achieved through simply tuning the molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) without altering the building blocks or network topology. Further investigations reveal that the long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking significantly promotes electron delocalization and enhances electron density, thereby effectively suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination and augmenting the charge transfer rate. Simultaneously, acting as a porous substrate, it boosts electron density of Pd nanoparticle loaded on its surfaces, resulting in remarkable CO2 photoreduction catalytic activity (CO generation rate: 48.1&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h) without the need for hole scavengers. Our study provide insight into regulating the charge carrier behaviours in molecular assemblies based on hydrogen bonds, offering a new clue for efficient photocatalyst design.

         <title>Steering the Site Distance of Atomic Cu&#8722;Cu Pairs by First&#8208;Shell Halogen Coordination Boosts CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic Cu&#8722;Cu pairs with a controllable site distance by first&#8208;shell halogen coordination was reported in this work, which shows an enhanced CO2RR performance of C2 products. In addition, a linear scaling relationship that that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites is accelerated to C2H4 generation, while short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites is beneficial for C2H5OH formation was revealed to give a wide comprehension towards site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8722;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The atomic Cu&#8722;Cu pairs with a controllable site distance by first-shell halogen coordination was reported in this work, which shows an enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. In addition, a linear scaling relationship that that long-range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites is accelerated to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; generation, while short-range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites is beneficial for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH formation was revealed to give a wide comprehension towards site-distance-dependent catalytic performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8722;C coupling to unravel their structure-performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first-shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long-range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products, up to 74.1&#8201;%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long-range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites are accelerated to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; generation and short-range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites are beneficial for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH formation are disclosed.

         <title>Boosting Organic Solar Cells to Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency through Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Fluorinated Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, NFREA 412&#8208;6F with halogen atoms exhibit exceptional crystallinity and improved charge transport. The D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend in OSCs shows enhanced efficiency over 18&#8201;%. 412&#8208;6F&#8242;s lower MOC compared to Y6 underscores its cost&#8208;effectiveness. This innovative approach in non&#8208;covalent forces yields a high&#8208;performance electron acceptor for superior photovoltaic outcomes.







Abstract
This study successfully designed and synthesized two nonfused ring electron acceptors, 412&#8208;6F and 412&#8208;6Cl, modified with fluorine and chlorine substituents, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that 412&#8208;6F possesses a planar molecular backbone and exhibits pronounced dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between the fluorine atoms on the lateral phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen atoms on the end groups. This specific interaction promotes dense end&#8208;group stacking, leading to a reduced interlayer spacing. Improved crystallinity and coherence length are observed in the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend film. Conversely, 412&#8208;6Cl adopts a more distorted configuration and lacks these interactions. As a result, the organic solar cell (OSC) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, surpassing the performance of the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6Cl OSC. This underscores the importance of designing novel acceptors with beneficial intermolecular interactions to enhance OSC efficiency, thus providing a new direction for organic photovoltaic advancement.

         <title>Surficial Homogenic Effect Enables Highly Stable Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we innovatively proposed a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition technique to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer and perovskite surface by introducing the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T). Ultimately, we successfully fabricated efficient deep&#8208;blue device delivering the stable emission at 460&#8197;nm with enhanced EQE of 5.01&#8201;% with superior half&#8208;time of 31.3&#8197;min.







Abstract
The device performance of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep&#8208;blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition method to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs delivered an EQE exceeding 5&#8201;% (@ 460&#8197;nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.

         <title>Tetrapodal Hole&#8208;Collecting Monolayer Materials Based on Saddle&#8208;Like Cyclooctatetraene Core for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrapodal hole&#8208;collecting monolayer materials based on a saddle&#8208;like cyclooctatetraene core were developed. These molecules were found to form monolayers on transparent electrode substrates, with some phosphonic acid anchoring groups pointing upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. The perovskite solar cell devices using these hole&#8208;collecting monolayers exhibit high power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and good operational stability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI&#8208;C3 and 4PATTI&#8208;C4, by employing a saddle&#8208;like indole&#8208;fused cyclooctatetraene as a &#960;&#8208;core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI&#8208;C4 as the hole&#8208;collecting monolayer, 4PATTI&#8208;C3&#8208;based devices exhibit a faster hole&#8208;collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and 21.4&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;cell (0.1&#8197;cm2) and a mini&#8208;module (1.62&#8197;cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability. This work represents how structural modification of multipodal molecules could substantially modulate the functions of the hole&#8208;collecting monolayers after being adsorbed onto TCO substrates.

         <title>Precisely Regulating Asymmetric Charge Distribution by Single&#8208;Atom Central Doped Ag&#8208;Based Series Clusters for Enhanced Photoreduction of CO2 to Alcohol Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom central doped Ag&#8208;based series clusters (M1Ag24, M=Ag, Au, Pt) were introduced to precisely regulate the charge density of FePPc, in which Pt1Ag24 caused the most asymmetric charge distribution of Fe sites (followed by Au1Ag24 and Ag25), leading to the favorable CO2 adsorption and activation and showing enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with the methanol/ethanol yield of 48.55/32.97&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in H2O&#8208;CO2 system.







Abstract
High efficiently photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) into liquid fuels in pure water system remains challenged. Iron polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) with strong light harvesting, unique Fe&#8208;N4 structure, abundant pores, and good stability could serve as a promising catalyst for CO2 photoreduction. To further improve the catalytic efficiency, herein, symmetry&#8208;breaking Fe sites are constructed by coupling with atomically precise M1Ag24 (M=Ag, Au, Pt) series clusters. Especially, the introduction of Pt1Ag24 causes the most asymmetric charge distribution of Fe in FePPc (followed by Au1Ag24 and Ag25), leading to the favorable CO2 adsorption and activation. In addition, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc exhibits the most effective photogenerated carriers transfer and separation. As a result, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc shows the methanol/ethanol yield of 48.55/32.97&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in H2O&#8208;CO2 system under visible light irradiation, ~1.65/1.25&#8208;fold, 1.83/1.37&#8208;fold, and 3.60/1.61&#8208;fold higher than that of Au1Ag24&#8208;FePPc, Ag25&#8208;FePPc, and FePPc, respectively. This work provides a concept for precisely construction and regulation symmetry&#8208;breaking sites of cluster&#8208;based catalysts for effective CO2 conversion.

         <title>Precisely Constructing Molecular Junctions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic CO2 Reduction</title>

A porphyrin&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized using a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy to introduce CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation sites into the framework. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport, which achieves an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%).







Abstract
The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction&#8208;type porphyrin&#8208;based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP) was successfully self&#8208;assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single&#8208;component photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure&#8208;function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.

         <title>Dual Redox&#8208;active Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;based Memristors for Highly&#8208;efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method to synthesize highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks containing dual redox&#8208;active units. The synergistic effect of these units significantly reduces the redox energy barrier and improves the efficiency of neuromorphic computation.







Abstract
Organic memristors based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant potential for future neuromorphic computing applications. The preparation of high&#8208;quality COF nanosheets through appropriate structural design and building block selection is critical for the enhancement of memristor performance. In this study, a novel room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method was used to synthesize Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF, which contains two redox&#8208;active units: trinuclear copper and triphenylamine. The resultant COF nanosheets were dispersed through acid&#8208;assisted exfoliation and subsequently spin&#8208;coated to fabricate a high&#8208;quality COF film on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The synergistic effect of the dual redox&#8208;active centers in the COF film, combined with its distinct crystallinity, significantly reduces the redox energy barrier, enabling the efficient modulation of 128 non&#8208;volatile conductive states in the Al/Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF/ITO memristor. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on these 128 conductance states, image recognition for ten representative campus landmarks was successfully executed, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.13&#8201;% after 25 training epochs. Compared to devices based on binary conductance states, the memristor with 128 conductance states exhibits a 45.56&#8201;% improvement in recognition accuracy and significantly enhances the efficiency of neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Size Control and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Heteroleptic Pd3A3B3 and Pd4A4B4 Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;statistical multicomponent assembly gives simple synthetic access to the first Pd3A3B3 bowls, capable of showing guest&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Adjustment of ligand angle or backbone functionality allows control over the ring size, yielding Pd4A4B4 bowls or saddle&#8208;type structures.







Abstract
Two new structural motifs within the class of heteroleptic PdnAnBn assemblies, namely syn&#8208;cis&#8208;Pd3A3B3 bowls and bowl&#8208; (syn) or saddle&#8208; (anti) shaped cis&#8208;Pd4A4B4 rings are introduced. All of the ten examples share a common longer fluorenone&#8208;based bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, equipped with meta&#8208;pyridine donor groups. The ring size (3&#8208; vs. 4&#8208;membered) and conformational preference (bowl vs. saddle) are controlled by the choice of the shorter ligand. These carry para&#8208;pyridine donors, different aromatic backbones (benzene, thiophene or selenophene) and either no or small or bulky endohedral substituents, serving to control the nuclearity of the heteroleptic rings through different effects (ligand angle, charge distribution or backbone bulk). Moreover, the luminescence of the fluorenone ligand is conserved in the formed architectures. Emission intensity as well as host&#8211;guest properties vary depending on the inward&#8208;pointing functions. All Pd3A3B3 assemblies are shown to bind chiral guest BINOL bis&#8208;sulfonate which imparts its chirality to the entire host&#8211;guest complex. This results in a guest&#8208;induced circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor glum up to 10&#8722;3.

All Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; assemblies are shown to bind chiral guest BINOL bis-sulfonate which imparts its chirality to the entire host&#8211;guest complex. This results in a guest-induced circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor &lt;i&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>

         <dc:description>
New phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetanes bearing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with different electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs were shown to have an accelerated chemiexcitation and increased stability compared to previously reported 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe containing a six&#8208;member sulfone unit exhibited increased detection sensitivity toward &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expressing bacteria in growth medium.







Abstract
The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth medium. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by high&#8208;entropy concept, an multicomponent (MC) electrical double layer (EDL) structure is constructed by the addition of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions into electrolytes. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between these additives, the Zn|Cu half cell achieves a high average CE of 99.5&#8201;% with a high Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibits a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.







Abstract
Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter &#8211; a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement &#8211; was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5&#8201;% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3&#8201;%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our innovative unimolecular multiple&#8208;activatable photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) ingeniously integrates specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2.&#8722;/GSH into a single molecular platform, thereby enabling the simultaneous monitoring of NE activity and oxidative stress with minimal cross&#8208;reactivity, by modulating the photoinduced electron transfer and conjugation effect, respectively.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques. UMAPP, comprising a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, facilitates NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer impacting photoacoustic intensity at 685&#8197;nm (PA685). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction of catechol groups by O2&#8901;&#8722; and GSH induce reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum (PA745/PA685 ratio). Initial UMAPP applications successfully distinguished atherosclerotic and healthy mice, evaluated pneumonia&#8216;s effect on plaque composition and verified the probe&#8216;s effectiveness in drug&#8208;treatment studies by detecting molecular alterations before visible histopathological changes. The integrated molecular imaging capabilities of UMAPP offer promising advancements in atherosclerosis diagnosis and management, enabling early and accurate identification of vulnerable plaques.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens (hetero&#8208;POINT) has been developed to rationalize the design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. Immunological investigations reveal that the pattern of heterotypic antigen distribution yields distinct humoral and mucosal immune effects, highlighting the significance of the spatial placement of the antigens in structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.

Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/Paramagnetic Cobalt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of local gradient magnetic field&#8208;assisted in situ reconstruction is developed to directionally modulate the reconstruction of CoBDC in ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell precatalyst. The Kelvin force induced by gradient magnetic field can increase the proportion of divalent Co in the derived CoOxHy, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity compared to the reconstructed sample without gradient magnetic field assistance.







Abstract
The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128&#8201;% at 1.63&#8197;V and an overpotential reduction by 28&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100&#8197;h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison between the recently reported organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes and previously published direct methods display that his transformation does not establish a novel concept, but simply an addition to the portfolio of known reactions. Addition of mediators to our established direct electrolysis protocol and direct conversion of reported scope examples serve further to strengthen this statement.







Abstract
The recently reported electrochemical, organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes, a reaction referred to as &#8220;electrochemical deuterium atom transfer&#8221;, differs mechanistically from reported direct electrochemical hydrogenations/deuterations only by a mediated, homogeneous SET to the substrates. By comparing direct vs. mediated processes in general and for styrene reduction, we display that Qiu's work does not change the concept of this chemistry. Experiments with mediators and the direct reduction of examples from the reported scope show that even electron&#8208;rich substrates can be reduced when our direct protocol, published six months before Qiu's work, is applied.

The dissolution&#8211;recrystallization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) opens exciting possibilities for fluorochromic detection of radionuclides. In their Research Article (e202410453), Jian Lin et al. introduce a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based MOFs. The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8211;recrystallization mechanism, transforming a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.

         <dc:description>
Applying evolution to create bioactive molecules beyond natural building blocks (BBs) is crucial for chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the application of evolution with many different non&#8208;natural BBs remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202409746), Yixin Zhang, Fazheng Ren, Weilin Lin et&#8197;al. developed a programmable chemical evolution approach using natural/non&#8208;natural BBs. It starts from creating ancestral molecules, followed by evolving high&#8208;affinity peptidomimetic binders in just a few generations within an astronomically large combinatorial space.

Spatiotemporal operando Raman spectroscopy, combined with kinetic analysis under controlled chemical conditions, was employed to investigate the formation of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their kinetic impact during methane dry reforming on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, as reported by Matteo Monai, Matteo Maestri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408668). In the cover image, an increased CO2 content (depicted by the hot air balloon) relative to methane (represented by the basket) inhibits methane from leading to coke formation, symbolized by the mountains (Cover design: Lia Tagliavini).

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Chemistry in Aqueous Ammonium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored molecular trap with optimal oxygen sites distribution is fabricated for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene isomers. Based on the specific molecular length recognition, simultaneous ultra&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) are achieved in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption.







Abstract
Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8211;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8722;C4H2O&#8722;CO2], featuring an effective pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.

         <title>From Cyclopropene to Housane Derivatives Via Intramolecular Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of housanes from cyclopropenes via highly strained intramolecular cyclopropanation is described. The reaction proceeds in synthetically useful yields and diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the application to the synthesis of unnatural housane&#8208;containing terpenoids is disclosed.







Abstract
The synthesis of housane derivatives from cyclopropenes is described. Under rhodium(II) catalysis, cyclopropenylvinyl carbinols can regioselectively generate a carbene intermediate which undergoes an intramolecular cyclopropanation to form a housane, a skeleton with similar ring strain as the cyclopropene precursor. The procedure shows a remarkable broad scope and efficiency. Moreover, the method served to prepare man&#8208;made housane&#8208;containing terpene derivatives, which are not accessible by Nature.

Two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium tellurides formulated as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)][(&#956;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#956;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] were reported. Both clusters possess low optical band gaps comparable to those of benchmark semiconductors and slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures. These co&#8208;existing properties qualify them as the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.







Abstract
Magnetic semiconductors, with integrated properties of ferromagnets and semiconductors, are significant for developing next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Herein two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium(III) tellurides, formulated respectively as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)2][(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 (Dy5Te6, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] (Dy6Te10), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single&#8208;molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral homopropargylic alcohols affords cyclopentenes with a quaternary chiral center. A chiral binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl phosphine ligand featuring a distal phosphoryl group enables gold&#8208;ligand cooperation in this highly enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cyclization chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety&#8212;an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the substrate HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of enoate and ketone precursors. In addition to monocyclic cyclopentenes, spirocyclic and bicyclic ones are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.

         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of pyrazine and allyl radicals led to the formation of a nanoscale decanuclear organometallic {Dy10} complex. This ring&#8208;like {Dy10} complex displays slow magnetic relaxation under a small applied field.







Abstract
Over the years, polynuclear cyclic or torus complexes have attracted increasing interest due to their unique metal topologies and properties. However, the isolation of polynuclear cyclic organometallic complexes is extremely challenging due to their inherent reactivity, which stems from the labile and reactive metal&#8208;carbon bonds. In this study, the pyrazine ligand undergoes a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction leading to the formation of a decanuclear [(Cp*)20Dy10(L1)10]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12(C7H8) (1; where L1 = anion of 2&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrazine; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complex, where all DyIII metal centres are bridged by the anionic L1 ligand. Amongst the family of polynuclear Ln organometallic complexes bearing CpR2Lnx units (CpR = substituted cyclopentadienyl), 1 features the highest nuclearity obtained to date. In&#8208;depth computational studies were conducted to elucidate the proposed reaction mechanism and formation of L1, while probing of the magnetic properties of 1, revealed slow magnetic relaxation upon application of a static dc field.

&lt;p&gt;The C&#8722;C cross-coupling reaction of pyrazine and allyl radicals led to the formation of a nanoscale decanuclear organometallic {Dy&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;} complex. This ring-like {Dy&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;} complex displays slow magnetic relaxation under a small applied field.

         <title>Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Single Crystals of A Three&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Covalent Framework Containing Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of a chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid three&#8208;dimensional covalent framework (named CityU&#8208;22) were prepared, which is a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. CityU&#8208;22 shows good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat. CityU&#8208;22 also exhibits an ultraviolet nonlinear optical behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4. CityU&#8208;22 is the first chiral organic&#8211;inorganic covalent framework with a high SHG response.







Abstract
Extending covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into crystalline carbon&#8208;free covalent backbones is an important strategy to endow these materials with more exotic functions. Integrating metal&#8208;free inorganic and organic components into one covalent framework is an effective way to address the issue of poor thermal/solvent stability in the field of nonlinear optics (NLO). However, constructing such structures is very challenging. Here, we linked 3&#8208;connected nods (BO3) and 2&#8208;connected organic building blocks (Te(Ph)2) together to produce colorless single crystals (size up to 400&#8197;&#956;m) of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral covalent framework (CityU&#8208;22). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that CityU&#8208;22 has a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. The chiral CityU&#8208;22 displays good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat (the decomposition temperature above 300&#8201;&#176;C). Due to its non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone (&#8722;Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O&#8722;), CityU&#8208;22 shows an ultraviolet NLO behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4 (KDP).

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of redox&#8208;active bipyridinium ligands into spin crossover active metal organic frameworks leads to void spaces reminiscent of the &#8216;little blue box&#8217;. The inclusion of a &#960;&#8208;electron rich aromatic guest molecule causes a single crystal to single crystal transformation and guest&#8208;induced spin transition. Therefore, this work inspires the spin state control of these systems through the application of (photo&#8208;)electrical stimuli.







Abstract
Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.

         <title>Biocatalytic Ether Lipid Synthesis by an Archaeal Glycerolprenylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Remarkably, it does so through carbocation&#8208;type chemistry in a fully solvent&#8208;exposed active site.







Abstract
Although ethers are common in secondary natural products, they are an underrepresented functional group in primary metabolism. As such, there are comparably few enzymes capable of constructing ether bonds in a general fashion. However, such enzymes are highly sought after for synthetic applications as they typically operate with higher regioselectivity and under milder conditions than traditional organochemical approaches. To expand the repertoire of well characterized ether synthases, we herein report on a promiscuous archaeal prenyltransferase from the scarcely researched family of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthases (GGGPSs or G3PSs). We show that the ultrastable Archaeoglobus fulgidus G3PS makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Based on experimental and computational data, we propose a mechanism for this enzyme which involves an intermediary prenyl carbocation equivalent. As such, this study provides the fundamental understanding and methods to introduce G3PSs into the biocatalytic alkylation toolbox.

         <title>Cascade Effect of a Dimerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dendrimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule with an improved horizontal emitting dipole orientation, fast reverse intersystem crossing, and high photoluminescence quantum yield in a pristine film was constructed. The solution&#8208;processable non&#8208;doped device and the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibited maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.6&#8201;% and 30.7&#8201;%, respectively, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with a high horizontal orientation are highly essential for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes; however, pivotal molecular design strategies to improve the horizontal orientation of solution&#8208;processable TADF emitters are still scarce and challenging. Herein, a phenyl bridge is adopted to connect the double TADF units, and generate a dimerized TADF dendrimer, D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF. Compared to its counterpart with a single TADF unit, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule not only exhibits an improved horizontal dipole ratio (78&#8201;%) due to the &#960;&#8208;delocalization&#8208;induced extended molecular conjugation, but also displays a faster reversed intersystem crossing rate constant (6.08&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95&#8201;% in neat film.

     alt="Cascade Effect of a Dimerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dendrimer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution-processable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule with an improved horizontal emitting dipole orientation, fast reverse intersystem crossing, and high photoluminescence quantum yield in a pristine film was constructed. The solution-processable non-doped device and the TADF-sensitized fluorescence device exhibited maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.6&#8201;% and 30.7&#8201;%, respectively, and alleviated efficiency roll-off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with a high horizontal orientation are highly essential for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of organic light-emitting diodes; however, pivotal molecular design strategies to improve the horizontal orientation of solution-processable TADF emitters are still scarce and challenging. Herein, a phenyl bridge is adopted to connect the double TADF units, and generate a dimerized TADF dendrimer, D4CzBNPh-SF. Compared to its counterpart with a single TADF unit, the proof-of-the-concept molecule not only exhibits an improved horizontal dipole ratio (78&#8201;%) due to the &#960;-delocalization-induced extended molecular conjugation, but also displays a faster reversed intersystem crossing rate constant (6.08&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95&#8201;% in neat film. Consequently, the non-doped solution-processed device with D4CzBNPh-SF as the emitter achieves an ultra-high maximum EQE of 32.6&#8201;%, which remains at 26.6&#8201;% under a luminance of 1000 cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, when using D4CzBNPh-SF as a sensitizer, the TADF-sensitized fluorescence device exhibits a high maximum EQE of 30.7&#8201;% at a luminance of 575&#8197;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a full width at half maximum of 36&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Ordering in A One&#8208;Dimensional Organic Copper Chloride Hybrid Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) organic metal halide hybrid, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6, has been synthesized and characterized for the first time, which exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. This work paves novel pathways for developing functional low&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids for spintronics.







Abstract
Low dimensional (LD) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as new generation functional materials with exceptional structural and property tunability. Despite the remarkable advances in the development of LD OMHHs, optical properties have been the major functionality extensively investigated for most of LD OMHHs developed to date, while other properties, such as magnetic and electronic properties, remain significantly under&#8208;explored. Here, we report for the first time the characterization of the magnetic and electronic properties of a 1D OMHH, organic&#8208;copper (II) chloride hybrid (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6. Owing to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu atoms through chloride bridges in 1D [Cu2Cl62&#8722;]&#8734; chains, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 is found to exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. The two&#8208;terminal (2T) electrical measurement on a (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 single crystal reveals its insulating nature. This work shows the potential of LD OMHHs as a highly tunable quantum material platform for spintronics.

         <title>Copper Intercalation Induces Amorphization of 2D Cu/WO3 for Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was achieved for a Cu intercalated, amorphous 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the magnetic enhancement of 2D Cu/WO3 is originated from oxygen lattice distortion induced by Cu intercalation, leading to the formation of bound magnetic polaron for ferromagnetism.







Abstract
Ferromagnetism in the two&#8208;dimensional limit has become an intriguing topic for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications. To induce ferromagnetism in 2D materials, intercalation has been proposed to be an effective strategy, which could introduce lattice distortion and unpaired spin into the material to modulate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. To strengthen the understanding of the magnetic origin of 2D material, Cu was introduced into a 2D WO3 through chemical intercalation in this work (2D Cu/WO3). In contrast to the diamagnetic nature of Cu and WO3, room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was characterized for 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical results attribute the ferromagnetism to the bound magnetic polaron in 2D Cu/WO3, which is consist of unpaired spins from W5+/W4+ with localized carriers from oxygen vacancies. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to introduce ferromagnetism into diamagnetic WO3, which could be applied for a wider scope of 2D materials.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Metastable Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes with Tunable Threading Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planetary centrifugal mixing was the key to the rapid and convenient synthesis of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs). The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction served as the end&#8208;capping reaction using glutathione (GSH) to prepare metastable PRs. The GSH stoppers prevent de&#8208;threading at room temperature, such that heating controls the de&#8208;threading rate, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyrotaxanes (CD&#8208;PRs) are gaining attention for their dynamic sliding rings along the polymer axis, enabling various applications in molecular shuttles, drug delivery, and durable polymers with slidable cross&#8208;links. However, the conventional synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs with tunable threading ratios is typically laborious, time&#8208;consuming, and complicated, which limits their scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we highlight the great potential of planetary centrifugal mixing, a process that significantly accelerates and simplifies the initial synthesis of polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs), followed by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction as an efficient end&#8208;capping reaction for the synthesis of PRs. Notably, PRs synthesized with glutathione (GSH) as the end&#8208;capping reagent are in a metastable state, where GSH act as a molecular bumper that significantly prevent de&#8208;threading of &#945;&#8208;CD rings at room temperature. Moreover, the rate of ring de&#8208;threading can be precisely controlled by heating, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range. The developed strategy is of great significance to the efficient synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs, thus marking a significant step towards their practical application in advanced functional materials and devices.

         <title>Integration of Perylene Diimide into a Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework based on perylene diimide (PDI&#8208;PDA) has been synthesized and characterized. Its photocatalytic efficiency in thioether oxidation to sulfoxide compounds was more than ten&#8208;fold higher than that of PDI&#8208;PH. The enhanced electron&#8208;induced O2 activation under visible light was due to improved charge separation and transfer.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs) have garnered considerable attention due to their immense potential in photocatalysis. However, manipulating the molecular packing within their aggregates and enhancing the efficiency of photogenerated carrier recombination remain significant challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the incorporation of a PDI unit into a covalent organic framework (COF), named PDI&#8208;PDA, by linking an ortho&#8208;substituted PDI with p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA) to control its intermolecular aggregation. The incorporation enables precise modulation of electron&#8208;transfer dynamics, leading to a ten&#8208;fold increase in the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide with PDI&#8208;PDA compared to the PDI molecular counterpart, with yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. Electron property studies and density functional theory calculations show that the PDI&#8208;PDA with its well&#8208;defined crystal structure, enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lowers the electron transition barrier. Moreover, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the PDI unit promotes the spatial separation of the valency band maximum and conduction band minimum of PDI&#8208;PDA, suppressing the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and improving the charge&#8208;separation efficiency to give high photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a brief but effective way for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of commonly used PDI&#8208;based dyes by integrating them into a framework skeleton.

&lt;p&gt;Perylene diimides (PDIs) have garnered considerable attention due to their immense potential in photocatalysis. However, manipulating the molecular packing within their aggregates and enhancing the efficiency of photogenerated carrier recombination remain significant challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the incorporation of a PDI unit into a covalent organic framework (COF), named PDI-PDA, by linking an ortho-substituted PDI with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamine (PDA) to control its intermolecular aggregation. The incorporation enables precise modulation of electron-transfer dynamics, leading to a ten-fold increase in the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide with PDI-PDA compared to the PDI molecular counterpart, with yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. Electron property studies and density functional theory calculations show that the PDI-PDA with its well-defined crystal structure, enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lowers the electron transition barrier. Moreover, the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the PDI unit promotes the spatial separation of the valency band maximum and conduction band minimum of PDI-PDA, suppressing the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improving the charge-separation efficiency to give high photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a brief but effective way for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of commonly used PDI-based dyes by integrating them into a framework skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization for Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy was utilized to rapidly prepare electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films at room temperature, which exhibited stable polymorphic electrochromic properties. Additionally, the electrochromic behavior of COFs films at negative potentials can be regulated by uranium, demonstrating the unique color tunability of COFs.







Abstract
A rapid in situ synthesis of electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (EC&#8208;COFs) was proposed by using green electrochemical interface polymerization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine (TPDA) and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde (DHBD). The synthetized TPDA&#8208;DHBD films exhibit stable polymorphic color variations under different applied potentials, which can be attributed to the redox state changes of bis(triphenylamine) and imine electroactive functional groups within the COFs skeleton. TPDA&#8208;DHBD represents markedly different electrochromisms from red to cyan due to the steric hindrance effect caused by the presence of UO22+, demonstrating the unique tunability of COFs materials. This work offers a new feasible idea for rapid EC&#8208;COFs synthesis and tunable EC&#8208;COFs realization.

         <title>Methoxide&#8208;Enabled Zirconium&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the zirconium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkenes is presented that allows the direct use of zirconocene dichloride as catalyst through mild activation with a methoxide additive. The reaction can be applied to terminal, internal, and conjugated alkenes. A catalytic zirconium walk ensures the selective formation of linear silane products. Based on additional experiments and calculations, a zirconium(IV) mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
A zirconocene dichloride&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation is reported that can be applied to non&#8208;activated and conjugated terminal and internal alkenes. It involves a catalytic Zr&#8208;walk process and leads to a selective conversion to the linear product. Lithium methoxide serves as mild catalyst activating agent, which significantly increases the applicability and operational simplicity in comparison to earlier zirconium(II)&#8208;based protocols. Supported by additional experiments and calculations, a mechanism via zirconium(IV) intermediates is proposed. Due to the benign nature and ready&#8208;availability of the zirconium catalyst, the reaction is an attractive alternative to established alkene hydrosilylation methods.

         <title>Thermotropic &#8220;Plumber's Nightmare&#8221;&#8212;A Tight Liquid Organic Double Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A most common cubic phase in lyotropic (surfactant&#8208;water) systems, the &#8220;plumber's nightmare&#8221; labyrinth, has never been found in thermotropic liquid crystals. Here the first example is reported. Intriguingly, removal of just a methyl branch from the fluorescent mesogen's six alkyls converts the double&#8208;network cubic into an array of counter&#8208;twisting helices.







Abstract
Gyroid, double diamond and the body&#8208;centred &#8220;Plumber's nightmare&#8221; are the three most common bicontinuous cubic phases in lyotropic liquid crystals and block copolymers. While the first two are also present in solvent&#8208;free thermotropics, the latter had never been found. Containing six&#8208;fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod&#8208;like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side&#8208;branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side&#8208;chains should be very short. The true Plumber's nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod&#8208;like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end&#8208;chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework&#8208;forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry&#8208;based explanation is given.

         <title>One Iron for Two Iron Sites in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward Simultaneous N2&#8722;H2 Activation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron site in a metal&#8211;organic framework skeleton was introduced as an activator for the two types of iron sites in Fe3O4. Integration of these three kinds of iron sites in one catalytic system exhibited a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; effect, which played the roles in nitrogen activation, hydrogen activation and products transfer simultaneously, and hydrogenation of nitrogen to ammonia was achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts play an important role in the ammonia industry. As one of the most abundant iron minerals, Fe3O4 containing FeII and FeIII sites is widely distributed in the earth's crust and even on exoplanets, theoretically giving it both economic and catalytic potentials in ammonia synthesis. However, in the absence of specific active co&#8208;catalyst and harsh conditions, Fe3O4 is impossible to achieve ammonia synthesis alone. Here, we designed to activate the relatively inert FeII and FeIII sites in Fe3O4 with a third FeIII site inlayed in a coordination framework (MIL&#8208;101(Fe)) to achieve the unpresented multi&#8208;site collaborative catalysis. In&#8208;depth mechanism study confirmed the roles of three different Fe sites in N2 activation, H2 activation, and product transfer, respectively. Efficient N2&#8722;H2 activation to NH3 on the Fe3O4&#8208;based catalytic system has been achieved at extremely mild conditions. Our research provides a theoretical basis and a new strategy for designing efficient non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based ammonia synthesis catalyst with minimized energy consumption.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation and hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, enabling highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactones as well as &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds through a CO&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) process.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation and hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, enabling highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams in good yields. The mild reaction conditions allow use of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes bearing a variety of functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds through a CO&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) process, in which a cationic acylcobalt(IV) complex is proposed as the key intermediate.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in a Photostable Ion&#8208;Paired Yb&#8722;Eu Heteronuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>

Upconversion emission of Eu3+ was achieved in a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] and the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified. In addition, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 of 420&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes have potential application in diverse fields and attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, the similar coordination reactivity of lanthanide ions has constrained the designability of target molecule with well&#8208;defined structure, and many attempts obtained statistical mixtures. Herein, an ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] (TpPy=tris[3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl]hydroborate, ND=3&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;4&#8208;olate) was designed and synthesized. Thanks to the radius difference between Eu3+ (1.07&#8197;&#197;) and Yb3+ (0.98&#8197;&#197;) ions, the hexadentate TpPy ligand was selected to coordinate with Eu3+ and the Yb3+ with a smaller radius was chelated by bidentate ND ligand. As a result, the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis. Upon the excitation of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm, the upconversion emission of Eu3+ was realized through a cooperative sensitization process. Furthermore, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 (the time to 95&#8201;% of the initial emission intensity) of 420&#8197;minutes. This work provides the first example of a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex upconversion system and may bring insights into rational design of lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Locking and Sulfur&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Constructing Deep&#8208;Red Organic Electroluminescent Emitter with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with remarkable narrowband emission has opened a new avenue for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, the lack of construction strategies for purely red MR&#8208;TADF materials significantly impedes their application in full&#8208;color high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we propose a unique and handy approach of spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking and sulfur&#8208;embedding strategy to modify the parent MR&#8208;TADF framework, resulting in a red MR&#8208;TADF emitter with high color purity. The reported MR&#8208;TADF molecule (namely, FSBN) demonstrates a pure red emission with an emission maximum of 621 nm in toluene solution. The OLED with FSBN as emitter exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), which exactly matches the red standard defined by the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC). Importantly, the single&#8208;host OLED achieves a high power efficiency (PE) of up to 50.1 lm W&#8722;1, suggesting the potential for the development of low power consumption red OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hypothesis on the Function of High&#8208;Valent Fe in NiFe (Hydr)oxide in the Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigated the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and identified the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) within alkaline media via in&#8208;situ techniques. Several high&#8208;valent Fe ions were found to remain considerably stable in the absence of potential in NiFe (hydr)oxide, even 96 hours after the OER. For Ni2+ hydroxide treated with 57Fe ions, where Fe sites are introduced onto the surface of Ni2+ hydroxide, no Fe4+ species were detected at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). The findings of this study suggested that the oxidation of bulk Fe ions, similar to Ni ions, to high valent forms, is charge accumulation without a direct role in OER; these results offered a novel perspective on manipulating Fe states to optimize OER efficacy. The prevailing hypothesis suggested that trace amounts of high&#8208;valent Fe ions, notably those on the surface, directly participate in OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Pentacoordinate Halogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar hypercoordinate motifs represent an intriguing frontier in chemistry, challenging traditional bonding norms. As electronegativity of the central atom increases, achieving planar hypercoordination becomes more difficult due to restricted delocalization, making the design of planar hypercoordinate halogens particularly puzzling. Here, we conduct an extensive computational survey of LinXn+1&#8211; (n = 4, 5, 6; X = F, Cl, Br, I) clusters, revealing a starlike D5h&#8208;symmetry global minimum in Li5X6&#8211; (X = F, Cl, Br) with a planar pentacoordinate halogen (ppX), where X&#8211; is located at the center of Li5X5 crown. The clusters are stabilized predominantly through electrostatic interactions between X&#8211; and Li5X5, complemented by weak covalent bonding from dative interaction. Due to the weak orbital overlap, ppX clusters exhibit localized diatropic ring currents around X and Li.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic Confinement&#8208;Induced Excited Charge Transfer in Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Promoting CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate an electrostatic confinement&#8208;induced charge transfer pathway in a supramolecular photocatalyst comprising of an ionic covalent organic framework (COF) and cationic metal complexes. The dynamic electrostatic interactions not only attract cations around the COF to accept photogenerated electrons, but also allows for a retention of homogeneous catalytic characters of complexes, making a subtle balance. Accordingly, the electrostatic confinement effect facilitates the forward electron transfer from a photoexcited COF to cationic Co complex, realizing a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Its catalytic efficiency is far superior to the supramolecular counterparts with Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions. This work presents an insight for enhancing charge transfer in supramolecular systems, and provides an effective approach for construction of highly efficient photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Crystals based Fast Single Ion Conductor for Long&#8208;cycling Solid Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have low ionic conductivity due to the sluggish dynamics of polymer segments. Thus, only short&#8208;range movement of cations is supported, leading to low ionic conductivity and Zn2+ transference (tZn2+). Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystals (ZMCs) have considerable potential for supporting long&#8208;distance Zn2+ transport; however, their efficiency in ZIBs has not been explored. The present study developed a ZMC consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and zinc bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Zn(TFSI)2), with a structural formula identified as Zn(TFSI)2SN3. The ZMC has ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels in the crystalline lattices for ion conduction, providing high ionic conductivities (6.02 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C and 3.26 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35 &#176;C) and a high tZn2+ (0.97). We demonstrated that a Zn&#8214;Zn symmetrical battery with ZMCs has long&#8208;term cycling stability (1200 h) and a dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping process, even at a high plating areal density of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;fabricated solid&#8208;state Zn battery exhibited excellent performance, including high discharge capacity (1.52 mAh cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;term cycling stability (83.6% capacity retention after 70000 cycles (7 months)), wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;30 to 50 &#176;C) and fast charging ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Photoinduced&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Probe with a Turn&#8208;ON Chemiluminescence Mode&#8208;of&#8208;Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PeT&#8208;based fluorescent probes were demonstrated to be powerful tools for detection and imaging, owing to their significant fluorescence enhancement in response to specific targets. While numerous examples of fluorescence&#8208;based PeT have been frequently reported, there is not even a single example of a PeT probe that operates via a chemiluminescence mode. Here we report the first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe that acts via a chemiluminescent operation mode. We designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel chemiluminescent probe, featuring a PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on mechanism. The probe consists of a phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane, linked to an azide unit that acts as a PeT quencher. Upon cycloaddition of a strained cycloalkyne with the azide, a triazole&#8208;dioxetane is formed, which undergoes relatively slow chemiexcitation, resulting in a measurement window with an exceptionally high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (over 5000&#8208;fold). The PeT&#8208;dioxetane probe could effectively detect and image two model proteins labeled with strained cycloalkyne units (Myc&#8208;DBCO and Max&#8208;DBCO) through either NHS or maleimide conjugations. Comparative analysis shows that our PeT&#8208;based chemiluminescent probe significantly outperforms a commercially available fluorescent analog. We anticipate that the insights gained from this study will facilitate the development of additional chemiluminescent probes utilizing various PeT&#8208;quenching pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting Lysosomal Thiols for Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number and stability of lysosomes (LYs) are different in cancer and healthy cells that makes them a possible target for cancer specific therapy. However, no LY&#8208;targeting drug is clinically approved yet. We describe in this paper a new therapeutic approach based on alkylation of lysosomal thiols in cancer cells by reversible thiol binder 11. The treatment with 11 increases the level of lysosomal reactive oxygen species leading to their destabilization, disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. These effects are not observed in healthy cells. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner (NK)/Ly&#8208;RB model, 11 exhibits the spectacular therapeutic effect: it extends the lifespan of the treated mice from 21 to 85 days and cures 40% of mice. The survived mice develop antibodies against tumor NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells. Their repeated challenge with the NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells results in 100% mice survival compared to 0% survival in the control group of na&#239;ve mice. Ex vivo data indicate that neutrophils in spleen of the cured animals are also involved in targeting cancer cells and produce neutrophil extracellular traps. In summary, 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil&#8217;s reaction against tumors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click&#8208;release chemistry is a cutting&#8208;edge tool for exploring&#160;and manipulating&#160; biomolecule functions&#160;in native biological systems. However, it is challenging to achieve the precise regulation or therapy of individual cells via click&#8208;release strategies driven by proximity and thermodynamics. Herein, we propose a novel photoclick&#8208;release approach based on a photo&#8208;induced cycloaddition between 4,4'&#8208;bis(N&#8208;arylsydnone) or&#160;C&#8208;bithienyl&#8208;diarylsydnone and 2&#8208;arylamino&#8208;naphthoquinone via irradiation with&#160;405 or 485 nm light. It&#160;constructs 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[f]indazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione (BIZON) as a pharmacophore while releases an arylamine for fluorescence turn&#8208;on probing. Both of the photoclick reagents were tailored by&#160;connecting to the triphenyl phosphonium&#160;delivery&#160;motif for enrichment in the mitochondria of live cells.&#160;This enables&#160;an intracellular photoclick and release under the control of 405 or 485 nm light. We then discovered that the in situ photo&#8208;generated BIZON is capable of photosensitizing upon 485 or 520 nm light to produce singlet oxygen inside the mitochondria under aerobic conditions. Therefore, we&#160;realized wash&#8208;free fluorescence tracking and subsequent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy at single&#8208;cell resolution by using global illumination, which provides a foundation for wavelength&#8208;gated single&#8208;cell theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenating Polyethylene Terephthalate into Degradable Polyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recycling and upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most widely used polyester plastic globally, has attracted growing attention concerning its disposal as non&#8208;degradable waste in the natural environment. Transforming end&#8208;of&#8208;life PET into (bio)degradable polyester offers a novel approach to managing its waste. In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt; 87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. Pronounced depolymerization would occur with deeper hydrogenation, which generates a blend of PET&#8208;PECHD and polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) with lower Mw, and finally a single&#8208;type polymer PECHD. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and (bio)degradability in acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil. This research highlights the potential for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale production of degradable polyester from real&#8208;life plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Suppression of Multilayer Ion Migration via Molecular Complexation Strategy toward High&#8208;Performance Regular Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The migration and diffusion of Li+, I&#8208; and Ag impedes the realization of long&#8208;term operationally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a multifunctional and universal molecular complexation strategy to simultaneously stabilize hole transport layer (HTL), perovskite layer and Ag electrode by the suppression of Li+, I&#8208; and Ag migration via directly incorporating bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl) oxalate (TCPO) into HTL. Meanwhile, TCPO co&#8208;doping results in enhanced hole mobility of HTL, advantageous energy band alignment and mitigated interfacial defects, thereby leading to facilitated hole extraction and minimized nonradiative recombination losses. TCPO&#8208;doped regular device achieves a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.68% (certified 25.59%). The unencapsulated TCPO doped devices maintain over 90% of their initial efficiencies after 730 h of continuous operation under one sun illumination, 2800 h of storage at 30% relative humidity, and 1200 h of exposure to 65 &#176;C, which represents one of the best stabilities reported for regular PSCs. This work provides a new approach to enhance the PCE and long&#8208;term stability of PSCs by host&#8208;guest complexation strategy via rational design of multifunctional ligand molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvation via Ion Dipole Interactions for Low&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extending the stability of ether solvents is pivotal for developing low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium batteries. Herein, we elucidate the oxidation behavior of tetrahydrofuran with ternary BF4&#8208;, PF6&#8208; and di&#64258;uoro(oxalato)borate anions and the evolution of interfacial solvation environment. Combined in&#8208;situ analyses and computations illustrate that the ion dipole interactions and the subsequent formation of ether&#8208;Li+&#8208;anion complexes in electrolyte rearrange the oxidation order of solvated species, which enhances the electrochemical stability of ether solvent. Furthermore, preferential absorption of anions on the surface of high&#8208;voltage cathode favors the formation of a solvent&#8208;deficient electric double layer and an anti&#8208;oxidation cathode electrolyte interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of tetrahydrofuran. Remarkably, the formulated electrolyte based on ternary anion and tetrahydrofuran solvent endows the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode with considerable rate capability of 5.0 C and high capacity retention of 93.12% after 200 cycles. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells deliver Coulombic efficiency above 99% at both 25 and &#8208;30 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Modulation: Enabling Highly Conductive Stable Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising ionic conductors for developing high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, developing SPEs with both high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility remains a challenge. Here, we propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte (termed AMPE) for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Specifically, we design the AMPE by incorporating high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit. The high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density segments contribute to achieving a decent voltage tolerance of the polymer chains and ensure sufficient carrier ions. The anion receptor, represented by a boron&#8208;containing molecule, promotes the generation of free Li+ by dissociating anion&#8208;cation pairs. More importantly, the strong interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient B and the TFSI&#8722; in the matrix promotes the anion reduction to form a stable anion&#8208;derived mosaic&#8208;like solid electrolyte interphase on the Li&#8208;metal anode. As a result, the AMPE exhibits a high Li+ conductivity of 3.80&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and effectively suppresses lithium dendrites, enabling an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li|AMPE|LiCoO2 cell to achieve a cycle life of 700 cycles at an operating voltage of 4.40 V. This design concept would inspire efforts to develop high&#8208;performance SPEs for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>LAMP&#8208;MS for Locus&#8208;Specific Visual Quantification of DNA 5mC and RNA m6A Using Ultra&#8208;Low Input</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the effectiveness of utilizing circulating cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) for disease screening remains a challenge, necessitating improved sensitivity, specificity, cost&#8208;efficiency, and patient adherence. We present here LAMP&#8208;MS, an innovative technology that integrates linear amplification with single&#8208;base quantitative nucleic acid mass spectrometry on silicon chips. This approach overcomes several limitations in utilizing cfDNA 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) status for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. LAMP&#8208;MS enables unbiased amplification of as little as 1 ng of cfDNA, site&#8208;specifically quantify methylation levels of tens to hundreds of 5mC sites, thereby facilitating cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;resolution quantitative detection of cfDNA methylation markers. We have validated the accuracy of DNA methylation determination using DNA probes and cfDNA from patient plasma samples, confirmed by mass spectrometric peak areas. Additionally, we have further shown this Mass Array technology could be expanded to also quantify RNA m6A modification sites. Combining the ability to work with ultra&#8208;low input materials and a visually interpretable output, LAMP&#8208;MS stands out as a promising method for real&#8208;world applications in clinics and laboratories for nucleic acid methylation detection and quantification.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;potential and Stable Bipolar Cathode for Rechargeable Batteries with Fast&#8208;charging and Wide&#8208;temperature Adaptability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic carbonyl compounds have been recognized as promising electrodes due to multiple active sites, abundant element resources and flexible structural designability, while their practical applications are still hindered by the easy solubility and low discharge potential. Herein, a novel bipolar polymer composite (TAC) was well&#8208;designed by grafting p&#8208;type triphenylamine units onto n&#8208;type anthraquinone to form an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and in&#8208;situ growing on carbon nanotubes, which was proved not only with higher discharge potential but also effectively suppress the dissolution issues. Moreover, TAC combined the advantages of different active sites and behaved a dual&#8208;ion storage mechanism. Benefitting from the in&#8208;situ polymerization process, TAC with tube&#8208;type core&#8208;shell structure exhibited enhanced electron transport and improved utilization of active sites, resulting in high capacity (193 mAh g&#8208;1), outstanding rate performance (fast charging within 17 s), long&#8208;term stability (a high capacity retention of 87% after 1000 cycles) and high mass loading (10 mg cm&#8208;2). Additionally, TAC can well adapt to the temperature change, outputting a capacity of 72 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;60 &#176;C and&#160;165 mAh g&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C. Such versatile polymer structure inspires the design of high performance organic materials for rechargeable batteries to satisfy high stability and wide temperature operations.</dc:description>

Herein, a novel bipolar polymer composite (TAC) was well-designed by grafting p-type triphenylamine units onto n-type anthraquinone to form an extended &#960;-conjugated structure and in-situ growing on carbon nanotubes, which was proved not only with higher discharge potential but also effectively suppress the dissolution issues. Moreover, TAC combined the advantages of different active sites and behaved a dual-ion storage mechanism. Benefitting from the in-situ polymerization process, TAC with tube-type core-shell structure exhibited enhanced electron transport and improved utilization of active sites, resulting in high capacity (193 mAh g-1), outstanding rate performance (fast charging within 17 s), long-term stability (a high capacity retention of 87% after 1000 cycles) and high mass loading (10 mg cm-2). Additionally, TAC can well adapt to the temperature change, outputting a capacity of 72 mAh g-1 at -60 &#176;C and&#160;165 mAh g-1 at 80 &#176;C. Such versatile polymer structure inspires the design of high performance organic materials for rechargeable batteries to satisfy high stability and wide temperature operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrated Ziegler&#8208;Natta/Brookhart&#8208;Ni Catalysts for the Synthesis of Sutured Polar High&#8208;Impact Polypropylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes using industrially&#8208;preferred heterogeneous catalysts is challenging due to the poisoning of polar functional groups towards metal center and the high stereo&#8208;selectivity requirement. In this work, dual&#8208;site catalysts combining Ziegler&#8208;Natta and Brookhart&#8208;Ni catalysts were used to produce polar polyolefin ionomers, followed by polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes containing isotactic polypropylene and branched polyethylene as toughening agents. Three combination modes between these catalysts were investigated, including mixed, core&#8208;shell, and integrated types. The integrated dual&#8208;site catalyst achieved the optimal material properties because the polyolefin ionomer acted as a suture molecule that stitched different components into a whole network. This produced sutured polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes with excellent mechanical properties and compatibility with polar substances. The restraining effect of the suture molecules greatly reduced the release of microplastic particles after aging. Moreover, the obtained polar high&#8208;impact polypropylene can serve as an efficient compatibilizer to recycle polyethylene/polypropylene mixed&#8208;waste plastics. This work provides an appealing and potentially practical strategy to upgrade the widely used polypropylenes and to alleviate the ever&#8208;growing plastic pollution issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Heavy n&#8208;type Behaviours in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Non&#8208;Conjugated Passivants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial issues between the perovskite film and electron transport layer greatly limit the efficiency and stability of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Despite organic ammonium passivants have been widely established as interfacial layers, they failed to improve electron extraction. Here, we reported that the heavy n&#8208;type characteristics in a low bandgap perovskite film could be modulated by incorporating non&#8208;conjugated ammonium passivants with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing abilities. This resulted in a significant enhancement of electron extraction in the heavily n&#8208;type doped perovskite. The passivant&#8208;treated PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 25.74% with an excellent fill factor of 85.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.166 V, which are significantly higher than that of the control device. The unencapsulated devices maintained 88% of their initial PCEs after 1,200 hours at 85 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Simple Deformations to Elicit Complex Motions and Directed Swimming of Smart Organic Crystals with Controllable Thickness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of control over the crystal growth in a systematic way currently stands as an unsurmountable impediment to the preparation of dynamic crystals as soft robots; in effect, the mechanical effects of molecular crystals have become a subject of scattered reports that pertain only to specific crystal sizes and actuation conditions, often without the ability to establish or confirm systematic trends. One of the factors that prevents the verification of such performance is the unavailability of strategies for effectively controlling crystal size and aspect ratio, where crystals of serendipitous size are harvested from crystallization solution. Here we devised a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals of chemical variants of 9&#8208;anthracene derivative (chemical substitution of the 9th carbon) crystals with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. By capitalizing on the robust mechanical flexibility and deformability of crystals, we demonstrate systematic variations in crystal deformation that are further elevated in complexity to construct crystal&#8208;based robots capable of motions reminiscent of controllable sailing and humanoid movements. The results illustrate an approach to eliminate a critical obstacle&#160;towards complete control over the motility of dynamic molecular crystals as microrobots in nonaerial environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Se&#8208;S Bonds by Synergistic Rh(II)/Guanidine Catalysis Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Assistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient construction of chalcogen&#8208;atom&#8208;based chiral compounds remains a challenge, despite the importance of organoselenium and organosulfur compounds in life and materials science. Chalcogen atoms can form net attractive interactions called chalcogen bonds, but it is an undeveloped tool to assist asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report an enantioselective insertion platform to install a stereogenic center bearing selanyl and thiocyano functional groups. Our method operates by synergistic catalysis by a chiral guanidine and an achiral dirhodium complex in a three&#8208;component or four&#8208;component reaction, through Se&#8208;S bond insertion into carbene species, competing successfully with the spontaneous racemic process and showing high regioselectivity. As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selanylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory toward IL&#8208;1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.</dc:description>
