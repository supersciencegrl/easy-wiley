         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Carburization of Mo Oxide with Unprecedented High CO Formation Rate in Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoCx) during reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo&#8208;based catalysts are removed in H2&#8208;containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoCx phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt&#8208;dopants in MoOx. The structural evolution from MoOx to MoCx is accompanied by enhanced CO2 conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6 mmol&#183;gcatal&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at 600 &#176;C has been achieved over in&#8208;situ carbonized H&#8208;intercalated MoO3 catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts. During 100 h stability test only a minimal deactivation rate of 2.3% is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfate Derivatives with Heteroleptic Tetrahedra: New Deep&#8208;ultraviolet Birefringent Materials in which Weak Interactions Modulate Functional Module Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) birefringent materials are urgently needed to facilitate light polarization in deep&#8208;UV lithography. Maximizing anisotropy by regulating the alignment of functional modules is essential for improving the linear optical performance of birefringent materials. In this work, we proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials that achieve functional module ordering via weak interactions. Following this strategy, four compounds CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, C(NH2)3SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CF3 were identified as high&#8208;performance candidates for deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials. The millimeter&#8208;sized crystals of CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CH3 were grown, and the transmittance spectra show that their cutoff edges are below 200 nm. CN4H7SO3CF3 exhibits the largest birefringence (0.149 @ 546 nm, 0.395 @ 200 nm) in the deep&#8208;UV region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives. It reveals that the hydrogen bond can modulate the module ordering of the heteroleptic tetrahedra and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations, thus greatly enhancing the birefringence. Our study not only discovers new deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials but also provides an upgraded strategy for optimizing optical anisotropy to achieve efficient birefringence.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic Nanomaterial with Organelle&#8208;Level Precision Primes Antitumor Immunity via mtDNA&#8208;dependent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New generation of nanomaterials with organelle&#8208;level precision provide significant promise for targeted attacks on mitochondria, exhibiting remarkable therapeutic potency. Here, we report a novel amphiphilic phenolic polymer (PF) for the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can trigger excessive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damages by the synergistic action of oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking. Moreover, the phenolic units on PF enable further self&#8208;assembly with Mn2+ via metal&#8208;phenolic coordination to form metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial (PFM). We focus on the synergistic activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by Mn2+ and tumor&#8208;derived mtDNA in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), and subsequently repolarizing M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype. We highlight that PFM facilitates the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;dependent immunity at the organelle level for potent antitumor efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumours. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanistically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.</dc:description>

         <title>Title Selective Coupling of &#946;&#8208;(Borylvinyl)silanes by a Gold&#8208;catalyzed Hiyama Reaction &#8211; An Easy Way to Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Vinyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates as potent building modules are challenging to synthesize. Herein, we present a convenient strategy based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed Hiyama arylation of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(borylvinyl)silanes which are easily accessible by hydroboration of silylalkynes. By exploiting the highly electronegative nature of the Au(III) intermediate (which is accessed by the light&#8208;assisted oxidation with aryl diazonium salts), a selective activation of the silyl group in the presence of the boron moiety is achieved. This opens a route to selectively synthesize diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad substrate range, excellent functional group tolerance and perfect chemo&#8208;selectivity. Experimental studies and DFT calculations allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction, the synthetic potential was demonstrated by downstream transformations providing a facile route to bifunctional phenanthrenes and triaryl&#8208;substituted olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>25.71%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by A Thiourea&#8208;based Isomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various isomers have been developed to regulate the morphology and reduce defects in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells. To insight the structure&#8208;function&#8208;effect correlations for the isomerization of thiourea derivatives on the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we developed two thiourea derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB). Supported by experimental and calculated results, it was found that AT can bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ defect through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.818 eV, which is much higher than that from the synergistic interaction between two &#8208;NH&#8208; groups in HB and perovskite (1.015 eV). Moreover, the stronger interaction between AT and Pb2+ regulates the crystallization process of perovskite film to obtain a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with high crystallinity, large grain size, and low defect density. Consequently, the AT&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device engenders an efficiency of 25.71% (certified as 24.66%), which is greatly higher than control (23.74%) and HB&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 devices (25.05%). The resultant device exhibits a remarkable stability for maintaining 91.0% and 95.2% of its initial efficiency after aging 2000 h in air condition or tracking at maximum power point for 1000 h, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12 SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of 7&#8208;Azaindole&#8208;Based Robust Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Gas Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>7&#8208;Azaindole has been integrated as building block with complementary N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonding sites for the synthesis of a tetrahedral molecular tecton, namely tetra(&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)methane, TACM. The self&#8208;assembly of this molecule results in a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). This supramolecular structure constitutes a crystalline microporous material with an extraordinary thermal and chemical robustness. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals how the five&#8208;fold catenation of diamonoid systems, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, form an interpenetrated network with monodimensional channels. The structural features of the crystalline material are also observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, the microporosity of the activated TACM&#8208;HOF is characterized by gas sorption (N2, CO2, CH4 and H2) experiments performed at different pressures. A selective adsorption is observed for CO2 uptake and TACM&#8208;HOF also presents a good adsorption capacity for H2 among supramolecular organic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Dynamic Evolution of Electrolyte Configuration on the Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface by Visualizing (De)Solvation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is crucial for improving cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high charging cut&#8208;off voltages. However, typical electrolyte modification strategies always focus on the solvation structure in the bulk region, but consistently neglect the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which directly influences the CEI construction. Herein, we reveal an anti&#8208;synergy effect between Li+&#8208;solvation and interfacial electric field by visualizing the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which determines the concentration of interfacial solvated&#8208;Li+. The Li+ solvation in the charging process facilitates the construction of a concentrated (Li+&#8208;solvent/anion&#8208;rich) interface and anion&#8208;derived CEI, while the repulsive force derived from interfacial electric field induces the formation of a diluted (solvent&#8208;rich) interface and solvent&#8208;derived CEI. Modifying the electrochemical protocols and electrolyte formulation, we regulate the &#8220;inflection voltage&#8221; arising from the anti&#8208;synergy effect and prolong the lifetime of the concentrated interface, which further improves the functionality of CEI architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Iridium Catalyzed Electrochemical Formic Acid Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is a pivotal model for understanding organic fuel oxidation and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Here, we present mechanistic insights into a novel molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8208;N4&#8208;C) for FAOR. Our studies reveal that isolated sites facilitate a preferential dehydrogenation pathway, circumventing catalyst poisoning and exhibiting high inherent activity. In&#8208;situ spectroscopic analyses elucidate that weakly adsorbed intermediates mediate the FAOR and are dynamically regulated by potential&#8208;dependent redox transitions. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate a parallel mechanism involving two key intermediates with distinct pH and potential sensitivities. The rate&#8208;determining step is identified as the adsorption of formate via coupled or sequential proton&#8208;electron transfer, which aligns well with the observed kinetic properties, pH dependence, and hydrogen/deuterium isotope effects in experiments. These findings provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism of FAOR, advancing our understanding at the molecular level and potentially guiding the design of efficient catalysts for fuel cells and electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Molecular Motions in Ternary Cocrystals for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic photothermal conversion materials hold immense promise for various applications owing to their structural flexibility. Recent research has focused on enhancing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and mitigating radiative transition processes. In this study, we have developed a viable approach to the design of photothermal conversion materials through the construction of ternary organic cocrystals, by introducing a third component as a molecular blocker and motion unit into a binary donor&#8211;acceptor system. Superstructural and photophysical properties of the ternary cocrystals were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The role of the molecular blocker in radical stabilization and photothermal conversion were demonstrated. Intriguingly, the motions of the entire pyrene molecules in the cocrystal have been observed by variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results. The excellent performance of ternary cocrystal as a photothermal material was validated through efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiments. The efficiency of water evaporation reached 88.7&#160;%, with a corresponding evaporation rate of 1.29&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, representing excellent performance among pure organic small molecular photothermal conversion materials. Our research underscores the introduction of molecular blockers and motion units to stabilize radicals and produce outstanding photothermal conversion materials, offering new pathways for developing efficient and stable photothermal conversion materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Photoactive H&#8208;Bonding EDA Complex Model Drives the Selective Hydrothiolation and Hydroxysulfenylation of Carbonyl Activated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel model of H&#8208;bonding EDA complex was first reported for the modular and selective hydrothiolation and hydroxysulfenylation of carbonyl activated alkenes with diverse thiols under visible light conditions.







Abstract
Excitation of photoactive electron donor&#8722;acceptor (EDA) complexes to generate radical is a promising approach in radical chemistry. In this study, we introduce a new model of H&#8208;bonding EDA complexes for the selective hydrothiolation and hydroxysulfenylation of carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenes with diverse thiols under visible light conditions. The reliability of this H&#8208;bonding EDA complex model has been confirmed by meticulous experimental and theoretical calculations. Mechanistic investigations have revealed the significant influence of the solvent in determining whether the excitation of photoactive H&#8208;bonding EDA complex leads to charge transfer (CT) or energy&#8208;charge transfer (En&#8208;CT), thereby controlling Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. Notably, the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analysis clearly shows that the excited state of the C=O&#8722;H&#8722;S EDA complex involves closed&#8208;shell partially covalent interactions.

         <title>Insights Into the Mechanochemical Glass Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ball milling is applied for the direct vitrification of a variety of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) at room temperature, highlighted by the preparation of the first Cu2+&#8208;based ZIF glass. This research significantly contributes to expanding the currently limited compositional range of MOF glasses.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses, known for their potential in gas separation, optics, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, benefit from the processability of their (supercooled) liquid state. Traditionally, MOF glasses are produced by heating MOF crystals to their melting point and then cooling the liquid MOF to room temperature under an inert atmosphere. While effective, this melt&#8208;quenching technique requires high energy due to the high temperatures involved. It also limits the scope of new material development by restricting the compositional range to only those combinations of metal ions and linkers that are highly thermally stable. An alternative, mechanical milling at room temperature, has demonstrated its capability to transform MOF crystals into amorphous phases. However, the specific conditions under which these amorphous phases exhibit glass&#8208;like behavior remain uncharted. In this study, we explore the mechanochemical amorphization and vitrification of a variety of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with diverse linkers and different metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+) at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate that ZIFs capable of melting can be successfully converted into glasses through ball&#8208;milling. Remarkably, some non&#8208;meltable ZIFs can also be vitrified using the ball&#8208;milling technique, as highlighted by the preparation of the first Cu2+&#8208;based ZIF glass.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Copper Dinitrogen Complex Supported by a Weakly Coordinating Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade Synthesis: The copper dinitrogen complex [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF=C(CF3)3) with an unprecedentedly high N&#8801;N stretching frequency of 2314&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and a positive charge of +0.10 residing on the terminal N atom is reported. Synthesis proceeded from Ag[Al(ORF)4] in a triple consecutive cascade reaction with CuI excess to obtain pure product without Ag+ contamination. [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] was fully characterized by NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, EDX, XRD and quantum chemical analyses.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and full characterization of the copper dinitrogen complex [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] 2 (RF=C(CF3)3) prepared by a cascade metathesis reaction of Ag[Al(ORF)4] with CuI&#8208;excess in iso&#8208;perfluorohexane (i&#8208;pfh) under N2 atmosphere. Title compound 2 features an extraordinarily high N2 stretching frequency at 2313/2314&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (IR/Raman) and was characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Quantum chemical charge displacement analysis based on natural orbitals of chemical valence (CD&#8208;NOCV) indicates that the copper&#8208;dinitrogen interaction is still governed by weak &#960;&#8208;backdonation, but is significantly reduced compared to all literature&#8208;known transition metal dinitrogen complexes.

         <title>A Conductive Binder Based on Mesoscopic Interpenetration with Polysulfides Capturing Skeleton and Redox Intermediates Network for Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating network was synthesized. The lithium sulfur battery assembled with this binder has excellent electrochemical performance, especially rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high theoretical energy density and readily available cathode active materials is hampered by problems such as sulfur insulation, dramatic volume changes, and polysulfide shuttling. The targeted development of novel binders is the most industrialized solution to the problem of sulfur cathodes. Herein, an aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell, which is capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating polymer network, is synthesized and investigated. Not only can the elastic skeleton formed by the copolymer bind the active substance under drastic volume changes, but also the rich ester and cyanide groups in it can effectively capture lithium polysulfide. Meanwhile, the conducting skeleton consisting of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) both provides the additional charge conduction pathways and acts as the redox intermediates, significantly accelerating the kinetic process of lithium polysulfide conversion. Based on the synergistic effect of the above mechanisms, the use of the prepared binder on the sulfur carbon cathode significantly improves the rate performance and cycle stability of lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Derived Carbon&#8208;Supported Metal Electrocatalysts for Energy&#8208;Related Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances on the different electroreduction applications of metal&#8211;organic framework derived carbon&#8208;supported metal electrocatalysts with customized structure, component, and electron structure are depicted. Thereout, morphology control, component/construction modulation and controlled metal loading strategies are systematically sorted out based on three key components of metal&#8211;organic frameworks, namely metal nodes, ligands and modifiers.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction reactions, as cathodic processes in many energy&#8208;related devices, significantly impact the overall efficiency determined mainly by the performance of electrocatalysts. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) derived carbon&#8208;supported metal materials have become one of star electrocatalysts due to their tunable structure and composition through ligand design and metal screening. However, for different electroreduction reactions, the required active metal species vary in phase component, electronic state, and catalytic center configuration, hence requiring effective customization. From this perspective, this review comprehensively analyzes the structural design principles, metal loading strategies, practical electroreduction performance, and complex catalytic mechanisms, thereby providing insights and guidance for the future rational design of such electroreduction catalysts.

         <title>mRNA Display in Cell Lysates Enables Identification of Cyclic Peptides Targeting the BRD3 Extraterminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to perform mRNA display selections against protein targets expressed in mammalian cell lysates has been developed. This approach circumvents the need for purified proteins to be produced, giving access to targets that are aggregation&#8208;prone, contain disordered regions or that require post&#8208;translational modifications.







Abstract
mRNA display is a powerful technology to screen libraries of &gt;1012 cyclic peptides against a protein target, enabling the rapid discovery of high affinity ligands. These cyclic peptides are particularly well suited to challenging protein targets that have been difficult to drug with small molecules. However, target choice can still be limited as screens are typically performed against purified proteins which often demands the use of isolated domains and precludes the use of aggregation&#8208;prone targets. Herein, we report a method to perform mRNA display selections in mammalian cell lysates without the need for prior target purification, vastly expanding the potential target scope of mRNA display. We have applied the methodology to identify low to sub&#8208;nanomolar peptide binders for two targets: a NanoLuc subunit (LgBiT) and full&#8208;length bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 3 (BRD3). Our cyclic peptides for BRD3 were found to bind to the extraterminal (ET) domain of BRD3 and the closely related BRD proteins, BRD2 and BRD4. While many chemical probes exist for the bromodomains of BRD proteins, the ET domain is relatively underexplored, making these peptides valuable additions to the BRD toolbox.

         <title>Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles through Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization Enabled by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient protocol for chiral dihydroisoquinolone&#8208;fused indolines through a cobaltaphotoredox catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/dearomatization of indoles. Mechanistic studies indicate the excited photocatalyst was quenched by cobalt(II) species in the presence of Salox ligand. The stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate suggest the irradiation of light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.







Abstract
Photocatalysis holds a pivotal position in modern organic synthesis, capable of inducing novel reactivities under mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions. However, the merger of photocatalysis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation as an efficient and sustainable method for the construction of chiral molecules remains elusive and challenging. Herein, we develop a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation reaction enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, providing a synergistic catalytic strategy for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with high levels of enantioselectivity (96&#8201;% to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies indicate that the excited photocatalyst was quenched by divalent cobalt species in the presence of Salox ligand, leading to the formation of catalytically active chiral Co(III) complex. Moreover, stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate with indole suggest that the irradiation of visible light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of an Improbable Directly Bonded Phosphorene&#8208;Fullerene Heterodimensional Hybrid toward Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid with fullerene directly bonded onto the surface (basal plane) of phosphorene via P&#8722;C bonds was theoretically predicted &#8220;improbable&#8221; due to the strong repulsion between phosphorene and neutral fullerene.It is now synthesized by an electrosynthesis method involving C602&#8722; dianion as an intermediate generated by electroreduction of C60, significantly improving the stability and visible light/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates of phosphorene.







Abstract
Phosphorene and fullerene are representative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nanomaterials respectively, constructing their heterodimensional hybrid not only complements their physiochemical properties but also extends their applications via synergistic interactions. This is however challenging because of their diversities in dimension and chemical reactivity, and theoretical studies predicted that it is improbable to directly bond C60 onto the surface of phosphorene due to their strong repulsion. Here, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to synthesize the first phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid featuring fullerene surface bonding via P&#8722;C bonds. Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) obtained from electrochemical exfoliation react with C602&#8722; dianion prepared by electroreduction of C60, fulfilling formation of the &#8220;improbable&#8221; phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid (BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60). Theoretical results reveal that the energy barrier for formation of [BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60]2&#8722; intermediate is significantly decreased by 1.88&#8197;eV, followed by an oxidization reaction to generate neutral BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60 hybrid. Surface bonding of C60 molecules not only improves significantly the ambient stability of BPNSs, but also boosts dramatically the visible light and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates, reaching 1466 and 1039&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 respectively, which are both the highest values among all reported BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free photocatalysts.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Streptamidine and Klebsazolicin Using Biomimetic On&#8208;Resin Ring&#8208;Closing Amidine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile on&#8208;resin ring&#8208;closing amidine formation method was developed to synthesize peptides bearing diketopiperazine derived cyclic amidine structure at the N&#8208;terminus. Natural products streptamidine and klebsazolicin as well as analogues were synthesized by using this method.







Abstract
Diketopiperazine (DKP) derived cyclic amidine structures widely exist in peptide natural products according to the genome mining result. The largely unknown bioactivity and mode of action are partially caused by the poor availability of the compounds via microbiological and chemical approaches. To tackle this challenge, in this work, we have developed the on&#8208;resin ring&#8208;closing amidine formation strategy to synthesize peptides containing N&#8208;terminal DKP derived cyclic amidine structure, in which the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization mediated by HgCl2 activation of thioamides was the key step. Leveraging from this new strategy, we finished the total syntheses of streptamidine and klebsazolicin. Meanwhile, eleven klebsazolicin analogues were synthesized for its structure&#8211;activity relationship study.

         <title>Unlocking Fast Potassium Ion Kinetics: High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium Dual&#8208;Ion Battery for Operation at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A potassium&#8208;based DIBs with superior cycling stability at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C is established by coupling MXenes anode with PTPAN cathode, in which the co&#8208;intercalation behavior of solvated K+ endows MXenes anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures.







Abstract
Energy storage devices operating at low temperatures are plagued by sluggish kinetics, reduced capacity, and notorious dendritic growth. Herein, novel potassium dual&#8208;ion batteries (PDIBs) capable of superior performance at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and fabricated by combining MXenes and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as the anode and cathode, respectively, are presented. Additionally, the reason for the anomalous kinetics of K+ (faster at low temperature than at room temperature) on the Ti3C2 anode is investigated. Theoretical calculations, crossover experiments, and in situ XRD at room and low temperatures revealed that K+ tends to bind with solvent molecules rather than anions at subzero temperatures, which not only inhibits the participation of PF6&#8722; in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), but also guarantees co&#8208;intercalation behavior and suppresses undesirable K+ storage. The advantageous properties at low temperatures endow the Ti3C2 anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures. The PDIBs exhibit superior rate capability and high capacity retention at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, after charging&#8208;discharging for 20,000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, the PDIB retained 86.7&#8201;% of its initial capacity. This study reveals the influence of temperatures on MXenes and offers a unique design for dual&#8208;ion batteries operating at ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Alkene Isomerisation Catalysed by a Superbasic Sodium Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using superbasic sodium amide NaTMP as a catalyst, isomerisation of alkenes at room temperature under mild condition has been accomplished. Isolation of organometallic intermediates and DFT calculations have revealed the key role on TMP(H), acting as a proton source and facilitatitng the migration of the double bond.







Abstract
Typically catalysed by transition metals, alkene isomerisation is a powerful methodology for preparation of internal olefins. In contrast, the use of more earth abundant main group reagents is limited to activated substrates, requiring high temperatures and excess stoichiometric amounts. Opening a new avenue for progressing this field, here we report applications of bulky sodium amide NaTMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) when partnered with tridentate Lewis donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) in catalytic alkene isomerisation of terminal olefins under mild reaction conditions. An array of distinct olefins could successfully be isomerised, including unactivated olefins, allylamines, and allylethers, showing the high activity of this partnership. In&#8208;depth mechanistic insights provided by X&#8208;ray crystallography, real&#8208;time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have unveiled the crucial role of in situ&#8208;generated TMP(H) in facilitating efficient isomerisation, and the choice of alkali&#8208;metal. Additionally, theoretical studies shed light on the observed E/Z selectivity, particularly accounting for the selective formation of Z&#8208;vinyl ethers. The versatility of our method is further demonstrated through the isomerisation of unactivated cycloalkenes, which undergo hydrogen isotope exchange to produce deuterated compounds.

         <title>Anodic H2O2 Generation in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes&#8212;Mechanistic Insight from Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local pH measurement reveals that main anion at the interface is HCO3&#8722;, at potentials where H2O2 is preferentially formed, regardless of the bulk electrolyte pH. A Au&#8722;Pt double barrel microelectrode demonstrates that the local HCO3&#8722; concentration is collectively determined by the oxidation current, buffer capacity, and bulk electrolyte pH.







Abstract
For the anodic H2O2 generation, it has been shown that the electrolyte composition can steer the reaction pathway toward increased H2O2 generation. Previous efforts made on composition optimization found that the impact of the molar fraction of carbonate species varies for different anodes, and therefore, controversies remain concerning the reaction pathways as well as the species involved in H2O2 formation. Considering that water oxidation results in the liberation of protons within the anode microenvironment, the corresponding acidification would cause an equilibrium shift between carbonate species, which in turn may modulate the reaction pathway. We determined the changes in the fraction of carbonate species in the vicinity of an anode by performing local pH measurements using a Au nanoelectrode positioned in close proximity to an operating anode by shear&#8208;force scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It could be confirmed that the main anionic species at the interface is HCO3&#8722;, at potentials where H2O2 is preferentially formed, regardless of the pH value in the bulk. The simultaneous use of a Au&#8722;Pt double barrel microelectrode in generator&#8208;collector SECM measurements demonstrates that the local HCO3&#8722; concentration is collectively determined by the oxidation current, buffer capacity, and bulk pH of the electrolyte.

         <title>Synergistic Electrocatalysis and Spatial Nanoconfinement to Accelerate Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Aqueous Zn&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur/nitrogen dual&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers spatially confined sulfur nanoparticles (S@S,N&#8722;CNF) composite with yolk&#8211;shell sulfur@carbon nanostructure is elaborately fabricated. Benefiting from both the synergistic electrocatalysis and spatial nanoconfinement of S,N&#8722;CNF host, S@S,N&#8722;CNF cathode exhibits reduced energy barrier and accelerated sulfur reduction reaction kinetics enabling highly improved aqueous Zn&#8722;S battery performances.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries based on the conversion&#8208;type sulfur cathodes are promising in energy storage system due to the high theoretical energy density, low cost, and good safety. However, the multi&#8208;electron solid&#8208;state intermediate conversion reaction of sulfur cathodes generally possess sluggish kinetics, which leads to lower discharge voltage and inefficient sulfur utilization, thus suppressing the practical energy density. Herein, sulfur nanoparticles derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks confined in situ within electrospun fibers derived sulfur and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (S@S,N&#8722;CNF) composite, which possesses yolk&#8211;shell S@C nanostructure, is fabricated through successive sulfidation, pyrolysis, and sulfide oxidation processes, and served as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for Zn&#8722;S battery. The S and N dopants on carbon can collectively catalyse sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) by lowering energy barrier and accelerating kinetics to increase discharge voltage and specific capacity. Meanwhile, the yolk&#8211;shell S@C structure with spatially confined S nanoparticle yolks is beneficial to improve charge transfer and lower activation energy, thus further expediting SRR kinetics. Furthermore, extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that S and N dual&#8208;doping can thermodynamically and dynamically reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (i.e., the transformation of *ZnS4 into *ZnS2) for the overall SRR, thereby significantly accelerating SRR kinetics.

Hollow core&#8211;shell Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space was synthesized by one&#8208;step spray drying and calcination for the first time due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, ratios, and shrinkage rates between CA and PVP, which ensures high energy density and relieves volume expansion, combining with regulation on Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier by doping Ni to achieve fast charging and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core&#8211;shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space (THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni) via a one&#8208;step spray&#8208;drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieving volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron conductivity and optimize Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;C). Notably, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity of 43.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2500&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core&#8211;shelled structure with tiny&#8208;void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast&#8208;charge and low&#8208;temperature Na&#8208;storage features.

         <title>Full Selectivity Control over the Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitroaromatics Into Six Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single catalytic system has been developed for the production of six products, namely nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo and aniline compounds, from nitroaromatics. Furthermore, a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics has been constructed based on systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities via oxygen&#8208;isolated characterisation techniques.







Abstract
A full selectivity control over the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics leads to the production of six possible products, i.e., nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo or aniline compounds, which has however not been achieved in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Currently, there is no sufficient evidence to support that the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics with the use of heterogeneous metal catalysts would follow the Haber's mechanistic scheme based on electrochemical reduction. We now demonstrate in this work that it is possible to fully control the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics into their all six products using a single catalytic system under various conditions. Employing SnO2&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles facilitated by the surface coordination of ethylenediamine and vanadium species enabled this unprecedented selectivity control. Through systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities, we have constructed a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Crucially, using oxygen&#8208;isolated characterization techniques is essential for identifying unstable compounds such as nitroso, hydroxylamine, hydrazo compounds. The insights gained from this research offer invaluable guidance for selectively transforming nitroaromatics into a wide array of functional N&#8208;containing compounds, both advancing fundamental understanding and fostering practical applications in various fields.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Synthesis of Non&#8208;Covalent Crosslinkers while Folding Single&#8208;Chain Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic combinatorial macrocyclic disulfides acted as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers, adapting to polymer folding. Initially, small macrocycles fold the polymer into a loose state, which then catalysed the formation of larger macrocycles to enhance folding efficiency. Our work deepens the understanding of interplay between adaptive synthesis and dynamic folding, advancing the strategy for replicating protein folding into functional nanoparticles.







Abstract
Peptide folding is a dynamic process driven by non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking leading to functional nanostructures for essential biochemical activities. However, replicating this process in synthetic systems is challenging due to the difficulty in mimicking nature&#8216;s real&#8208;time regulation of non&#8208;covalent crosslinking for single&#8208;chain polymer folding. Here, we address this by employing anionic dithiol building blocks to create macrocyclic disulfides as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers that adapted to the folding process. Initially, small macrocycles facilitated a low degree folding of a polycation. Then, this preorganized structure catalysed the production of larger macrocycles that enhanced the folding conversely. The self&#8208;adaptive synthesis was verified through the encapsulation of an anticancer drug, showing an updated production distribution of non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers and maximizing drug&#8208;loading efficiency against drug&#8208;resistant cancer in vitro. Our research advances the understanding of molecular systems by exploring species evolution via the structural dynamics of polymer folding. Additionally, adaptive synthesis enables controlled, sequential folding of synthetic polymers, with the potential to mimic protein functions.

         <title>Exploring Macroscopic Dipoles of Designed Cyclic Peptide Ordered Assemblies to Harvest Piezoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric properties of self&#8208;assembled cyclic peptides derived from &#948;&#8208;amino acids have been investigated by exploring their macrodipole. The packing of the cyclic peptides, which show unidirectional hydrogen bonds was found to determine the piezoelectric properties.







Abstract
Crystalline materials exhibiting non&#8208;centrosymmetry and possessing substantial surface dipole moments play a critical role in piezoelectricity. Designing biocompatible self&#8208;assembled materials with these attributes is particularly challenging when compared to inorganic materials and ceramics. In this study, we elucidate the crystal conformations of novel cyclic peptides that exhibit self&#8208;assembly into tubular structures characterized by unidirectional hydrogen bonding and piezoelectric properties. Unlike cyclic peptides derived from alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids, those derived from new &#948;&#8208;amino acids demonstrate the formation of self&#8208;assembled tubes with unidirectional hydrogen bonds. Further, the tightly packed tubular assemblies and higher macrodipole moments result in superior piezoelectric coefficients compared to peptides with lower macrodipole moments. Our findings underscore the potential for designing cyclic peptides with unidirectional hydrogen bonds, thereby paving the way for their application in design of biocompatible piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric materials.

Unlike cyclic peptides derived from alternating L- and D-amino acids, those derived from new &#948;-amino acids demonstrate the formation of self-assembled tubes with unidirectional hydrogen bonds. Further, the tightly packed tubular assemblies and higher macrodipole moments result in superior piezoelectric coefficients compared to peptides with lower macrodipole moments. Our findings underscore the potential for designing cyclic peptides with unidirectional hydrogen bonds, thereby paving the way for their application in design of biocompatible piezo- and ferroelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of a Dual&#8208;Factor Activatable Covalent Targeted Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an NCEH1&#8208;targeted covalent photoacoustic imaging probe activated under hypoxia. This probe potently and selectively labels NCEH1, an aggressive tumor associated serine hydrolase, in cells and is also activated under hypoxic conditions. Through covalent labeling and hypoxia activation, this probe offers selective and high&#8208;quality in vivo tumor imaging of aggressive prostate cancer.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality in biomedical imaging with superior imaging depth and specificity. However, PAI still has significant limitations, such as the background noise from endogenous chromophores. To overcome these limitations, we developed a covalent activity&#8208;based PAI probe, NOx&#8208;JS013, targeting NCEH1. NCEH1, a highly expressed and activated serine hydrolase in aggressive cancers, has the potential to be employed for the diagnosis of cancers. We show that NOx&#8208;JS013 labels active NCEH1 in live cells with high selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. NOx&#8208;JS013 also presents its efficacy as a hypoxia&#8208;responsive imaging probe in live cells. Finally, NOx&#8208;JS013 successfully visualizes aggressive prostate cancer tumors in mouse models of PC3, while being negligibly detected in tumors of non&#8208;aggressive LNCaP mouse models. These findings show that NOx&#8208;JS013 has the potential to be used to develop precision PAI reagents for detecting metastatic progression in various cancers.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s for Potential Alternatives to Engineering Plastic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a representative case study of tough, chemical resistant and closed&#8208;loop recyclable dynamic poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s of which their highly crosslinking nature was contributed by a synergetic effect of covalent ester&#8208;bond linkages and non&#8208;covalent hydrogen bonding, metal&#8208;ligand coordinations, subsequently endowing the fabricated optical&#8208;transparent materials with excellent mechanical properties, decent chemical resistance and facile closed&#8208;loop recycling capabilities, comparable with engineering polymers.







Abstract
Facile fabrication, low material complexity and closed&#8208;loop recycling are essential for polymer plastics to alter their linear product economy towards a cradle&#8208;to&#8208;cradle one. Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are one way to achieve that, which intrinsically exhibit decent mechanical properties like the thermosets but could also be easily recycled like the thermoplastics. In this work, we introduce rigid ester structural motifs into dynamic poly(disulfide)s to form a series of dual polymer networks. Owning to the coherence of soft/rigid segments and the reversible sacrificial crosslinking, they exhibit tailorable mechanical properties and good resistance towards different chemicals. Their closed&#8208;loop recycling is achieved via mild solvolysis, maintaining materials&#8217; mechanical integrities. It offers a solution as a sustainable replacement for engineering plastics which are massively under production but hard to be recycled.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One: Plasmonic Janus Heterostructures for Efficient Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design of a reduction co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;tipped and oxidation co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;capped Janus heterostructure, which reveals the benefits of efficient interfacial charge separation via transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively, to Au and RuN5 sites for selective organic synthesis and H2 production via photoredox paired reaction coupling.







Abstract
Janus heterostructures consisting of multiple jointed components with distinct properties have gained growing interest in the photoredox catalytic field. Herein, we have developed a facile low&#8208;temperature method to gain anisotropic one&#8208;dimensional Au&#8208;tipped CdS (Au&#8722;CdS) nanorods (NRs), followed by assembling Ru molecular co&#8208;catalyst (RuN5) onto the surface of the NRs. The CdS NRs decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) and RuN5 complex harness the virtues of metal&#8208;semiconductor and inorganic&#8208;organic interface, giving directional charge transfer channels, spatially separated reaction sites, and enhanced local electric field distribution. As a result, the Au&#8722;CdS&#8722;RuN5 can act as an efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and valorization of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Benefiting from the interfacial charge decoupling and selective chemical bond activation, the optimal all&#8208;in&#8208;one Au&#8722;CdS&#8722;RuN5 heterostructure shows greatly enhanced photoactivity and selectivity as compared to bare CdS NRs, along with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 40.2&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. The structural evolution and working mechanism of the heterostructures are systematically analyzed based on experimental and computational results.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Selenol&#8208;Yne Click (SYC) Reaction Enables Poly(selenoacetal) Covalent Adaptable Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a catalysis&#8208;free selenol&#8208;yne click reaction, we successfully synthesized polymers and dynamic materials. Selenoacetal&#8208;based materials exhibit exceptional reprocessing ability, self&#8208;healing properties, and recycling potential.







Abstract
The emergence of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) based on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) presents a promising avenue for achieving resource recovery and utilization. In this study, we discovered a dynamic covalent bond called selenacetal, which is obtained through a double click reaction between selenol and activated alkynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the &#916;G for the formation of selenoacetals ranges from 12 to 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, suggesting its potential for dynamic reversibility. Dynamic exchange experiments involving small molecules and polymers provide substantial evidence supporting the dynamic exchange properties of selenoacetals. By utilizing this highly efficient click reaction, we successfully synthesized dynamic materials based on selenoacetal with remarkable reprocessing capabilities without any catalysts. These materials exhibit chemical recycling under alkaline conditions, wherein selenoacetal (SA) can decompose into active enone selenide (ES) and diselenides. Reintroducing selenol initiates a renewed reaction with the enone selenide, facilitating material recycling and yielding a newly developed dynamic material exhibiting both photo&#8208; and thermal responsiveness. The results underscore the potential of selenoacetal polymers in terms of recyclability and selective degradation, making them a valuable addition to conventional covalent adaptable networks.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) was developed as a functional polymer coating for Zn, enhancing the cycling stability of the Zn anode and accelerating the storage rate of photogenerated charges. This enabled the fabricated photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries to achieve a high overall conversion efficiency of 13.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes the ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300&#8197;h, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12&#8201;% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.

However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene-1,3,5-triimine-2,4,6-trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes the ion-accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn-PDPTT//Zn-PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300&#8197;h, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Zn-PDPTT//AC zinc-ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. Zn-PDPTT//NVO zinc-ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn-PDPTT//NVO with high-performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12&#8201;% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc-ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine based covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. They displayed superior H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in H2O and O2 under AM&#8197;1.5G through the combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2&#8201;% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.

         <title>Engineering Robust Triazine Crosslinked and Pyridine Capped Anion Exchange Membrane for Advanced Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEM) for water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) is significant for green hydrogen production. However, the current AEMWEs are restricted by the poor mechanical strength and low OH&#8208; conductivity of AEMs, leading to the low working stability and low current density. Here, we develop a robust AEM with polybiphenylpiperidium network by combining the crosslinking with triazine and the capping with pyridine for advanced AEMWEs. The AEM exhibits an excellent mechanical strength (79.4 MPa), low swelling ratio (19.2 %), persistent alkali stability (&#187; 5,000 hours) and high OH&#8208; conductivity (247.2 mS cm&#8208;1) which achieves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AEMs. Importantly, when applied in AEMWEs, the corresponding electrolyzer equipped with commercial nickel iron and nickel molybdenum catalysts obtained a current density of up to 3.0 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V&#160;and could be stably operated ~430 h at a high current density of 1.6 A cm&#8208;2, which exceeds the most of AEMWEs. Our results suggest that triazine crosslinking and pyridine capping can effectively improve the overall performance of the AEMWEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric diboration of terminal alkenes is well established, and subsequent selective functionalization of the less hindered primary boronic ester is commonly achieved. Conversely, selective functionalization of the sterically less accessible secondary boronic ester remains challenging. An alternative way to control chemoselective functionalization of bis(boron) compounds is by engendering different Lewis acidity to the two boryl moieties, since reactivity would then be dictated by Lewis acidity instead of sterics. We report herein the regio&#8208; and enantioselective Pt&#8208;catalyzed diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan). A broad range of terminal and cyclic alkenes undergo diboration to furnish the differentiable 1,2&#8208;bis(boron) compounds with high levels of regio&#8208; and enantiocontrol, giving access to a wide variety of novel building blocks from a common intermediate. The reaction places the less Lewis acidic B(dan) group at the less hindered position and the resulting 1,2&#8208;bisboryl alkanes undergo selective transformations of the B(pin) group located at the more hindered position. The regioselectivity of diboration has been studied by DFT calculations and is believed to originate from the trans influence, which lowers the activation barrier for formation of the regioisomer that places the weaker electron donor [B(pin) vs B(dan)] opposite the strong electron donor (alkyl group) in the platinum complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling C&#8211;Selective Ring&#8208;Opening of Phosphiranes with Carboxylic Acids and Other Nucleophiles: A Mechanistically&#8208;Driven Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphiranes are weak Lewis bases reacting with only a limited number of electrophiles to produce the corresponding phosphiranium ions. These salts are recognized for their propensity to undergo reactions with oxygen pronucleophiles at the phosphorus site, leading to the formation of phosphine oxide adducts. Building on a thorough mechanistic understanding, we have developed an unprecedented approach that enables the selective reaction of carboxylic acids, and other nucleophiles, at the carbon site of phosphiranes. This method involves the photochemical generation of highly reactive carbenes, which react with 1&#8208;mesitylphosphirane to yield ylides. The latter undergoes a stepwise reaction with carboxylic acids, resulting in the production of the desired phosphines. In addition to DFT calculations, we have successfully isolated and fully characterized the key intermediates involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Promiscuity of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase Enables Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Tetralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of biocatalysis, discovering novel reactivity from known enzymes has been a longstanding challenge. Fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) has drawn considerable attention as a promising photoenzyme with potential green chemistry applications; however, its non&#8208;natural reactivity has rarely been exploited to date. Herein we report a non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of CvFAP inspired by its natural oxidative decarboxylation process, enabling the &#160;stereoselective synthesis of a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones with high yields (up to 99%) and e.r. values (up to 99:1). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving oxidized state (FADox) / semiquinone state (FADsq) redox pair and an electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) process of radical termination, distinct from the previous reports. To our knowledge, this study represents a new example of CvFAP promiscuity, and thus expands the reactivity repertoire of CvFAP and highlights the versatility of CvFAP in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8211;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8211;E&#8211;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120o (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60o (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8211;E&#8211;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimine guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58 &#177; 0.18) &#215; 105 M&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of One&#8208;Dimensional Blocking Layer to Mitigate Deficient Surface of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) single crystals are promising for optoelectronic application, but their high surface trap density and associated ion migration hinders device performance and stability. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) perovskites are designed and proposed as blocking layer at the crystal/electrode interface to mitigate the surface issues. As a model system, the interface ion migration in Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (FA=formamidinium) single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is obviously suppressed, leading to increase of T90 lifetime from 260 to 1000 hours, five times better than previously reported results. Besides, the reduction of surface iodide ion vacancies inhibits nonradiative recombination, thus increasing the efficiency from 22.1% to 23.8%, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Since the deficient crystal surface is a universal and open issue, our strategy is instructive for optimizing diverse single&#8208;crystal perovskite devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;metal sites drive tandem electrocatalytic CO2 to C2+ products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4%Pd&#8208;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2&#160;(Pz&#160;= Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5% with remarkable stability when using 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4%Pd&#8208;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that&#160;revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization&#160;on the Cu&#8208;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer&#160;more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu&#8208;Pd dual sites&#160;play a synergistic tandem&#160;role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current&#8208;densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8208;0.47 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50% at a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in&#8208;situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8208;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermoelectric Performance in Triplet&#8722;Ground&#8722;State Polymer Intrinsically Boosted by Enhanced Proquinoidal Characteristic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer thermoelectric materials featuring flexibility, lightness, and bio&#8722;friendliness have been paid increasing attention for waste heat recovery and energy generation. The dominant approach to optimizing the thermoelectric performance of most organic materials is chemical doping, which, however, is not always ideal for practical applications due to its tendency to involve intricate processing procedure and trigger material and device instability. The pursuit of single&#8722;component neutral thermoelectric materials without exogenous doping presents a compelling alternative. In this work,&#160;we designed and synthesized a high&#8722;spin polymer material, PBBT&#8722;TT, by simultaneously employing&#160;thieno[3,4&#8722;b]thiophene&#160;(TbT) and benzo[1,2&#8722;c:4,5&#8722;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT)&#160;units with pronounced proquinoidal characteristics, and its analogue, PBBT&#8722;T. Because of the enhanced quinoidal resonance, increased spin density, and strong intermolecular antiferromagnetic coupling, PBBT&#8722;TT exhibits high intrinsic electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which&#160;showcases an outstanding power factor of 26.1 &#956;W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;without doping, surpassing&#160;other neutral organic conjugated polymer and radical conductors. Notably, PBBT&#8722;TT exhibits&#160;remarkable ambient stability, retaining its initial thermoelectric performance over a 120&#8722;day period.&#160;Our finding demonstrates&#160;that modulating the&#160;intermolecular&#160;spin interactions in&#160;open&#8208;shell polymers through the introduction of strong proquinoidal units is an effective strategy for&#160;the development of&#160;doping&#8722;free, intrinsically high&#8722;performance polymer thermoelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Carbamazepine Analogs for Non&#8208;Invasive Neuroinhibition In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable derivatives of the antiseizure drug carbamazepine have been developed to inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand using light. Two compounds allow controlling hippocampal neuron firing and zebrafish larvae locomotion with light, and Carbadiazocine (right) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non&#8208;invasive illumination.







Abstract
A problem of systemic pharmacotherapy is off&#8208;target activity, which causes adverse effects. Outstanding examples include neuroinhibitory medications like antiseizure drugs, which are used against epilepsy and neuropathic pain but cause systemic side effects. There is a need of drugs that inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand without affecting other regions of the body. Photopharmacology aims to address this problem with light&#8208;activated drugs and localized illumination in the target organ. Here, we have developed photoswitchable derivatives of the widely prescribed antiseizure drug carbamazepine. For that purpose, we expanded our method of ortho azologization of tricyclic drugs to meta/para and to N&#8208;bridged diazocine. Our results validate the concept of ortho cryptoazologs (uniquely exemplified by Carbazopine&#8208;1) and bring to light Carbadiazocine (8), which can be photoswitched between 400&#8211;590&#8197;nm light (using violet LEDs and halogen lamps) and shows good drug&#8208;likeness and predicted safety. Both compounds display photoswitchable activity in vitro and in translucent zebrafish larvae.

     alt="Photoswitchable Carbamazepine Analogs for Non-Invasive Neuroinhibition In Vivo"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoswitchable derivatives of the antiseizure drug carbamazepine have been developed to inhibit nerve signals locally and on-demand using light. Two compounds allow controlling hippocampal neuron firing and zebrafish larvae locomotion with light, and Carbadiazocine (right) also offers &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; analgesic efficacy in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non-invasive illumination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem of systemic pharmacotherapy is off-target activity, which causes adverse effects. Outstanding examples include neuroinhibitory medications like antiseizure drugs, which are used against epilepsy and neuropathic pain but cause systemic side effects. There is a need of drugs that inhibit nerve signals locally and on-demand without affecting other regions of the body. Photopharmacology aims to address this problem with light-activated drugs and localized illumination in the target organ. Here, we have developed photoswitchable derivatives of the widely prescribed antiseizure drug carbamazepine. For that purpose, we expanded our method of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; azologization of tricyclic drugs to &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; and to N-bridged diazocine. Our results validate the concept of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; cryptoazologs (uniquely exemplified by Carbazopine-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and bring to light Carbadiazocine (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;), which can be photoswitched between 400&#8211;590&#8197;nm light (using violet LEDs and halogen lamps) and shows good drug-likeness and predicted safety. Both compounds display photoswitchable activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in translucent zebrafish larvae. Carbadiazocine (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) also offers &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; analgesic efficacy (mechanical and thermal stimuli) in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non-invasive illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages, most importantly it allows for the spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate based systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Isometric Donor&#8211;Acceptor Wurster&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer remarkable versatility, combining ordered structures, high porosity, and tailorable functionalities in nanoscale reaction spaces. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of isostructural, photoactive Wurster&#8208;type COFs achieved by manipulating the chemical and electronic nature of the Wurster aromatic amine building blocks. A series of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) Wurster building block molecules was synthesized by incorporating heteroaromatic acceptors with varying strengths between triphenylamine donor groups. These tailored building blocks were integrated into a 2D COF scaffold, resulting in highly crystalline structures and similar morphologies across all COFs. Remarkably, this structural uniformity was also achieved in the synthesis of homogeneous and oriented thin films. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence revealed a tunable red&#8208;shift in film emission exceeding 100 nm, demonstrating effective manipulation of their optical properties. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical studies exhibited a doubled current density (8.1 &#181;A cm&#8211;2 at 0.2 VRHE) for the COF with the strongest acceptor unit. These findings highlight the potential of these D&#8211;A&#8211;D COFs in photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and pave the way for further exploration of structure&#8208;property relationships in this promising class of photoactive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Vapor Responsive Metallo&#8208;Peptide Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid&#8208;state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one&#8208;dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H&#8208;bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air&#8208;drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis&#8208;)assembled at 60&#8208;70% RH driven by a rebalancing of H&#8208;bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis through Hydrogen Poisoning Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion from nitrate to ammonia is a key step in sustainable ammonia production. However, it suffers from low productive efficiency or high energy consumption due to a lack of desired electrocatalysts. Here we report nickel cobalt phosphide (NiCoP) catalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrocatalysis that display a record&#8208;high catalytic current density of &#8722;702&#177;7 mA cm&#8722;2, ammonia production rate of 5415&#177;26 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 99.7&#177;0.2 % at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE, affording the estimated energy consumption as low as 22.7 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that these catalysts benefit from hydrogen poisoning effects under low overpotentials, which leave behind catalytically inert adsorbed hydrogen species (HI*) at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereupon enable ideally reactive HII* at secondary Co&#8722;P sites. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for H2 evolution is blocked due to the catalytic inertia of HI* thereby the HII* drives nitrate hydrogenation timely. With these catalysts, the continuous ammonia production is further shown in an electrolyser with a real energy consumption of 18.9 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Potent and Intestine Specific P&#8208;Glycoprotein Inhibitor to Enable Oral Delivery of Taxol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P&#8208;gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol&#8217;s oral delivery. Because P&#8208;gp exists in many tissues, the non&#8208;selective P&#8208;gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post&#8208;modification, various benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16c with potent P&#8208;gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F = 0.82%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P-gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol&#8217;s oral delivery. Because P-gp exists in many tissues, the non-selective P-gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P-gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P-gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post-modification, various benzofuran-fused-piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16c with potent P-gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F = 0.82%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetically Induced Amination of Alcohols using MNi@Cu (M = Fe, Co) Nanoparticles as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of tertiary amines from alcohols (i.e. heptanol, dodecanol, cyclohexanol, benzylalcohol) and secondary amines (Me2NH (DMA), nPr2NH, nBu2NH) has been achieved in one step using trimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) displaying a magnetic core (Co4Ni6 and Fe3Ni7) and a Cu shell as both catalysts and heating agent in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. This methodology limits the redistribution reactions occurring on amines at high temperature leading to both much higher conversion and selectivity in the absence of solvent than usually observed using conventional heating. Moreover, Co4Ni6@Cu NPs were found moisture resistant, thereby allowing for performing the reaction with commercial DMA in water (40 % wt) with again high conversion and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonplanar Nanographene: A Hydrocarbon Hole&#8208;Transporting Material That Competes with Triarylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are essential for optoelectronic devices, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, and perovskite solar cells. Triarylamines have been employed as HTMs since they were introduced in 1987. However, heteroatoms or side chains embedded in the core skeleton of triarylamines can cause thermal and chemical stability problems. Herein, we report that hexabenzo[a,c,fg,j,l,op]tetracene (HBT), a small nonplanar nanographene, functions as a hydrocarbon HTM with hole transport properties that match those of triarylamine&#8208;based HTMs. X&#8208;ray structural analysis and theoretical calculations revealed effective multidirectional orbital interactions and transfer integrals for HBT. In&#8208;depth experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the nonplanarity&#8208;inducing annulative &#960;&#8208;extension can achieve not only a stable amorphous state in bulk films, but also a higher increase in the highest occupied molecular orbital level than conventional linear or cyclic &#960;&#8208;extension. Furthermore, an in&#8208;house manufactured HBT&#8208;based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime compared to those of representative triarylamine&#8208;based OLEDs. A notable improvement in device lifetime was observed for the HBT&#8208;based OLED, highlighting the advantages of the hydrocarbon HTM. This study demonstrates the immense potential of small nonplanar nanographenes for optoelectronic device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the activity origin of electrochemical oxygen evolution on heteroatom&#8208;decorated carbon matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification via functional dopants in carbon materials holds great promise for elevating catalytic activity and stability. To gain comprehensive insights into the pivotal mechanisms and establish structure&#8208;performance relationships, especially concerning the roles of dopants, remains a pressing need. Herein, we employ computational simulations to unravel the catalytic function of heteroatoms in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), focusing on a physical model of high&#8208;electronegative F and N co&#8208;doped carbon matrix. Theoretical and experimental findings elucidate that the enhanced activity originates from the F and pyridinic&#8208;N (Py&#8208;N) species that achieve carbon activation. This activated carbon significantly lowers the conversion energy barrier from O* to OOH*, shifts the potential&#8208;limiting step from OOH* formation to O* generation, and ultimately optimizes the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;limiting step. This wok elucidates that the critical role of heteroatoms in catalyzing the reaction and unlocks the potential of carbon materials for acidic OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Gold Nanocluster/Organic Semiconductor Heterostructure for Enhancing Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic microorganisms, which rely on light&#8208;driven electron transfer, store solar energy in self&#8208;energy carriers and convert it into bioenergy. Although these microorganisms can operate light&#8208;induced charge separation with nearly 100% quantum efficiency, their practical applications are inherently limited by the photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency. Artificial semiconductors can induce an electronic response to photoexcitation, providing additional excited electrons for natural photosynthesis to improve solar conversion efficiency. However, challenges remain in importing exogenous electrons across cell membranes. In this work, we have developed an engineered gold nanocluster/organic semiconductor heterostructure (AuNC@OFTF) to couple the intracellular electron transport chain of living cyanobacteria. AuNC@OFTF exhibits a prolonged excited state lifetime and effective charge separation. The internalized AuNC@OFTF permits its photogenerated electrons to participate in the downstream of photosystem II and construct an oriented electronic highway, which enables a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent in living cyanobacteria. Moreover, the binding events of AuNC@OFTF established an abiotic&#8208;biotic electronic interface at the thylakoid membrane to enhance electron flux and finally furnished nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Thus, AuNC@OFTF can be exploited to spatiotemporally manipulate and enhance the solar conversion of living cyanobacteria in cells, providing an extended nanotechnology for re&#8208;engineering photosynthetic pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine moleculesvia Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerodynamically Levitated Droplets as Small&#8208;Scale Chemical Reactors and Liquid Microprinters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets of various solvents can levitate for days to weeks over the same or another liquid spread over the walls of a rotating vial. Individual or multiple droplets can be levitated, and can be used as &#8220;airware&#8221; reactors or as &#8220;wireless&#8221; chemical printers requiring no external connections to deliver into a reaction mixture fL volumes and pg quantities of reagents.







Abstract
A thin liquid film spread over the inner surface of a rapidly rotating vial creates an aerodynamic cushion on which one or multiple droplets of various liquids can levitate stably for days or even weeks. These levitating droplets can serve as wall&#8208;less (&#8220;airware&#8221;) chemical reactors that can be merged without touching&#8212;by remote impulses&#8212;to initiate reactions or sequences of reactions at scales down to hundreds of nanomoles. Moreover, under external electric fields, the droplets can act as the world's smallest chemical printers, shedding regular trains of pL or even fL microdrops. In one modality, the levitating droplets operate as completely wireless aliquoting/titrating systems delivering pg quantities of reagents into the liquid in the rotating vial; in another modality, they print microdroplet arrays onto target surfaces. The &#8220;airware&#8221;, levitated reactors are inexpensive to set up, remarkably stable to external disturbances and, for printing applications, require operating voltages much lower than in electrospray, electrowetting, or ink jet systems.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Global Aromaticity of Aza&#8208;Superbenzene and Aza&#8208;Supernaphthalene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraazasuperbenzene (1) and a hexaazasupernaphthalene (2) were synthesized via a facile intermolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. The neutral compounds show localized aromaticity and slow dynamics, but their charged dications, tetracations and hexacations show global aromaticity or anti&#8208;aromaticity with &#960; electrons mainly delocalized along the outmost skeletons.







Abstract
All&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or macrocycles usually display localized aromaticity. On the other hand, incorporation of quinoidal units into the skeleton could lead to effective electron delocalization and global (anti)aromaticity. In this work, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle 1 and bismacrocycle 2 containing both para&#8208;quinodimethane and triphenylamine units are efficiently synthesized mainly through intermolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. They can be considered as a tetraazasuperbenzene and a hexaazasupernaphthalene, respectively, due to their similar geometry and electronic structures to the benzene and naphthalene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses reveal a largely planar geometry for both 1 and 2 and variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclose slow dynamic processes owing to restricted ring flipping of the phenyl rings. 1 and 2 can be easily oxidized into higher&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state species. NMR and theoretical calculations indicate that 12+ and 14+ show global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway, while for the bismacrocycle 2, its dication 22+, tetracation 24+ and hexacation 26+ exhibit global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity with a 54&#960;, 52&#960; and 50&#960; conjugation pathway along the outermost backbone, respectively.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Tetrahydroindole Skeletons by Rh&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Homopropargyl Enamides with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex catalyzes the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of homopropargyl enamides with alkynes at room temperature to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals with high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In this cycloaddition, the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the ee values of the cycloadducts.







Abstract
We have developed the Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of homopropargyl enamides (tosylamide&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes) with alkynes to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals. This cycloaddition proceeds at room temperature in high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with a broad substrate scope. The preparative scale reaction followed by substituent conversion on the nitrogen atom and the diastereoselective [4+2] cycloaddition with singlet O2 affords hexahydroindole&#8208;diols bearing three stereogenic centers and variable substituents on the nitrogen. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the ee values of the cycloadducts.

         <title>Polymer Free Volume&#8208;Controlled Molecular Clock and Emitter for Multicolored Transient Data Display in Advanced Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular clock and emitter consisting of pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP and PTF1 has been developed via an &#8220;one stone (rigidity) two birds (clock and emitter)&#8221; strategy. Combining the synergistical responses of both pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP and PTF1 toward the rigidity change of polymer network enables transient data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for innovative applications from data security to display.







Abstract
The booming demand on data security has aroused great interest for developing smart materials with temporal display feature and dynamic multicolor fluorescence. However, it remains challenging to implement both features on most responsive molecules. Herein, we construct a polymer free volume&#8208;controlled &#8220;molecular clock and emitter&#8221; via covalently embedding a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive molecular switch (i.e., spiropyran) into a polymer network (i.e., poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate)) with programmable crosslink density and free volume. By the aminolysis of pentafluorophenyl ester with different amount of diamine crosslinkers, pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP networks with controllable crosslink densities are generated, which have different confinement effects on the rate constant of SP/MC isomerization, thus leading to time&#8208;dependent photochromism. In addition, PTF1, a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to polymer rigidity, is introduced to further endow pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP system with phototunable dynamic full&#8208;color emission. Therefore, relying on their synergistical responses to the rigidity of the polymer network, we have successfully developed a versatile molecular clock and emitter via an &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; manner, which shows time&#8208;dependent data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for advanced encryption and anticounterfeiting with a high security level.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling via a NiII Aryl Amido Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile (XEC) reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides was achieved via an in situ generated NiII aryl amido intermediate. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8211;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8211;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between aryl halides and alkyl halides is a streamlined approach for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond construction, which is highly valuable in medicinal chemistry. Based on a key NiII aryl amido intermediate, we developed a highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical XEC reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that an amine secondary ligand slows down the oxidative addition process of the Ni&#8208;polypyridine catalyst to the aryl bromide and a NiII aryl amido intermediate is formed in situ during the reaction process. The relatively slow oxidative addition is beneficial for enhancing the selectivity of the XEC reaction. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8211;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8211;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates. This electrosynthesis system provides a facile, practical, and scalable platform for the formation of (hetero)aryl&#8211;alkyl bonds using standard Ni catalysts under mild conditions. The mechanistic insights from this work could serve as a great foundation for future studies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Carbon Superstructure&#8208;Supported Half&#8208;Metallic V2O3 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;metallic V2O3 was firstly reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZlBs. The half&#8208;metallic V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photo cathode delivered record zinc ion storage and photo rechargeable properties. This study offered a promising direction for the capture and storage of solar energy.







Abstract
Photorechargeable zinc ion batteries (PZIBs), which can directly harvest and store solar energy, are promising technologies for the development of a renewable energy society. However, the incompatibility requirement between narrow band gap and wide coverage has raised severe challenges for high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;functional photocathodes. Herein, half&#8208;metallic vanadium (III) oxide (V2O3) was first reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZIBs. Theoretical and experimental results revealed its unique photoelectrical and zinc ion storage properties for capturing and storing solar energy. To this end, a synergistic protective etching strategy was developed to construct carbon superstructure&#8208;supported V2O3 nanospheres (V2O3@CSs). The half&#8208;metallic characteristics of V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by ultrathin carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework for efficient and stable solar&#8208;energy storage. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photocathode delivered record zinc ion storage properties, including a photo&#8208;assisted discharge capacities of 463&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000&#8197;cycles. Notably, the PZIBs assembled using V2O3@CSs photocathodes could be photorecharged without an external circuit, exhibiting a high photo conversion efficiency (0.354&#8201;%) and photorecharge voltage (1.0&#8197;V). This study offered a promising direction for the direct capture and storage of solar energy.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes with Diverse Solvation Configurations for All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEE) with abundant solvation configurations are proposed for all&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The diverse and uniform solvation structures distribution enables the HEE possess much higher solvation configurational entropy than conventional aqueous electrolytes, leading to its superior anti&#8208;freezing ability and high thermal stability.







Abstract
Batteries always encounter uncontrollable failure or performance decay under extreme temperature environments, which is largely limited by the properties of electrolytes. Herein, an entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) with diverse solvation configurations is proposed to expand the operating temperature range of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The HEE possesses over 40 types of Zn2+ solvation structure with uniform distribution, contributing to its much higher solvation configurational entropy compared to the conventional aqueous counterpart (only 6 types). These effectively promote its anti&#8208;freezing ability under ultralow temperatures, with a high ionic conductivity of 0.42&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at a low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the entropy&#8208;driven property can simultaneously enhance the thermal stability under a high temperature over +140&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, the HEE can enable full cells stably working over a wide temperature range of &#8722;40~+80&#8201;&#176;C, performing over 1500 cycles with 100&#8201;% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 1000 cycles with ~72&#8201;% capacity retention at +80&#8201;&#176;C. This inspiring concept of entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte with quantized solvation configurational entropy value has charming potential for designing future special batteries with excellent adaptability towards extreme temperature environments.

         <title>Ln3+ Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Chiral Heterometallic Clusters Ln2Ag28</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 0D chiralclusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln=Gd) with TADF induced by the coordination of Ln3+ ions were prepared. In the absence of energy transfer between Ln3+ and Ag(I) hetero&#8208;metals, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8211;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions.







Abstract
A series of TADF&#8208;active compounds: 0D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) clusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln=Gd) has been synthesized. Atomic&#8208;level structural analysis showed that the chiral Ag(I) cluster units {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D exhibited similar configurations, linked by varying numbers of [Ln(H2O)x]3+ (x=6 for 0D, x=3 for 2D) to form the final target compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra and decay lifetimes measurement demonstrated the presence of TADF in L&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag14S12} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;Eu2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;0D. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag14S12} cluster units were induced by 4&#8201;f perturbation of Ln3+ ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8211;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster&#8208;based luminescent materials.

&lt;b&gt;Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; (Ln=Eu/Gd) and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt;. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} in &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt; displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt;. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} cluster units were induced by 4&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; perturbation of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) small enough, it can significantly increase &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster-based luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Boundaries: Giant Ultraviolet Birefringence in Dimension&#8208;Reduced Zn&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the dimension&#8208;reduction strategy, &#960;&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) was introduced into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2, resulting in the design of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(4HP)2ZnCl2], with birefringence reaching 160&#8197;times the original value (0.482@546&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals have essential applications in optical communication areas. Low&#8208;dimensional structures with inherited structural anisotropy are potential systems for investigating birefringent materials with large birefringence. In this work, the zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(p&#8208;C5H5NO)2ZnCl2] (1) and [p&#8208;C5H6NO]2[ZnCl4] (2) were obtained by introducing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) into the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2. Remarkably, 1 exhibits a giant birefringence of 0.482@546&#8197;nm, which is the largest among Zn&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) compounds and 160&#8197;times that of ZnCl2. According to structural and theoretical calculation analyses, the large optical polarizability, high spatial density, ideal distribution of the [(4HP)2ZnCl2]0 cluster, and the low dimension of 1 result in the dramatically increased birefringence compared to ZnCl2. This work will provide a valid route for accelerating the design and synthesis of compounds with excellent birefringence in low&#8208;dimensional systems.

         <title>Asynchronous Ring Opening of Cyclic Carbonate and Glycidyl Ether Induced Phase Evolution Towards Heat&#8208;Free and Rapid&#8208;Bonding Superior Epoxy Adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly&#8208;branched polyurethane capped by cyclic carbonate was reported to perform asynchronous crosslinking with epoxy. The distinctive ring opening kinetics between the cyclic carbonate and epoxide groups, combined with a moderate branching degree, result in unique phase evolution. This process effectively toughens the adhesive and rapidly increases shear strength at room temperature to a level suitable for structural bonding.







Abstract
Structural adhesives that do not require heating are in high demand in the automotive and electronics industries. However, it remains a challenge to develop robust adhesives that rapidly achieve super adhesion near ambient temperature. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature curable, fast&#8208;bonding, and super strong epoxy&#8208;based structural adhesive was designed from the perspective of cross&#8208;scale structure, which lies in threefold pivotal aspects: (i) high branching topology of glycerol carbonate&#8208;capped polyurethane (PUGC) increases the kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reaction, contributing to fast crosslinking and the formation of abundant urethane and hydroxyl moieties; (ii) asynchronous crosslinking of epoxy and PUGC synergistically induces phase separation of PUGC within the epoxy resin and the resulting PUGC domains surrounded by interpenetrated shell serves to efficiently toughen the matrix; (iii) abundant dynamic hydrogen bonds including urethane and hydroxyl moieties, along with the elastomeric PUGC domains, dissipate energy of shearing force. As a result, the adhesive strength rapidly grows to 16&#8197;MPa within 4&#8197;hours, leveling off to 21&#8197;MPa after 7&#8197;hours, substantially outperforming commercial room&#8208;temperature curable epoxy adhesives. The results of this study could advance the field of high&#8208;performance adhesives and provide valuable insights into designing materials for efficient curing at room temperature.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Photocatalysts: A Nanohouse Design Improves Photocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohouse&#8208;like S&#8208;scheme heterjunction photocatalyst is designed via a nanoarchitectonics strategy, exhibiting high photocatalytic nitrite reduction performance with an ammonia production rate of 2454.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.02&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm in pure water.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) is a promising route for environment remediation and sustainable ammonia synthesis. To design efficient photocatalysts, the recently emerged nanoarchitectonics approach holds great promise. Here, we report a nanohouse&#8208;like S&#8208;scheme heterjunction photocatalyst with high photocatalytic NitRR performance. The nano&#8208;house has a floor of plate&#8208;like metal organic framework&#8208;based photocatalyst (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), on which another photocatalyst Co(OH)2 nanosheet is grown while ZIF&#8208;8 hollow cages are also constructed as the surrounding wall/roof. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the positively charged, highly porous and hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 wall can modulate the environment in the nanohouse by (i) NO3&#8722; enrichment/NH4+ discharge and (ii) suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In combination with the enhanced electron&#8208;hole separation and strong redox capability in the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125@Co(OH)2 S&#8208;scheme heterjunction confined in the nano&#8208;house, the designed photocatalyst delivers an ammonia yield of 2454.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.02&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm in pure water. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of advanced photocatalytic NitRR photocatalyst.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.

&lt;p&gt;A polymer-to-monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene-based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo-DCv-LCN) is reported. The Azo-DCv-LCN can be programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo-DCv-LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv-LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv-LCNs are still limited to heat-assisted programming and polymer-to-polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene-based DCv-LCN with room-temperature programmability and polymer-to-monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene-containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water-activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv-LCN can be simply programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv-LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid-solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv-LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paired Electrolysis Enables Reductive Heck Coupling of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of aryl radicals generated at a carbon cathode from (hetero)aryl halides and protons generated at a carbon anode from H&#252;nig's base enables the efficient anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of olefins via a paired electrolysis pathway.







Abstract
The formation of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Among various methods to construct Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds, the reductive Heck reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes stands out due to its potential efficiency and broad substrate availability. However, traditional reductive Heck reactions are limited by the use of precious metal catalysts and/or limited aryl halide and alkene compatibility. Here, we present an electrochemically mediated, metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free reductive Heck reaction that tolerates both unactivated (hetero)aryl halides and diverse alkenes such as vinyl boronates and silanes. Detailed electrochemical and deuterium&#8208;labeling studies support that this transformation likely proceeds through a paired electrolysis pathway, in which acid generated by the oxidation of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) at the anode intercepts an alkyl carbanion formed after radical&#8208;polar crossover at the cathode. As such, this approach offers a sustainable method for the construction of Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds from (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes, paving the way for the development of other electrochemically mediated olefin difunctionalization reactions.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Accelerated Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Layer&#8208;Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devised a novel approach termed &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; to fabricate seven staggered stacking Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). This method leverages ionic liquids as both solvents and mediators, operating under mild conditions. Through meticulous selection, ionic liquids possessing appropriate molecular volumes and symmetric bipolar functional groups were identified as pivotal elements in manifesting the confined interlocking effect and steric hindrance essential for the synthesis of staggered stacking COFs.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;stacking behaviors are crucial for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) to define their pore structure, physicochemical properties, and functional output. So far, fine control over the stacking mode without complex procedures remains a grand challenge. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; strategy to synthesize 2D COFs with a tunable layer&#8208;stacking mode by taking advantage of ionic liquids (ILs). The staggered (AB) stacking (unlocked) COFs were exclusively obtained by incorporating ILs of symmetric polarity and matching molecular size; otherwise, commonly reported eclipsed (AA) stacking (locked) COFs were observed instead. Mechanistic study revealed that AB stacking was induced by a confined interlocking effect (CIE) brought by anions and bulky cations of the ILs inside pores (&#8220;key&#8221; and &#8220;cylinder&#8221;, respectively). Excitingly, this strategy can speed up production rate of crystalline powders (e.g., COF&#8208;TAPT&#8208;Tf@BmimTf2N in merely 30 minutes) under mild reaction conditions. This work highlights the enabling role of ILs to tailor the layer stacking of 2D COFs and promotes further exploration of their stacking mode&#8208;dependant applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Activation and Stereospecific Functionalization of Bis(boronic Esters) Derived from 2&#8208;Alkenes: Construction of Propionates and Other 1,2&#8208;Difunctional Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes can be accomplished by a strategy involving alkene diboration followed by site&#8208;selective activation and copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of the less&#8208;hindered boronic ester. This process allows a broad array of difunctional chiral products to be produced from simple olefin starting materials.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed regioselective activation of bis(boronic esters), followed by functionalization, is reported. A bulky activator is shown to selectively activate the less hindered boronic ester enabling it to undergo stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling to a variety of electrophiles. This steric&#8208;based regioselectivity provides a simple and efficient method to prepare highly functionalized, enantiomerically enriched products starting from simple alkenes.

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Oxides for Electrocatalytic Acidic NOx&#8722; Reduction Streamlining Ammonia Synthesis from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The continuous production of NH3 is achieved from air and water by coupling the plasma system and MEA electrolyzer. The catalyst's unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen oxide ions reduction reaction (NOx&#8722;RR) shows great opportunity for ammonia production under ambient conditions. Yet, performing NOx&#8722;RR in strong acidic conditions remains challenging due to the corrosion effect on the catalyst and competing hydrogen evolution reactions. Here, we demonstrate a stable La1.5Sr0.5Ni0.5Fe0.5O4 perovskite oxide for the NOx&#8722;RR at pH&#8197;0, achieving a Faradaic efficiency for ammonia of approaching 100&#8201;% at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type cell. At industrially relevant current density, the NOx&#8722;RR system shows stable cell voltage and Faradaic efficiency for &gt;350&#8197;h in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at pH&#8197;0. By integrating the catalyst in a stacked MEA with a series connection, we have successfully obtained a record&#8208;breaking 2.578&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 NH3 production rate at 20&#8197;A. This catalyst&#8216;s unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources. Techno&#8208;economic and lifecycle assessments reveal substantial economic advantages for this ammonia production strategy, even when coupled with a plasma&#8208;based NOx production system, presenting a sustainable complement to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process.

The inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) molecule, A6AP&#8208;Cz, based on asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene was designed. A6AP&#8208;Cz showed the extremely short lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) of 54&#8197;ns. Moreover, the reverse intersystem crossing (rate constant of RISC: kRISC=1.9&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) was faster than ISC (rate constant of ISC: kISC=1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) due to the negative energy gap between lowest excited singlet and triplet states (&#916;EST).







Abstract
In thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and suppression of intersystem crossing (ISC) are demanded to shorten a lifetime of triplet excitons. As a system realizing RISC faster than ISC, inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) with a negative energy difference (&#916;EST) between the lowest excited singlet and the lowest triplet states have been gathering much attention recently. Here, we have focused on an asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene (A6AP) core to obtain a new insight into iST. Based on A6AP, we have newly designed A6AP&#8208;Cz with the calculated &#916;EST of &#8722;44&#8197;meV. The experimental studies of a synthesized A6AP&#8208;Cz revealed that the lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) was only 54&#8197;ns, which was the shortest among all organic materials. The rate constant of RISC (kRISC=1.9&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) was greater than that of ISC (kISC=1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1). The negative &#916;EST of A6AP&#8208;Cz was experimentally confirmed from 1) the kRISC and kISC (&#8722;45&#8197;meV) and 2) the temperature&#8208;dependent &#964;DF. 3) The onsets of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at 77&#8197;K also supported the evidence of negative &#916;EST (&#8722;73&#8197;meV). This study demonstrated the potential of A6AP as an iST core for the first time.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printing Multi&#8208;Component Multi&#8208;Domain Supramolecular Gels with Differential Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wet spinning methods are used to 3D&#8208;print gel patterns based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs), with the chemical structure of the LMWG and its ability to generate AuNPs programming the conductivity of the printed pattern.







Abstract
We report the use of wet&#8208;spinning to 3D&#8208;print gels from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on the 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidenesorbitol (DBS) scaffold. Gel stripes assembled from DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 and DBS&#8208;COOH are printed, and their conductivities assessed. Printed gels based on DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 can be loaded with Au(III), which is reduced in situ to form embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The conductivity of these gels increases because of electron transport mediated by the AuNPs, whereas the conductivity of DBS&#8208;COOH, which does not promote AuNP formation, remains lower. We then fabricate multi&#8208;component gel patterns comprised of spatially well&#8208;defined domains of printed DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/AuNP (higher conductivity) and DBS&#8208;COOH (lower conductivity) resulting in soft multi&#8208;domain materials with differential conductivity. Such materials have future prospects in applications such as soft nanoelectronics or tissue engineering.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Rich Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce Sites in CeO2 Supported Patchy Atomic&#8208;Layer Pt Enable a Non&#8208;CO Pathway for Efficient Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective coupling of *CHO and *OH is induced by forming abundant super adjacent *OH intermediates and maximizing edge Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce active sites, thereby facilitating a non&#8208;CO pathway. This approach effectively circumvents the generation of *CO intermediates.







Abstract
Rational design of efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst that undergo non&#8208;CO pathway is essential to resolve the long&#8208;standing poisoning issue. However, it remains a huge challenge due to the rather difficulty in maximizing the non&#8208;CO pathway by the selective coupling between the key *CHO and *OH intermediates. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst of patchy atomic&#8208;layer Pt epitaxial growth on CeO2 nanocube (Pt ALs/CeO2) with maximum electronic metal&#8208;support interaction for enhancing the coupling selectively. The small&#8208;size monolayer material achieves an optimal geometrical distance between edge Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce sites and *OH absorbed on CeO2, which well restrains the dehydrogenation of *CHO, resulting in the non&#8208;CO pathway. Meanwhile, the *CHO/*CO intermediate generated at inner Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce sites can migrate to edge, inducing the subsequent coupling reaction, thus avoiding poisoning while promoting reaction efficiency. Consequently, Pt ALs/CeO2 exhibits exceptionally catalytic stability with negligible degradation even under 1000&#8197;s pure CO poisoning operation and high mass activity (14.87&#8197;A/mgPt), enabling it one of the best&#8208;performing alkali&#8208;stable MOR catalysts.

         <title>Topology Control of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Interlaced Unsaturated 2D and Saturated 3D Units for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topology control strategy is reported to modulate the electron states of metal&#8208;free COF catalysts via interlacing unsaturated 2D and saturated 3D units. The 2D/3D framework interlaced COFs with locally irregular dimensions and typical D&#8211;A properties show high 2e&#8722; electrocatalytic activity, with the central carbon atoms of tetraphenyl&#8208;based units as active sites.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic state of multicomponent covalent organic framework (COF) electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. However, the effect of dimensionality on their physicochemical functionalities is still lacking. Herein, we report an interlaced unsaturated 2D and saturated 3D strategy to develop multicomponent&#8208;regulated COFs with tunable gradient dimensionality for high selectivity and activity electrocatalysis. Compared with the two&#8208;component 2D and 3D model COFs, the 2D/3D framework interlaced COFs with locally irregular dimensions and electronic structures are more practical in optimizing the intrinsic electrode surface reaction and mass transfer. Remarkably, the unsaturated 2D&#8208;inserted 3D TAE&#8208;COF regulates the adsorption mode of OOH* species to supply a favorable dynamic pathway for the H2O2 process, thereby achieving an excellent production rate of 8.50&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Moreover, utilizing theoretical calculation and in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR experiment, we found that the central carbon atom of the tetraphenyl&#8208;based unit (site&#8208;1 and site&#8208;6) are potential active sites. This strategy of operating the adsorption ability of reactants with dimensionality&#8208;interconnected building blocks provides an idea for designing durable and efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Facet&#8208;dependent diversity of Pt&#8211;O coordination for Pt 1 /CeO 2 &#160;catalysts&#160;achieved by oriented atomic deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface chemistry of CeO2&#160;is dictated by the well&#8208;defined facets, which exert great influence on the supported metal species and the catalytic performance. Here we report Pt1/CeO2&#160;catalysts exhibiting specific structures of Pt&#8211;O coordination on different facets by using adequate preparation methods. The simple impregnation method results in Pt&#8211;O3&#160;coordination on the predominantly exposed {111} facets, while the photo&#8208;deposition method achieves oriented atomic deposition for Pt&#8211;O4&#160;coordination into the &#8220;nano&#8208;pocket&#8221; structure of {100} facets&#160;at the top. Compared to the impregnated Pt1/CeO2&#160;catalyst showing normal redox properties and low&#8208;temperature activity&#160;for&#160;CO oxidation, the photo&#8208;deposited Pt1/CeO2&#160;exhibits uncustomary strong metal&#8208;support interaction and extraordinary high&#8208;temperature stability. The preparation methods dictate the facet&#8208;dependent diversity of Pt&#8211;O coordination, resulting in the further activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. By applying specific preparation routes, our work provides an example of disentangling the effects of support facets and coordination environments for nano&#8208;catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide degrader&#8208;based targeting of METTL3/14 improves immunotherapy response in cutaneous melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>METTL3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment, although its oncogenic functions in melanoma development and potential for therapeutic targeting drug have not been fully explored. In this study, we define the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma development and progression. Building on this insight, we examine our recently designed peptide inhibitor RM3, which targets the binding interface of METTL3/14 complex for disruption and subsequent ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation via the E3 ligase STUB1. RM3 treatment reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis identified changes in immuno&#8208;related genes following RM3&#8208;mediated suppression of METTL3/14 N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase activity, suggesting a potential for interaction with immunotherapy. A combination treatment of RM3 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in significantly higher beneficial tumor response in vivo, with a good safety profile. Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase RM3, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The energy densities of conventional aqueous batteries are often unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of electrode materials.Therefore, the design of creative aqueous batteries has to be considered. Herein, aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries are constructed by matching S/Cu2S redox couples and MnO2 deposition/dissolution. In such batteries, S/Cu2S redox couples undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction with four&#8208;electron transfer, ensuring a high specific capacity of 2220 mAh&#8201;g&#8208;1 in S anodes.Furthermore, the conversion reaction of S/Cu2S redox couples can take place stably in acidic electrolyte that is essential for the MnO2 deposition/dissolution. As a result, the S/Cu2S redox couples can match MnO2 deposition/dissolution well, which endow the batteries with a membrane&#8208;free configuration. As a proof of concept,&#160; Ah&#8208;level prismatic and single&#8208;flow batteries were assembled and could operate stably for over 1000 h, demonstrating their great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. This work broadens the horizons of aqueous batteries beyond metal&#8208;manganese chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Lighting Up Bispyrene&#8208;Functionalized Chiral Molecular Muscles with Switchable Circularly Polarized Excimer Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the further extension of the application scope of traditional molecular muscles, a novel bispyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecular [c2]daisy chain was designed and synthesized. Taking advantage of the unique dimeric interlocked structure of molecular [c2]daisy chain, the resultant chiral molecular muscle emits strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) attributed to the pyrene excimer with a high dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 0.010. More importantly, along with the solvent&#8208; or anion&#8208; induced motions of the chiral molecular muscle, the precise regulation of the pyrene stacking within its skeleton results in the switching towards either "inversed" state with sign inversion and larger glum values or "down" state with maintained handedness and smaller glum values, making it a novel multistate CPL switch. As the first example of chiral molecular muscle&#8208;based CPL switch, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study not only successfully widens the application&#160;scopes of molecular muscles, but also provides a promising platform for the construction of novel smart chiral luminescent materials for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Glycine from Methanol and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic utilization of methanol and nitrate as carbon and nitrogen sources for the direct synthesis of amino acids could provide a sustainable way for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste. In this study, we developed an efficient photochemical method to synthesize glycine directly from methanol and nitrate, which cascades the C&#8208;C coupling to form glycol, nitrate reduction to NH3, and finally C&#8208;N coupling to generate glycine. Interestingly, the involved photocatalytic tandem reactions show a synergistic effect, in which the presence of nitrate is the dominant factor to enable the overall reaction and reach high synthetic efficiency. Ba2+&#8208;TiO2 nanoparticles are confirmed as a feasible and efficient catalyst system for the photosynthesis of glycine with a remarkable glycine photosynthesis rate of 870 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under optimal conditions. This work establishes a novel catalytic system for amino acid synthesis from methanol and nitrate under mild conditions. These results also allow us to further suppose the formation pathways of amino acids on the primitive earth, as an extension to proposals based on the Miller&#8211;Urey experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of&#160;Highly Porous and Robust Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Capacity Clean Energy Gas Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of highly porous and robust HOFs&#160;for high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage remains a grand challenge due to the fragile nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing&#160;double&#8208;walled framework to target highly porous and robust HOF (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a) for extraordinary CH4 and H2 storage. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a features a minimized twofold interpenetration with double&#8208;walled structure, in which multiple supramolecular interactions are existed between the interpenetrated walls. This structural configuration can notably enhance the framework robustness while maintaining its high porosity, affording one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas of 3102 m2 g&#8722;1 and 1976 m2 cm&#8722;3 among the reported HOFs so far. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a exhibits an extremely high volumetric H2 uptake of 43.6 g L&#8722;1 at 77 K/100 bar and working capacity of 41.3 g L&#8722;1 under combined swing conditions, and also impressive methane storage performance with a 5&#8722;100 bar working capacity of 187 (or 159) cm3&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 270 K (or 296 K). SCXRD&#160;studies on CH4&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a reveal that abundant supramolecular binding sites combined with ultrahigh porosities account for its high CH4 storage capacities. Combined with high stability, super&#8208;hydrophobicity, and easy&#8208;recovery, ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a is placed among the most promising materials for H2 and CH4 storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8211;O&#8211;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8211; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8211;&#181;&#8211;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo-catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8211;O&#8211;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8211; species (where bTAML stands for biuret-modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity features of Lihium&#8208;organic batteries is essential for their practical use but remains a big challenge, which is due to the instrinsic poor conductivity, limited redox kinetics and low utility of organic electrode mateials. This work presents a well&#8208;designed donor&#8208;acceptor Covalent Organic Framework (COFs) with extended conjugation, mesoscale porosity, and dual redox&#8208;active centers to promote fast charge transfer and multi&#8208;electron processes. As anticipated, the prepared cathode with benzo [1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b':5,6&#8208;b''] trithiophene (BTT) as p&#8208;type and pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) as n&#8208;type material (BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF) delivers impressive specific capacity (218 mAh g&#8208;1 and 275 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 in ether&#8208;based and carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte respectively) and outstanding rate capability (79 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 124 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte). Moreover, the potential of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF electrode for prototype batteries has been demonstrated by full cells of dual&#8208;ion batteries, which attain comparable electrochemical performances to the half cells. Moreover, mechanism studies combining ex&#8208;situ characterization and theoratical calculations reveal the efficient dual&#8208;ion storage process and facile charge transfer of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF. This work not only expands the diversity of redox&#8208;active COFs but also provide concept of structure design for high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity organic electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Structural and Phase Transformations of MOF and Selective Hydrocarbon Gas Separation in its Amorphous, Glass Phase States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first wide&#8208;view image of multiple structural and phase transformations for MOFs from crystal state transformations further to the extreme limit approaching liquid/glass phase, was presented based on a square&#8208;layer framework of [Co2(pybz)2(CH3COO)2]&#183;DMF (Co2). The process involves i) an initial crystalline transformation brings to a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated and ordered vacancies contained framework [Co(pybz)2(CH3OH)2]&#183;2CH3OH (CoM) due to in&#8208;situ disassemble&#8208;reassemble, ii) thermal induced departure of a pair of cis&#8208;form coordinated methanol in CoM leads to amorphous framework (a&#8208;dCoM), iii) glass transition (Tg = 566 K) to super&#8208;cooled liquid (scl&#8208;dCoM, spanning 38 K), iv) obtaining MOF glass g&#8208;dCoM upon quenching the super&#8208;cooled liquid, and v) re&#8208;crystallization of super&#8208;cooled liquid to six&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia&#8208;net framework [Co(pybz)2]6n (rec&#8208;dCoM) under heating above 604 K. The access to glass from CoM, provides a new self&#8208;perturbation strategy to create more MOF glasses without melting. The wider pore size distribution in amorphous/glassy MOFs than crystalline precursor realized the first time selective hydrocarbon gas separation by breakthrough experiments, which bring efficient separation of 1:99 C2H2/C2H4 by either a&#8208;dCoM or g&#8208;dCoM and produce polymer grade C2H4 with purity &#8805; 99.5% after a single adsorption process. Furthermore, the mixture of 50:50 C3H6/C3H8 can be separated by a&#8208;dCoM.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Atom Pairs Stabilize *OCCO Dipole Toward Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deeply electrolytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high&#8208;value ethylene (C2H4) is very attractive. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8208;C coupling seriously results in the low selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to C2H4. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;based polyhedron (Cu2) that features uniformly distributed and atomically precise bi&#8208;Cu units, which can stabilize *OCCO dipole to facilitate the C&#8208;C coupling for high selective C2H4 production. The C2H4 faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 51% with a current density of 469.4 mA cm&#8722;2, much superior to the Cu single site catalyst (Cu SAC) (~0%). Moreover, the Cu2 catalyst has a higher turnover frequency (TOF, ~520 h&#8208;1) compared to Cu nanoparticles (~9.42 h&#8208;1) and Cu SAC (~0.87 h&#8208;1). In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique Cu2 structural configuration could optimize the dipole moments and stabilize the *OCCO adsorbate to promote the generation of C2H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Dynamic Proton Bridges Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction&#160;is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia&#160;for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction&#8217;s efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main&#8208;group metal&#8208;non&#8208;metal (O&#8208;In&#8208;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8208;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool. In&#8208;situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the In&#8208;S polarization pair acts as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites, polarizing the N&#8801;N bond by concurrently back&#8208;donating electrons to both the &#960;x* and &#960;y* orbitals of N2, thereby overcoming the significant band gap limitations, while inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8208;S polarization pair. As a result, the O&#8208;In&#8208;S dynamic proton bridge exhibits exceptional NH3 yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) across a wide potential window of 0.3 V, with an optimal NH3 yield of 80.07 &#177; 4.25 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1 and an FE of 38.01 &#177; 2.02%, outperforming most previously reported catalysts.</dc:description>

As a result, the O-In-S dynamic proton bridge exhibits exceptional NH3 yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) across a wide potential window of 0.3 V, with an optimal NH3 yield of 80.07 &#177; 4.25 &#956;g h-1 mg-1 and an FE of 38.01 &#177; 2.02%, outperforming most previously reported catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Cold&#8208;Pressed Garnet Composite Electrolytes with Enhanced Li+ Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) hold promise for realizing next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries with high energy density. However, the high stiffness of high&#8208;temperature sintered LLZO makes it brittle and susceptible to strain during the fabrication of solid&#8208;state batteries. Cold&#8208;pressed LLZO exhibits improved ductility but suffers from insufficient Li+ conductivity. Here, we report cold&#8208;pressed Ta&#8208;doped LLZO (Ta&#8208;LZ) particles integrated with ductile Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) via a Li+ conductive Li&#8208;containing Ta&#8208;Cl structure. This configuration creates a continuous Li+ conduction network by enhancing the Li+ exchange at the Ta&#8208;LZ/LPSC interface. The resulting Ta&#8208;LZ/LPSC SSE exhibits Li+ conductivity of 4.42 &#215; 10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1 and a low activation energy of 0.31 eV. Li symmetric cells with Ta&#8208;LZ/LPSC SSE demonstrate excellent Li dendrite suppression ability, with an improved critical current density of 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2 and a prolonged cycle life exceeding 600 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2. Our finding provides valuable insights into developing cold&#8208;pressed ceramic powder electrolytes for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Alcohols via Amine Modified Copper Nanoparticles at Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products (e.g. C2+ alcohols) offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. Use of strong alkaline electrolytes is favorable to producing C2+ products. However, CO2 can react with hydroxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate, which results in low carbon utilization efficiency and poor stability. Using acidic electrolyte is an efficient way to solve the problems, but it is a challenge to achieve high selectivity of C2+ products. Here we report that the amine modified copper nanoparticles exhibit high selectivity of C2+ products and carbon utilization at acidic condition. The&#160;Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reach up to 81.8% at acidic media (pH=2) with a total current density of 410 mA cm&#8208;2 over n&#8208;butylamine modified Cu. Especially the FE of C2+ alcohols is 52.6%, which is higher than those reported for CO2 electroreduction at acidic condition. In addition, the single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency towards C2+ production reach up to 60%. Detailed studies demonstrate that the amine molecule on the surface of Cu cannot only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which result in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Copper Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyrimidinyl Phosphine with both Axial and P&#8208; Stereogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines, renowned for their utility as ligands and catalysts, have been instrumental in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands possessing both axial and phosphine chirality remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the successful demonstration of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8208;P construction using in situ generated secondary phosphine and heteroaryl chloride. By introducing a chiral NHC ligand and an achiral diphosphine auxiliary ligand, we effectively alleviated the poisoning effect caused by phosphine(III) compounds and suppressed the nonenantioselective background reaction. The reaction exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with up to 96% ee, and good diastereoselectivity, with up to 14:1 dr, when employing less sterically hindered secondary phosphines. This particular substrate poses a significant challenge due to its strong poisoning effect in copper catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Alkaline Water: One Atom Makes a Significant Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, the construction of COFs with new active sites, high photoactivity, and wide&#8208;range light absorption for efficient H2O2 production remains challenging. Herein, we present the synthesis of a novel azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) with excellent performance on photocatalytic H2O2 production under alkaline conditions. Notably, although COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo differs by only one atom (&#8208;N=N&#8208; vs. &#8208;C=N&#8208;) from its corresponding imine&#8208;linked counterpart (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), the COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits a significantly narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity. Remarkably, when employed as a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo achieves a high photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at pH =11, which is 7.9 times higher than that of COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the &#8208;N=N&#8208; linkages are the active sites for photocatalysis. This work provides new prospects for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2&#160;laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8208;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH3 production rate of 10.9 mgh&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47 V versus RHE with exceptional stability. In&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active&#8208;species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, DFT calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8208;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study inspires the simple design of low&#8208;cost catalysts for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion and positions the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistically Different Mechanochromophores Enable Calibration and Validation of Molecular Forces in Glassy Polymers and Elastomeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sterically distorted donor&#8208;acceptor p&#8209;systems, termed DA springs, can be progressively planarized under mechanical load causing a bathochromic shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. By combining theory and experiment, we here use a simple linear force calibration for two different conformational mechanochromophores to determine molecular forces in polymers from the mechanochromic shift in PL wavelength during multiple uniaxial tensile tests. Two systems are used, i) a highly entangled linear glassy polyphenylene and ii) a covalent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane network. The mean forces estimated by this method are validated using known threshold forces for the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening reactions of two different spiropyran force probes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sterically distorted donor-acceptor p&#8209;systems, termed DA springs, can be progressively planarized under mechanical load causing a bathochromic shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. By combining theory and experiment, we here use a simple linear force calibration for two different conformational mechanochromophores to determine molecular forces in polymers from the mechanochromic shift in PL wavelength during multiple uniaxial tensile tests.

         <title>Unconventional Luminescence Polymer with Color&#8208;Tunability based on Solvent&#8208;induced Electrostatic Potential Distribution of Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the full&#8208;color emission of polymers holds significant promise. However, preparing unconventional luminescence&#160;polymers with color&#8208;tunability in dilute solution and understanding the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior remains a great challenge. We report two emitters (P1 and P2) incorporating tetracoordinate boron. The P1 with non&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, exhibited red delayed fluorescence at 645 nm with quantum yield of 9.15% in aggregates. Notably, the emission wavelength of P1 can be tuned from 418 to 588 nm at different solvent. Similarly, the emission wavelength of P2 can also be adjusted by manipulating the interactions between the solvent and fluorophore. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the B&#8592;N bond and electronic interactions between&#160;solvent and fluorophore significantly regulate the equilibrium the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the intramolecular O&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions of P1, thereby modulating its emission wavelength. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in fluoride ions detection. This work provides new insights into the complex effects of intermolecular interactions on luminescent properties.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Electronic Bridge on COF to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Scalable Covalent Organic Framework Membrane&#8208;based Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conventional covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based electrolytes with tailored ionic conducting behaviors are typically fabricated in the powder morphology, requiring further compaction procedures to operate as solid electrolyte tablets, which hinders the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of COF materials. In this study, we present a feasible electrospinning strategy to prepare scalable, self&#8208;supporting COF membranes (COMs) that feature a rigid COF skeleton bonded with flexible, lithiophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, forming an ion conduction network for Li&#8314; transport. The resulting PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes exhibit enhanced dendrite inhibition and high ionic conductivity of 0.153 mS cm&#8315;&#185; at 30 &#176;C. The improved Li&#8314; conduction in PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes stems from the loose ion pairing in the structure and the production of higher free Li&#8314; content, as confirmed by solid&#8208;state 7Li NMR experiments. These changes in the local microenvironment of Li&#8314; facilitate its directional movement within the COM pores. Consequently, solid&#8208;state symmetrical Li|Li, Li|LFP, and pouch cells demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance at 60 &#176;C. This strategy offers a universal approach for constructing scalable COM&#8208;based electrolytes, thereby broadening the practical applications of COFs in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy Effect on the Luminescent and Water Responsive Properties of Vacancy&#8208;ordered Double Perovskite Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskites and derivatives represent an important subclass of hybrid metal halides with promise in applications including light emitting devices and photovoltaics. Understanding the vacancy&#8208;property relationship is crucial for designing related task&#8208;specific materials, yet research in this field remains sporadic. For the first time, we use the Connolly surface to quantitatively calculate the volume of vacancy (V&#9633;, &#9633; = vacancy) in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives (VDPDs). A relationship between void fraction and the structure, photoluminescent properties and humidity stability was established based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0&#8208;D) [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8217;&#8208;type VDPDs.

Our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the photoluminescent quantum yield and V&#9633; in 0&#8208;D VDPDs. Additionally, structural transformation from A2SbCl5 to A3Sb2Cl9 was first reported, during which the novel 'gate&#8208;opening' gas adsorption phenomenon was observed in VDPDs for the first time, as evidenced by 'S'&#8208;shaped sorption isotherms for water vapor, indicating a cation&#8208;controlled water&#8208;vapor response behavior.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vacancy-ordered perovskites and derivatives represent an important subclass of hybrid metal halides with promise in applications including light emitting devices and photovoltaics.

For the first time, we use the Connolly surface to quantitatively calculate the volume of vacancy (V&#9633;, &#9633; = vacancy) in vacancy-ordered double perovskite derivatives (VDPDs). A relationship between void fraction and the structure, photoluminescent properties and humidity stability was established based on zero-dimensional (0-D) [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8217;-type VDPDs.

         <title>Simultaneous Structural and Electronic Engineering on Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;co&#8208;doped SrTiO3 for Promoting Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating metal ion&#8208;doped oxides as visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts requires intricate structural and electronic engineering, a task with inherent challenges. In this study, we employed a solid (template)&#8208;molten (dopants) reaction to synthesize Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3:Bi,Rh) particles. Our investigation reveals that SrTiO3:Bi,Rh manifests as single&#8208;crystalline particles in a core (undoped)/shell (doped) structure. Furthermore, it exhibits a well&#8208;stabilized Rh3+ energy state for visible&#8208;light response without introducing undesirable trapping states. This precisely engineered structure and electronic configuration promoted the generation of high&#8208;concentration and long&#8208;lived free electrons, as well as facilitated their transfer to cocatalysts for H2 evolution. Impressively, SrTiO3:Bi,Rh achieved an exceptional apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.9% at 420 nm, setting a new benchmark among Rh&#8208;doped&#8208;based SrTiO3 materials. Furthermore, when integrated into an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;scheme system with Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 and reduced graphene oxide, SrTiO3:Bi,Rh enabled water splitting with an AQY of 7.1% at 420 nm. This work underscores the significance of simultaneous structural and electronic engineering and introduces the solid&#8208;molten reaction as a viable approach for this purpose.</dc:description>

         <title>Vertically Fluorinated Graphene Encapsulated SiOx Anode for Enhanced Li+ Transport and Interfacial Stability in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high energy density has always been the goal of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx has emerged as a compelling candidate for use as a negative electrode material due to its remarkable capacity. However, the huge volume expansion and the unstable electrode interface during (de)lithiation, hinder its further development. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of surface fluorinated SiOx (SiOx@vG&#8208;F), and investigate their influences on battery performance. Systematic experiments investigations indicate that the reaction between Li+ and fluorine groups promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of stable LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of SiOx@vG&#8208;F anode, which effectively suppresses the pulverization of microsized SiOx particles during the charge and discharge cycle. As a result, the SiOx@vG&#8208;F enabled a higher capacity retention of 86.4% over 200 cycles at 1.0 C in the SiOx@vG&#8208;F||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell. This approach will provide insights for the advancement of alternative electrode materials in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, photoswitchable agents. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, photo&#8208;BQCisA and photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control over the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class A receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined strategy involving molecular dynamics simulations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to manipulate the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of PfNS protein resulted in the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions, such as the conversion between bicyclic and tricyclic structures and the transition from Type&#8197;B to Type&#8197;A function, thus resulting in the production of new sesterterpenes.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsis fici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS&#8242;s function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type&#8197;B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type&#8197;A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of Cu facets on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Li deposition behavior are demonstrated using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The strong adsorption of Cu(100) facet to anions guides more anions to participate in the inner Helmholtz plane and promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foil with a single [100] orientation display outstanding performance.







Abstract
The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

The strong adsorption of Cu(100) facet to anions guides more anions to participate in the inner Helmholtz plane and promoting the formation of the stable inorganic-rich SEI. Consequently, the single-crystal Cu foil with a single [100] orientation display outstanding performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single-crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic-rich SEI. Consequently, the single-crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s-Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite-free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s-Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah-level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high-performance Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Spinel Octahedral Sites via a &#960;&#8211;&#960; Type Orbital Coupling to Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in Co3O4 can be fine&#8208;regulated by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling involving the CoOh t2g, O 2p, and Ce t2u orbital. Mechanism investigations reveal that&#160;a &#960;&#8208;donation interaction between the bridging O 2p and Ce fyz2 orbital effectively bolsters the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. The obtained electrocatalyst with the eg occupancy optimized to 1.094 presents an excellent water oxidation performance.







Abstract
Spin state is often regarded as the crucial valve to release the reactivity of energy&#8208;related catalysts, yet it is also challenging to precisely manipulate, especially for the active center ions occupied at the specific geometric sites. Herein, a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling of 3d (Co)&#8208;2p (O)&#8208;4f (Ce) was employed to regulate the spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in the composite of Co3O4/CeO2. More specifically, the equivalent high&#8208;spin ratio of CoOh can reach to 54.7&#8201;% via tuning the CeO2 content, thereby triggering the average eg filling (1.094) close to the theoretical optimum value. The corresponding catalyst exhibits a superior water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 251&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, rivaling most cobalt&#8208;based oxides state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; type coupling corroborated by the matched energy levels between Ce t1u/t2u&#8208;O and CoOh t2g&#8208;O &#960; type bond in the calculated crystal orbital Hamilton population and partial density of states profiles, stimulates a &#960;&#8208;donation between O 2p and &#960;&#8208;symmetric Ce 4fyz2 orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. This work offers an in&#8208;depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.

         <title>A Fragment&#8208;Based Competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR Platform For Hotspot&#8208;Directed Ligand Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fragment screening identified three ligand binding hotspots across the active site of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium abscessus. Fragment sized fluorinated reporters were developed for each hotspot and used in competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR experiments to quantify hotspot&#8208;specific ligand binding affinities across three orders of magnitude, from low mM to low &#956;M.







Abstract
Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F Ligand Based&#8197;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of 19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single 19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of 19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling

         <title>Electron Transfer Enhanced by a Minimal Energetic Driving Force at the Organic&#8208;Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transfer from the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state to the first triplet excited state (T1) are investigated in upconversion organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with 45 different material combinations. According to our analysis based on the semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory, CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV) and is expressed by a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The energetic driving force for electron transfer must be minimized to realize efficient optoelectronic devices including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Exploring the dynamics of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state at an interface leads to a comprehension of the relationship between energetics, electron&#8208;transfer efficiency, and device performance. Here, we investigate the electron transfer from the CT state to the triplet excited state (T1) in upconversion OLEDs with 45 material combinations. By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited&#8208;state emission from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation via the dark T1, their energetics and electron&#8208;transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn&#8208;on voltage of 1.57&#8197;V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT states for efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light (1200&#8197;nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium&#8208;Intercalated NiAl&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH photocatalyst showed impressive infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity at &#955;=1200&#8197;nm (CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;%) and good stability over 50 re&#8208;use cycles. In situ DRIFTs, fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and DFT calculations showed that compressed anionic Ru complexes in LDH interlayers induced a dual charge redistribution phenomenon, narrowing the band gap (0.89&#8197;eV) in the hybrid photocatalyst system to enable efficient infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction (NIR&#8208;CO2PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO2 with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO2 photoreduction (0.887&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) with CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;% under 1200&#8197;nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98&#8197;eV) via a compression&#8208;related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light&#8208;induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO2PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO2 molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR&#8208;CO2PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR&#8208;CO2PR at wavelengths up to 1200&#8197;nm in LDH&#8208;based photocatalyst systems.

     alt="Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near-Infrared-Light (1200&#8197;nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium-Intercalated NiAl-Layered Double Hydroxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NiAl-Ru-LDH photocatalyst showed impressive infrared-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity at &#955;=1200&#8197;nm (CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;%) and good stability over 50 re-use cycles. In situ DRIFTs, fs-TA spectroscopy and DFT calculations showed that compressed anionic Ru complexes in LDH interlayers induced a dual charge redistribution phenomenon, narrowing the band gap (0.89&#8197;eV) in the hybrid photocatalyst system to enable efficient infrared-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared light-driven photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (NIR-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR-driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl-layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl-Ru-LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction (0.887&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;% under 1200&#8197;nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98&#8197;eV) via a compression-related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light-induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PR at wavelengths up to 1200&#8197;nm in LDH-based photocatalyst systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Driven Autonomous Janus Electromagnets as Magnetotactic Swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization of solenoidal Janus devices into magnetic dipoles is made possible by the efficient coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous and kinetically favored redox reactions taking place at each extremity of the object. This is a straightforward strategy for the design of non&#8208;ferromagnetic, chemically&#8208;driven electromagnets.







Abstract
An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets spontaneously transform the redox&#8208;induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#956;T upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on&#8208;board magnetization allows them to perform compass&#8208;like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine&#8208;tune its angular velocity.

         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carefully curated dataset of reactions catalyzed by magnesium&#8208;based catalysts underlies a Machine&#8208;Learning model guiding the choices of catalysts &#8220;optimal&#8221; for reactions unseen during training. When this model is tested by experiment, it suggests catalysts that yield higher ee values, replace rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts, or improve the efficiency of stereoselective transformations relevant to drug discovery.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221;&#8212;in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess&#8212;for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.

         <title>Photorefinery of Biomass and Plastics to Renewable Chemicals using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysts harness sunlight to convert biomass and plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemicals. These feedstocks utilize photogenerated electrons and/or holes to undergo reduction and/or oxidation transformations, enabling catalytic upgrading in a low&#8208;carbon, renewable energy&#8208;driven, and environmentally friendly manner.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste provides opportunities for sustainable fuel and chemical production. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, typically composed of semiconductors with distinctive redox properties in their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), facilitate both the oxidative and reductive valorization of organic feedstocks. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the photorefinery of biomass and plastics from the perspective of the redox properties of photocatalysts. We explore the roles of the VB and CB in enhancing the value&#8208;added conversion of biomass and plastics via various pathways. Our aim is to bridge the gap between photocatalytic mechanisms and renewable carbon feedstock valorization, inspiring further development in photocatalytic refinery of biomass and plastics.

         <title>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;Substituted Pentabenzocorannulene: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene, a new buckybowl bearing an internal sp3 carbon atom in the backbone, unexpectedly exhibits wide absorption and emission bands. The methyl group is exclusively located at the convex surface, bolstering the bowl geometry. All molecules form unidirectional bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking to generate polar crystals.







Abstract
exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9&#8197;kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93&#8197;&#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850&#8197;nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (2.01&#8197;eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.

         <title>Adaptive Helical Chirality in Supramolecular Microcrystals for Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular interaction strategy is proposed to synthesize organic microcrystals with adaptive helical chirality for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~0.7.

     alt="Adaptive Helical Chirality in Supramolecular Microcrystals for Circularly Polarized Lasing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral supramolecular interaction strategy is proposed to synthesize organic microcrystals with adaptive helical chirality for realizing high-performance circularly polarized lasing emission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high-performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high-performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~0.7. This work opens up the way to rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme can adopt a hammerhead fold, allowing them to process various substrates by utilizing their inherent activity and comprehensive conformational flexibility to support RNA cleavage and ligation.







Abstract
We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte design is presented. Based on an explainable method, the halogenoid property of the cyanide group is demonstrated similar to fluorine in molecular properties. 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the LiCoO2/Li cell operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3&#8201;% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Hyperpolarizing Small Molecules using Parahydrogen and Solid&#8208;State Spin Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization is a simple low&#8208;cost approach for hyperpolarizing molecules to enhance their NMR signals, but requires specific hydrogenation chemistry. A new approach is shown to hyperpolarize a wider range of target molecules via solid state mixing with a pre&#8208;hyperpolarized source molecule. The mechanism of polarization transfer from the source to the target molecules is solid&#8208;state spin diffusion.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an inexpensive way to produce hyperpolarized molecules with polarization levels of &gt;10&#8201;% in the solution&#8208;state, but is strongly limited in generality since it requires chemical reactions/ interactions with H2. Here we report a new method to widen the scope of PHIP hyperpolarization: a source molecule is produced via PHIP with high 13C polarization, and precipitated out of solution together with a target species. Spin diffusion within the solid carries the polarization onto 13C spins of the target, which can then be dissolved for solution&#8208;state applications. We name this method PHIP&#8208;SSD (PHIP with solid&#8208;state spin diffusion) and demonstrate it using PHIP&#8208;polarized [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;fumarate as the source molecule, to polarize different 13C&#8208;labelled target molecules. 13C polarizations of between 0.01 and 3&#8201;% were measured on [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid, depending on the molar ratio of fumarate:benzoate in the solid state. We also show that PHIP&#8208;SSD does not require specific co&#8208;crystallization conditions by grinding dry powders of target molecules together with solid fumarate crystals, and obtain 13C signal enhancements of between 100 and 200 on [13C,15N2]&#8208;urea, [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;pyruvate, and [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid. This approach appears to be a promising new strategy for facile hyperpolarization based on PHIP.

         <title>Kinetics of Strand Displacement Reaction with Acyclic Artificial Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetics of strand displacement by acyclic artificial nucleic acids were systematically investigated. Effects of toehold length, temperature, orthogonality, and heterochirality were determined. These data will allow rational design of novel nanotechnology devices based on artificial nucleic acids.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction, one of the DNA nanotechnologies, has great potential as s biological programmable platform in the cellular environment. Various artificial nucleic acids have been developed to improve stability and affinity for biological applications. However, the lack of understanding of the kinetics of TMSD reaction among artificial nucleic acids has limited their applications. We herein systematically characterized the kinetics of TMSD reactions with acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs): serinol nucleic acid (SNA), acyclic D&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (D&#8208;aTNA), and acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA). We found that the strand displacement reactions by D&#8208;aTNA and by L&#8208;aTNA were highly dependent on temperature. D&#8208;aTNA and L&#8208;aTNA systems were orthogonal to each other, and chirality of the input can be switched by using SNA as an interface. We also applied TMSD reactions of XNAs to a seesaw gate amplification system which utilizes the orthogonality. This work will contribute to the developments of thermoresponsive and bioorthogonal nucleic acid circuits.

         <dc:description>
Bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. The SSLMBs with the CSEs show high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability.

Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising to accelerate commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Nonetheless, this is hindered by the CSEs&#8217; limited ion conductivity at room temperature. Here, we propose design, synthesis, and application of the bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers for PEO&#8208;based CSEs. The neuron&#8208;like superhydrophobic nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. Compared to various reported fillers, the nanofillers can greatly improve ionic conductivity (4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, 30&#8201;&#176;C), Li+ transference number (0.63), oxidation stability (5.3&#8197;V) and mechanical properties of the PEO&#8208;based CSEs because of the following facts. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. Consequently, the assembled SSLMBs with the CSEs and LiFePO4 or NCM811 cathodes display superior cycling stability over a wide temperature range of 50&#8201;&#176;C to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Surprisingly, the pouch batteries with the large&#8208;scale prepared CSEs kept working after being repeatedly bent, folded, cut or even punched in air. We believe that design of neuron&#8208;like nanofillers is a viable approach to produce CSEs with high room temperature ionic conductivity for SSLMBs.

         <title>Pyridazine&#8208;Promoted Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Exceptional Capability of Stepwise Water Harvesting</title>

Two COFs with non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages were successfully constructed using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine in Knoevenagel condensation, with high crystallinity, large surface areas, and finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;channels decorated with substantial cis&#8208;azo moieties, which exhibited exceptionally stepwise water uptake capacity.







Abstract
In this study, we successfully developed two novel vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine through Knoevenagel condensation. These COFs featured finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;scale pore sizes, high surface areas and stable non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages. Finely resolved powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns demonstrated highly crystalline structures with a hexagonal lattice in the AA layer stacking. The resulting one&#8208;dimensional channels possess strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting sites arising from the decorated cis&#8208;azo/azine units with two pairs of fully exposed lone pair electrons, endowing the as&#8208;prepared COFs with exceptional water absorption properties. The g&#8208;DZPH&#8208;COF exhibited successive steep water uptake steps starting from low relative pressures (P/PSTA=0.1), with the remarkable water uptake capacity of 0.26&#8197;g/g at P/PSTA=0.2 (25&#8201;&#176;C), which is the optimal value recorded among the reported COFs. Dynamic vapour sorption measurements revealed the fast kinetics of these COFs, even in the cluster formation process. Water uptake and release cycling tests demonstrated their outstanding hydrolytic stability, durability, and adsorption&#8211;desorption retention ability.

         <title>Rational Understanding Hydroxide Diffusion Mechanism in Anion Exchange Membranes during Electrochemical Processes with RDAnalyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to analyze and decouple hydroxide diffusion mechanism in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) during electrochemical processes. Our simulations show that the majority of hydroxides follow the associated Grotthuss diffusion mechanism in the model system.







Abstract
Enhancing the understanding of hydroxide transport mechanisms in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is beneficial for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs in the renewable energy system. However, the high complexity and lack of adequate analytic tools make it challenging to clarify different mechanisms unambiguously. Herein, we developed an in&#8208;house toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to conduct an effective analysis of hydroxide diffusion mechanisms from ReaxFF molecular dynamic simulations. Using the experimentally well&#8208;synthesized T20NC6NC5N as a model system, we successfully decoupled the hydroxide diffusion mechanisms into free Vehicular and free Grotthuss, as well as associated Vehicular and associated Grotthuss, which was not yet achieved previously. Meanwhile, RDAnalyzer managed to specifically identify the drift length of hydroxide species for each mechanism under the electric field, which worked as a useful variable for calculating the conductivity of AEMs. Our theoretically predicted conductivity for T20NC6NC5N agrees reasonably with experimental results, indicating the reliability of RDAnalyzer. This work not only provides a rational understanding of the complex hydroxide diffusion mechanisms in AEMs but also holds the potential to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs with computations.

         <title>Transient Structural Properties of the Rho GDP&#8208;Dissociation Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex formation between GTPases and their partially disordered nucleotide dissociation inhibitors has been assumed to rely on folding upon binding. Here, Medina Gomez et&#8197;al. show that instead, pertinent structural features are equally representative, both in apo inhibitor and the complex, as transient structural properties, which revises the mechanisms of membrane extraction.







Abstract
Rho GTPases, master spatial regulators of a wide range of cellular processes, are orchestrated by complex formation with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs). These have been thought to possess an unstructured N&#8208;terminus that inhibits nucleotide exchange of their client upon binding/folding. Via NMR analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays, we reveal instead pertinent structural properties transiently maintained both, in the presence and absence of the client, imposed onto the terminus context&#8208;specifically by modulating interactions with the surface of the folded C&#8208;terminal domain. These observations revise the long&#8208;standing textbook picture of the GTPases&#8217; mechanism of membrane extraction. Rather than by a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition upon binding of an inhibitory peptide, the intricate and highly selective extraction process of RhoGTPases is orchestrated via a dynamic ensemble bearing preformed transient structural properties, suitably modulated by the specific surrounding along the multi&#8208;step process.

         <title>Identification and Characterization of Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent Lyases with an Unusual CDG Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical sequence GDG(X)24&#8208;27N, is the fingerprint of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We have characterized a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE) with an unusual cysteine replacing the first glycine of this motif. We unravel an unexpected function for the atypical cysteine and establish JanthE for valuable biocatalytic applications and as a model for mechanistic studies.







Abstract
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical GDG(X)24&#8208;27N sequence, is highly conserved among ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We investigated a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE from Janthinobacterium sp. HH01) with an unusual cysteine (C458) replacing the first glycine of this motif. JanthE exhibits a high substrate promiscuity and accepts long aliphatic &#945;&#8208;keto acids as donors. Sterically hindered aromatic aldehydes or non&#8208;activated ketones are acceptor substrates, giving access to a variety of secondary and tertiary alcohols as carboligation products. The crystal structure solved at a resolution of 1.9&#8197;&#197; reveals that C458 is not primarily involved in cofactor binding as previously thought for the canonical glycine. Instead, it coordinates methionine 406, thus ensuring the integrity of the active site and the enzyme activity. In addition, we have determined the long&#8208;sought genuine tetrahedral intermediates formed with pyruvate and 2&#8208;oxobutyrate in the pre&#8208;decarboxylation states and deciphered the atomic details for their stabilization in the active site. Collectively, we unravel an unexpected role for the first residue of the ThDP&#8208;binding motif and unlock a family of lyases that can perform valuable carboligation reactions.

In addition, we have determined the long-sought genuine tetrahedral intermediates formed with pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate in the pre-decarboxylation states and deciphered the atomic details for their stabilization in the active site. Collectively, we unravel an unexpected role for the first residue of the ThDP-binding motif and unlock a family of lyases that can perform valuable carboligation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light and Guest Responsive Behavior in a Porous Coordination Network Enabled by Reversible [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a light and guest responsive physisorbent which exhibited gas&#8208;induced nonporous to porous switching and [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV irradiation or sunlight. The phase transformations were enabled by flexible olefinic linker ligands and occurred in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion (2D sql to 3D mot topology). Activated variants exhibited different stepped isotherm profiles when exposed to CO2 at 195&#8197;K.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents that undergo reversible structural transformations induced by external stimuli (e.g. light, guests, or heat) offer the promise of utility in gas storage and separation. Whereas reports on guest or light&#8208;responsive sorbents have increased in recent years, we are unaware of reports on sorbents that exhibit both light and guest&#8208;induced structural transformations. Herein, we report that the square lattice, sql, topology coordination network Zn(fba)(bis)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMF (sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945;, 5=trans&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)stilbene=bis, 6=2,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane=H2fba) underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation (SCSC) upon activation, affording nonporous sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946;. Parallel alignment at 3.23&#8197;&#197; of olefinic moieties on adjacent bis ligands in sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945; enabled SCSC [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV light (365&#8197;nm) or sunlight. sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945; thereby transformed to mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945;, which was subsequently activated to the narrow pore phase mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946;. sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; and mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; both exhibited S&#8208;shaped adsorption isotherms characteristic of guest&#8208;induced structural changes when exposed to CO2 at 195&#8197;K (type&#8208;F&#8211;IV and type&#8197;F&#8211;I, respectively). Cycling experiments conducted upon sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; reduced particle size after cycle 1 and induced transformation into a rare example of a shape memory coordination network, sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#947;. Insight into this smorgasbord of SCSC phase changes was gained from in situ PXRD, single crystal XRD and 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of the Structural Analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 in the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 establish a solid foundation for designing highly efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts and offer new insights into the mechanism of CO2 activity at the atomic level.







Abstract
Owing to the significant attention directed toward alloy metal nanoclusters, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their structures and their performance during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and discover potential synergistic effects for the design of novel functional nanoclusters. However, a lack of suitable analogs makes this investigation challenging. In this study, we synthesized a well&#8208;defined pair of structural analogs, [Au8Cu1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ and [Au8Ag1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ (Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1, respectively), and characterized them. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au8M1 (M=Cu/Ag) consists of a tetrahedral Au3M1 core capped by three (Dppm)Au staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, one lone SR ligand, and a terminal Cl ligand. Ag and Cu were doped at the same site in the Au8M1 nanoclusters, which has rarely been reported. Au8Cu1 exhibited a significantly higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO; ~82.2&#8201;%) during eCO2RR than that of Au8Ag1 (FECO; ~33.1&#8201;%). Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that *COOH is the key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The formation of *COOH on Au8Cu1 is more thermodynamically stable than on Au8Ag1, and Au8Cu1 shows a smaller *CO formation energy than that on Au8Ag1, which promotes the reduction of CO2. We believe that the structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 offer a suitable template for the in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;property correlations at the atomic level.

         <title>Catalytic Refining Lignin&#8208;Derived Monomers: Seesaw Effect between Nanoparticle and Single&#8208;Atom Pt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seesaw effect between Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles in the catalytic refining of lignin monomers, viz. demethoxylation on a single&#8208;atom catalyst versus deep deoxygenation on a nanoparticle, is disclosed. The weak hydrogen spillover behavior on SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H inhibits hydrogenation of the benzene ring and removal of the phenol hydroxyl group, presenting in a high demethoxylation selectivity.







Abstract
Pt automatically adsorbed on oxygen vacancy of TiO2 via an in situ interfacial redox reaction, resulting in atomically dispersion of Pt on TiO2. In the upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived 4&#8208;propylguaiacol, single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) Pt/TiO2&#8722;H achieved a conversion of 96.9&#8201;% and a demethoxylation selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% under 3&#8197;MPa H2 at 250&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, markedly different from the performance of nanoparticle counterpart that gave deep deoxygenation selectivity over 99.0&#8201;%. The high demethoxylation activity of SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H is mainly attributed to its weak hydrogen spillover capacity that suppressed the benzene ring hydrogenation and the deep deoxygenation. Additionally, SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H reduced the energy barrier of CAr&#8722;OCH3 bond cleavage and accordingly lowered the Gibbs free energy of the demethoxylation reaction. This facile method could fabricate single&#8208;atom Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru supported on TiO2&#8722;H, demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the establishment of a library of SACs. Moreover, SAC exhibited versatile capacity in demethoxylation of different lignin&#8208;derived monomers and high stability. This study showcases the superiority of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for selective demethoxylation reactions and proposes a renewable alternative to fossil&#8208;based 4&#8208;alkylphenols through upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived monomers.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Mixed Plastics of Polyester and CO2&#8208;Based Polycarbonate to a Single Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lactone/epoxide bifunctional monomer is polymerized orthogonally to polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate which, including their mixture (physical blend), can be depolymerized back to the same, single monomer with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity, realizing the closed&#8208;loop recycling of a mixture of plastics.







Abstract
Physical blending is an effective strategy for tailoring polymeric materials to specific application requirements. However, physically blended mixed plastics waste adds additional barriers in mechanical or chemical recycling. This difficulty arises from the intricate requirement for meticulous sorting and separation of the various polymers in the inherent incompatibility of mixed polymers during recycling. To overcome this impediment, this work furthers the emerging single&#8208;monomer &#8211; multiple&#8208;materials approach through the design of a bifunctional monomer that can not only orthogonally polymerize into two different types of polymers &#8211; specifically lactone&#8208;based polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate &#8211; but the resultant polymers and their mixture can also be depolymerized back to the single, original monomer when facilitated by catalysis. Specifically, the lactone/epoxide hybrid bifunctional monomer (BiLO) undergoes ring&#8208;opening polymerization through the lactone manifold to produce polyester, PE(BiLO), and is also applied to ring&#8208;opening copolymerization with CO2, via the epoxide manifold, to yield polycarbonate, PC(BiLO). Remarkably, a one&#8208;pot recycling process of a BiLO&#8208;derived PE/PC blend back to the constituent monomer BiLO in &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity was achieved with a superbase catalyst at 150&#8201;&#176;C, thereby effectively obviating the requirement for sorting and separation typically required for recycling of mixed polymers.

         <title>Ion Current Rectification Activity Induced by Boron Hydride Nanosheets to Enhance Magnesium Analgesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic MgB2 nanoparticles are found with potent analgesia, surpassing the efficacy of the clinical MgSO4 and morphine. In pathological environments, MgB2 undergoes hydrolysis, forming borohydride (BH). BH characterized by semimetallic properties and delocalized pi electrons, can alter the behaviors of Na+ and K+ around neurons via pi&#8208;cation interactions, significantly enhancing the magnesium analgesia.







Abstract
The limited analgesic efficiency of magnesium restricts its application in pain management. Here, we report boron hydride (BH) with ion currents rectification activity that can enhance the analgesic efficiency of magnesium without the risks of drug tolerance or addiction. We synthesize MgB2, comprising hexagonal boron sheets alternating with Mg2+. In pathological environment, Mg2+ is exchanged by H+, forming two&#8208;dimensional borophene&#8208;analogue BH sheets. BH interacts with the charged cations via cation&#8208;pi interaction, leading to dynamic modulation of sodium and potassium ion currents around neurons. Additionally, released Mg2+ competes Ca2+ to inhibit its influx and neuronal excitation. In vitro cultured dorsal root neurons show a remarkable increase in threshold potential from the normal &#8722;35.9&#8197;mV to &#8722;5.9&#8197;mV after the addition of MgB2, indicating potent analgesic effect. In three typical pain models, including CFA&#8208;induced inflammatory pain, CINP&#8208; or CCI&#8208;induced neuropathic pain, MgB2 exhibits analgesic efficiency approximately 2.23, 3.20, and 2.0&#8197;times higher than clinical MgSO4, respectively, and even about 1.04, 1.66, and 1.95&#8197;times higher than morphine, respectively. The development of magnesium based intermetallic compounds holds promise in addressing the non&#8208;opioid medical need for pain relief.

         <title>Multiple Stabilization Effects of Benzylhydrazine on Scalable Perovskite Precursor Inks for Improved Perovskite Solar Cell Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of stabilizing perovskite ink is proposed. This method uses benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) to stabilize the organic cations of perovskite ink, and remove harmful water impurities, while also reducing iodine back to iodide as has already been discovered. The downstream products of BHC and iodine are investigated via 1D and 2D&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and found to be chemically benign. All scalable perovskite solar cells are made with BHC ink and found to have nearly 20&#8201;% efficiency.







Abstract
Perovskite precursor inks suffer various forms of degradation, such as iodide anion oxidation and organic cation breakdown, hindering reliable perovskite solar cell manufacturing. Here we report that benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) not only retards the buildup of iodine as previously reported but also prevents the breakdown of organic cations. Through investigating BHC and iodine chemical reactions, we elucidate protonation and dehydration mechanisms, converting BHC to harmless volatile compounds, thus preserving perovskite film crystallization and solar cell performance. This inhibition effect lasts nearly a month with minimal BHC, contrasting control inks without BHC where organic cations fully react in less than a week. This enhanced understanding, from additive stabilization to end products, promises improved perovskite solar cell production reliability.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Analysis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic synthesis has been successfully performed producing the longest homogeneous chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycopeptides to date. Compared to more traditional chemical synthesis, this new strategy was much more efficient, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The availability of well&#8208;defined CS glycopeptides enabled the study of the impacts of sulfation on glycopeptide structures and functions.







Abstract
Proteoglycans (PGs), consisting of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked with the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, play roles in many important biological events. The chemical synthesis of PG glycopeptides is extremely challenging. In this work, the enzymes required for synthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS) PG (CSPG) have been expressed and the suitable sequence of enzymatic reactions has been established. To expedite CSPG synthesis, the peptide acceptor was immobilized on solid phase and the glycan units were directly installed enzymatically onto the peptide. Subsequent enzymatic chain elongation and sulfation led to the successful synthesis of CSPG glycopeptides. The CS dodecasaccharide glycopeptide was the longest homogeneous CS glycopeptide synthesized to date. The enzymatic synthesis was much more efficient than the chemical synthesis of the corresponding CS glycopeptides, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The structures of the CS glycopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis and NMR studies. In addition, the interactions between the CS glycopeptides and cathepsin G were studied. The sulfation of glycan chain was found to be important for binding with cathepsin G. This efficient chemoenzymatic strategy opens new avenues to investigate the structures and functions of PGs.

With the introduction of dibenzothiophene into poly(aryl piperidinium) membrane, the sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks can efficiently transport the OH&#8722; ions through continuous OH&#8722; ions conducting highways, leading to significant improvement of anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is widely regarded as the next&#8208;generation technology for producing green hydrogen. The OH&#8722; conductivity of the anion exchange membrane plays a key role in the practical implementation of this device. Here, we present a series of Z&#8722;S&#8208;x membranes with dibenzothiophene groups. These membranes contain sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks that link surrounding surface site hopping regions, forming continuous OH&#8722; conducting highways. Z&#8722;S&#8208;20 has a high through&#8208;plane OH&#8722; conductivity of 182&#177;28&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and ultralong stability of 2650&#8197;h in KOH solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM&#8208;free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#8197;V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650&#8197;h at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65&#8197;mV/h.

         <title>Broad Protection against Invasive Fungal Disease from a Nanobody Targeting the Active Site of Fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;Glucanosyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>

Nanobodies show promise in treating invasive fungal diseases such as aspergillosis and cryptococcosis. By selectively targeting enzymes critical for fungal cell wall remodeling, these single&#8208;domain antibodies significantly enhanced survival rates in animal models. This approach opens up a promising new pathway for the development of antifungal therapies, potentially improving outcomes for immunocompromised patients.







Abstract
Invasive fungal disease accounts for about 3.8&#8197;million deaths annually, an unacceptable rate that urgently prompts the discovery of new knowledge&#8208;driven treatments. We report the use of camelid single&#8208;domain nanobodies (Nbs) against fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucanosyltransferases (Gel) involved in &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan transglycosylation. Crystal structures of two Nbs with Gel4 from Aspergillus fumigatus revealed binding to a dissimilar CBM43 domain and a highly conserved catalytic domain across fungal species, respectively. Anti&#8208;Gel4 active site Nb3 showed significant antifungal efficacy in vitro and in vivo prophylactically and therapeutically against different A. fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, reducing the fungal burden and disease severity, thus significantly improving immunocompromised animal survival. Notably, C. deneoformans (serotype&#8197;D) strains were more susceptible to Nb3 and genetic Gel deletion than C. neoformans (serotype A) strains, indicating a key role for &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan remodelling in C. deneoformans survival. These findings add new insight about the role of &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan in fungal biology and demonstrate the potential of nanobodies in targeting fungal enzymes to combat invasive fungal diseases.

         <title>Enhancement of Overall Kinetics by Se&#8722;Br Chemistry in Rechargeable Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a multifunctional electrolyte additive PhSeBr has been successfully applied to Li&#8722;S batteries, which can exert synergistic influence on the electrodes and electrolyte, thus improving the kinetic behavior of lithium ion and reducing the high energy barrier of the solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur. The Li&#8722;S cell modified by PhSeBr displays the superior stability in both coin and pouch cells with the extreme conditions of high S loadings and low temperature.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries severely impedes the application in extreme conditions. Bridging the sulfur cathode and lithium anode, the electrolyte plays a crucial role in regulating kinetic behaviors of Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, we report a multifunctional electrolyte additive of phenyl selenium bromide (PhSeBr) to simultaneously exert positive influences on both electrodes and the electrolyte. For the cathode, an ideal conversion routine with lower energy barrier can be attained by the redox mediator and homogeneous catalyst derived from PhSeBr, thus improving the reaction kinetics and utilization of sulfur. Meanwhile, the presence of Se&#8722;Br bond helps to reconstruct a loose solvation sheath of lithium ions and a robust bilayer SEI with excellent ionic conductivity, which contributes to reducing the de&#8208;solvation energy and simultaneously enhancing the interfacial kinetics. The Li&#8722;S battery with PhSeBr displays superior long cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 1164.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C rate. And the pouch cell exhibits a maximum capacity of 845.3&#8197;mAh and a capacity retention of 94.8&#8201;% after 50&#8197;cycles. Excellent electrochemical properties are also obtained in extreme conditions of high sulfur loadings and low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work demonstrates the versatility and practicability of the special additive, striking out an efficient but simple method to design advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Hierarchical Solid&#8208;Additive Strategy for Achieving Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells with Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells, we use FeCl3 as a p&#8208;type dopant to enhance the hole mobility and hole concentration of the lower donor layer and polyfluorene as a wide&#8208;band gap polymer additive into the upper acceptor layer to improve the morphology and prolong exciton lifetime without affecting the open&#8208;circuit voltage. Such a hierarchical strategy achieves higher and more balanced charge mobilities and suppresses charge recombination.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition of active layers in organic solar cells (OSCs) offers immense potential for optimizing performance through precise tailoring of each layer. However, achieving high&#8208;performance LbL OSCs with distinct solid additives in each layer remains challenging. In this study, we explore a novel approach that strategically incorporates different solid additives into specific layers of LbL devices. To this end, we introduce FeCl3 into the lower donor (D18) layer as a p&#8208;type dopant to enhance hole concentration and mobility. Concurrently, we incorporate the wide&#8208;band gap conjugated polymer poly(9,9&#8208;di&#8208;n&#8208;octylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl) (PFO) into the upper acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) layer to improve the morphology and prolong exciton lifetime. Unlike previous studies, our approach combines these two strategies to achieve higher and more balanced electron and hole mobility without affecting device open&#8208;circuit voltage, while also suppressing charge recombination. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO device increases to 18.12&#8201;%, while the D18/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device attains a PCE of 18.79&#8201;%. These values represent substantial improvements over the control device&#8242;s PCE of 17.59&#8201;%. Notably, when both FeCl3 and PFO are incorporated, the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.17&#8201;%. In summary, our research results demonstrate the effectiveness of the layered solid additive strategy in improving OSC performance.

         <title>Modifying Proton Relay into Bioinspired Dye&#8208;Based Coordination Polymer for Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural PCET enzymes, proton&#8208;relay containing dye&#8208;based coordination polymer, H+@In&#8722;AQ, was constructed as potent photocatalytic PCET mediator for both oxidative and reductive PCET, exhibiting the elevated reactivities and special selectivity in photocatalytic PCET&#8208;activation of inert bonds to furnish the conversions with pharmaceutical interests. @ZhangTiexin







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) imparts an energetic advantage over single electron transfer in activating inert substances. Natural PCET enzyme catalysis generally requires tripartite preorganization of proton relay, substrate&#8208;bound active center, and redox mediator, making the processes efficient and precluding side reactions. Inspired by this, a heterogeneous photocatalytic PCET system was established to achieve higher PCET driving forces by modifying proton relays into anthraquinone&#8208;based anionic coordination polymers. The proximally separated proton relays and photoredox&#8208;mediating anthraquinone moiety allowed pre&#8208;assembly of inert substrate between them, merging proton and electron into unsaturated bonds by photoreductive PCET, which enhanced reaction kinetics compared with the counter catalyst without proton relay. This photocatalytic PCET method was applied to a broad&#8208;scoped reduction of aryl ketones, unsaturated carbonyls, and aromatic compounds. The distinctive regioselectivities for the reduction of isoquinoline derivatives were found to occur on the carbon&#8208;ring sides. PCET&#8208;generated radical intermediate of quinoline could be trapped by alkene for proton relay&#8208;assisted Minisci addition, forming the pharmaceutical aza&#8208;acenaphthene scaffold within one step. When using heteroatom(X)&#8722;H/C&#8722;H compounds as proton&#8208;electron donors, this protocol could activate these inert bonds through photooxidative PCET to afford radicals and trap them by electron&#8208;deficient unsaturated compounds, furnishing the direct X&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>Lithium Hydride in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries as a Pulverization Accelerator of Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pulverization&#8208;related electrochemical degradation of the silicon anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is closely associated with the presence of LiH in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). During the de&#8208;lithiation process of the silicon&#8208;based anode, the reverse lithiation of LiH on micron&#8208;sized silicon particles significantly increases the localized stress within the particles, accelerating particle pulverization.







Abstract
As a highly promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;specific capacity anode, the industrial&#8208;scale utilization of micron silicon has been hindered by the issue of pulverization during cycling. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of regulating the inorganic components of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in improving pulverization, the evolution of most key inorganic components in the SEI and their correlation with silicon failure mechanisms remain ambiguous. This study provides a clear and direct correlation between the lithium hydride (LiH) in the SEI and the degree of micron silicon pulverization in the battery system. The reverse lithiation behavior of LiH on micron silicon during de&#8208;lithiation exacerbates the localized stress in silicon particles and contributes to particle pulverization. This work successfully proposes a novel approach to decouple the SEI from electrochemical performance, which can be significant to decipher the evolution of critical SEI components at varied battery anode interfaces and analyze their corresponding failure mechanisms.

         <title>Strong Acid Enabled Comprehensive Training of Poly (Sodium Acrylate) Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, general, and reversible training strategy assisted by strong&#8208;acids with two&#8208;steps is proposed to enable comprehensive improvement of the poly (sodium acrylate) network&#8208;based hydrogels by constructing dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, as well as show significantly mechanical improvement in Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture stress.







Abstract
The design of admirable hydrogel networks is of both practical and fundamental importance for diverse applications of hydrogels. Herein a general strategy of acid&#8208;assisted training is designed to enable multiple improvements of conventional poly (sodium acrylate) networks for hydrogels. Hydrophobic homogeneous crosslinked poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels are prepared to verify the strategy. The multiple improvements of poly (sodium acrylate) networks are simply achieved by immersing the hydrogel networks into 4&#8197;M H2SO4 solutions. The introduced acids would induce transformation of poly (sodium acrylate) into poly (acrylic acid) at hydrogel surface, which constructs dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions to tighten the network. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, and show mechanical improvement. The internal poly (sodium acrylate) of the pristine acid&#8208;containing hydrogels is further fully transformed via acid&#8208;infiltration after following cyclic stretch/release training to significantly improve the mechanical performance. The Young's modulus, stress, and toughness of the fully&#8208;trained hydrogels are 187.6&#8197;times, 35.6&#8197;times, and 5.4&#8197;times enhanced, respectively. The polymeric networks retain isotropic in fully&#8208;trained hydrogels to ensure superior stretchability of 8.6. The acid&#8208;assisted training performance of the hydrogels can be reversibly recovered by NaOH neutralization. The acid&#8208;assisted training strategy here is general for poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels.

         <title>Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cylindrical molecule with D3&#8208;symmetry was found to serve as versatile vertices to form 2&#8208;dimensional, honeycomb networks of host&#8211;guest complexes. Varying the structural elements of the layered systems enabled a wide range of structural combinations to become accessible.







Abstract
Studies of graphene show that robust chemical bonds such as covalent bonds with trigonal&#8208;planar atoms afford layered atomic 2D crystals possessing unique properties. Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one&#8208;off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a D3&#8208;symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8211;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, the stereochemistry of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Prediction&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Thiophosphates as Promising Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the guidance of theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric alkali and alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates ACaPS4 have been synthesized successfully. Comprehensive characterizations indicate that the ACaPS4 family could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, considering the wide band gap, moderate birefringence, high LIDT, and phase&#8208;matching large SHG response.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of functional materials is a focus of attention in material science. As one of the most important function materials, infrared nonlinear optical materials with large second harmonic generation effects and broad optical band gap are in urgent need. In this work, directed by the theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) alkali&#8208;alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates LiCaPS4 (Ama2), NaCaPS4 (P21), KCaPS4 (Pna21), RbCaPS4 (Pna21), CsCaPS4 (Pna21) were successfully synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that ACaPS4 could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, exhibiting wide band gap (3.77&#8211;3.86&#8197;eV), moderate birefringence (0.027&#8211;0.064 at 1064&#8197;nm), high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT, ~10&#215;AGS), and suitable phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation responses (0.4&#8211;0.6&#215;AGS). Structure&#8208;properties analyses illustrate that the Ca&#8722;S bonds show non&#8208;ignorable covalent feature, and [PS4] together with [CaSn] units play dominant roles to determine the band gap and SHG response. This work indicates that Li&#8208;, Na&#8208; and K&#8208; analogs may be promising infrared nonlinear optical material candidates, and this is the first successful case of &#8220;prediction to synthesis&#8221; involving infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals in the thiophosphate system and may provide a new avenue to the design and oriented synthesis of high&#8208;performance function materials in the future.

&lt;p&gt;By the guidance of theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non-centrosymmetric alkali and alkaline earth metal [PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]-based thiophosphates ACaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have been synthesized successfully. Comprehensive characterizations indicate that the ACaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; family could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, considering the wide band gap, moderate birefringence, high LIDT, and phase-matching large SHG response.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oriented synthesis of functional materials is a focus of attention in material science. As one of the most important function materials, infrared nonlinear optical materials with large second harmonic generation effects and broad optical band gap are in urgent need. In this work, directed by the theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non-centrosymmetric (NCS) alkali-alkaline earth metal [PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]-based thiophosphates LiCaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt;2), NaCaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), KCaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pna&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), RbCaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pna&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), CsCaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pna&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) were successfully synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that ACaPS4 could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, exhibiting wide band gap (3.77&#8211;3.86&#8197;eV), moderate birefringence (0.027&#8211;0.064 at 1064&#8197;nm), high laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT, ~10&#215;AGS), and suitable phase-matching second harmonic generation responses (0.4&#8211;0.6&#215;AGS). Structure-properties analyses illustrate that the Ca&#8722;S bonds show non-ignorable covalent feature, and [PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] together with [CaS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;] units play dominant roles to determine the band gap and SHG response. This work indicates that Li-, Na- and K- analogs may be promising infrared nonlinear optical material candidates, and this is the first successful case of &#8220;prediction to synthesis&#8221; involving infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals in the thiophosphate system and may provide a new avenue to the design and oriented synthesis of high-performance function materials in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi&#8208;Pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by copper peptides in human plasma, we designed a ferrocene&#8208;capped self&#8208;assembling peptide, FcGH. It can self&#8208;assemble through two different pathways: spontaneous self&#8208;assembly and Cu2+&#8208;induced. By controlling the amount of Cu2+ added, these pathways can form adjustable assembly morphologies and generate different biological effects.







Abstract
Although self&#8208;assembly has emerged as an effective tool for fabricating biomaterials, achieving precise control over the morphologies and functionalities of the resultant assemblies remains an ongoing challenge. Inspired by the copper peptide naturally present in human plasma, in this study, we designed a synthetic precursor, FcGH. FcGH can self&#8208;assemble via two distinct pathways: spontaneous and Cu2+&#8208;induced. These two assembly pathways enabled the formation of assemblies with tunable morphologies by adjusting the amount of added Cu2+. We found that the nanoparticles formed by Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency than the wormlike fibers formed spontaneously. Moreover, this Cu2+&#8208;induced assembly process occurred spontaneously at a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Cu2+ to FcGH, avoiding the excessive use of Cu2+ and a tedious preparation procedure. By co&#8208;assembling with 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)&#8208;conjugated FcGH, Cu2+&#8208;induced supramolecular nanodrugs elicited multiple cell death modalities in cancer cells with elevated immunogenicity, enhancing the therapeutic effect compared to free HCPT. This study highlights Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly as an efficient tool for directing the assembly of nanodrugs and for synergistic tumor therapy.

         <title>New Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Layered Double Perovskite Halides: Synthesis, Structural Transition and Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs) have been synthesized by variations of trivalent metal centers in the inorganic layer as well as modifications in the organic spacers. All the HLDPs display ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (kL) with notable anisotropy in&#160;kL&#160;observed for RP&#8208;HLDP (3N&#8208;CuIn) when&#160;measured parallel and perpendicular&#160;to layer stacking.







Abstract
Hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs), representing the two&#8208;dimensional manifestation of halide double perovskites, have elicited considerable interest owing to their intricate chemical bonding hierarchy and structural diversity. This intensified interest stems from the diverse options available for selecting alternating octahedral coordinated trivalent [M(III)] and monovalent metal centers [M(I)], along with the distinctive nature of the cationic organic amine located between the layers. Here, we have synthesized three new compounds with general formula (R&#8242;/R&#8242;&#8242;)4/2M(III)M(I)Cl8; where R&#8242;=C3H7NH3 (i.e. 3N) and R&#8242;&#8242;=NH3C4H8NH3 (i.e. 4N4); M(III)=In3+ or Ru3+; M(I)=Cu+ by simple solution&#8208;based acid precipitation method. The structural analysis reveals that (4N4)2CuInCl8 and (4N4)2CuRuCl8 adopt the layered Dion Jacobson (DJ) structure, whereas (3N)4CuInCl8 exhibits layered Ruddlesden Popper (RP) structure. The alternative octahedra within the inorganic layer display distortions and tilting. Three compounds show temperature&#8208;dependent structural phase transitions where changes in the staking of inorganic layer, extent of octahedral tilting and reorientation of organic spacers with temperature have been noticed. We have achieved ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) in the HLDPs in the 2 to 300&#8197;K range, marking a distinctive feature within the realm of HLDP systems. The RP&#8208;HLDP compound, (3N)4CuInCl8, demonstrates anisotropy in &#954;L while measured parallel and perpendicular to layer stacking, showcasing ultralow &#954;L of 0.15 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is one of the lowest values obtained among Pb&#8208;free metal halide perovskite. The observed ultralow &#954;L in three new HLDPs is attributed to significant lattice anharmonicity arising from the chemical bonding heterogeneity and soft crystal structure, which resulted in low&#8208;energy localized optical phonon modes that suppress heat&#8208;carrying acoustic phonons.

         <title>Directional Growth and Density Modulation of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic adsorption synergistically modulates the density of CeO2&#8722;X particles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) ultimately enabling directional growth and localized density modulation of single&#8208;atom platinum (PtSA). Localized density control of PtSA via tuning the density of H* radicals can improve the electrocatalytic performance of all pH conditions in hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Dispersion of single atoms (SAs) in the host is important for optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to tune oxygen vacancies in CeO2&#8722;X directionally anchoring the single atom platinum (PtSA), which is uniformly dispersed on the rGO. The catalyst's performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be enhanced by controlling different densities of CeO2&#8208;X in rGO. The PtSA performs best optimally densified and loaded on homogeneous and moderately densified CeO2&#8208;X/rGO (PtSA&#8722;M&#8722;CeO2&#8722;X/rGO). It exhibited higher activity in HER with an overpotential of 25&#8197;mV at 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 33&#8197;mV at 1 KOH than that of almost reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, it exhibited stability for 90&#8197;hours at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1 KOH and &#8722;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 conditions, respectively. Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the suitable dispersion density of PtSA on the defects of CeO2&#8722;X with more active sites gives the potential for practical applications. This research paves the way for developing single&#8208;atom catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and stability, holding promise in advanced green energy conversion through defects engineering.

         <title>Structurally Modulated Formation of Cyanine J&#8208;Aggregates with Sharp and Tunable Spectra for Multiplexed Optoacoustic and Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands are attained by introducing a branched structure with a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of heptamethine cyanine dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. J&#8208;aggregates with their absorption band in NIR&#8208;II region are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging on animal models.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregation brings intriguing optical and electronic properties to molecular dyes and significantly expands their applicability across diverse domains, yet the challenge for rationally designing J&#8208;aggregating dyes persists. Herein, we developed a large number of J&#8208;aggregating dyes from scratch by progressively refining structure of a common heptamethine cyanine. J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum&#8804;38&#8197;nm) are attained by introducing a branched structure featuring a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. Analysis of single crystal data of nine dyes reveals a correlation between J&#8208;aggregation propensity and molecular arrangement within crystals. Some J&#8208;aggregates are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging in animals. Notably, three&#8208;color multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution is achieved, owing to the sharp and distinct absorption bands of the J&#8208;aggregates.

         <title>Utilizing the Perfluoronaphthalene Radical Cation as a Selective Deelectronator to Access a Variety of Strongly Oxidizing Reactive Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron Theft: Upon removal of an electron, perfluoronaphthalene turns to the selective and powerful deelectronator radical cation [naphthaleneF]+., with a potential of +2.00 (solution)/+2.41&#8197;V (solid&#8208;state) vs. Fc+/0. Its broad applicability, power, and selectivity are demonstrated by the reaction with a series of exemplarily chosen organ(ometall)ic molecules and elements.







Abstract
A selective deelectronation reagent with very high potential of +2.00 (solution)/+2.41&#8197;V (solid&#8208;state) vs. Fc+/0 and based on a room temperature stable perfluoronaphthalene (naphthaleneF) radical cation salt was developed and applied. The solid&#8208;state deelectronation of commercial naphthaleneF with [NO]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; generates [naphthaleneF]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=OC(CF3)3) in gram scale. Thermochemical analysis unravels the solid&#8208;state deelectronation potential of the starting [NO]+&#8208;reagent to be +2.34&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 with [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; counterion, but only +1.14&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 with the small [SbF6]&#8722; ion. Selective reactions demonstrate the selectivity of [naphthaleneF]+&#8901; for deelectronation of a multitude of organ(ometall)ic molecules and elements in solution: providing the molecular structures of the acene dications [tetracene]2+, [pentacene]2+ or spectroscopic evidence for the carbonyl complex of the ferrocene dication [Fc(CO)]2+, the [P9]+ cation from white phosphorus, the solvent&#8208;free copper(I) salt starting from copper metal and the dicationic Fe(IV)&#8208;scorpionate complex [Fe(sc)2]2+.

         <title>Efficient Capture and Low Energy Release of NH3 by Azophenol Decorated Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new UV/Vis photoresponsive covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;HNU38, was designed and synthesized by chemical integration of light&#8208;responsive azophenol units into the pore wall of an imine type COF as both light switch and NH3 adsorption sites. It was found that the COF exhibited efficient capture and low&#8208;energy release of NH3, and about 29.0&#8201;% of the adsorbed NH3 could be removed by vis&#8208;light irradiated cis&#8208;trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, while the remaining NH3 might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum.







Abstract
In NH3 capture technologies, the desorption process is usually driven by high temperature and low pressure (such as 150&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum), which accounts for intensive energy consumption and CO2 emission. Developing light responsive adsorbent is promising in this regard but remains a great challenge. Here, we for the first time designed and synthesized a light responsive azophenol&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF), COF&#8208;HNU38, to address this challenge. We found that at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1.0&#8197;bar, the cis &#8208;COF exhibited a NH3 uptake capacity of 7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a NH3/N2 selectivity of 158. In the adsorbed NH3, about 29.0&#8201;% could be removed by vis&#8208;light irradiated cis&#8208;trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the remaining NH3 might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. Almost no decrease in adsorption capacity was observed after eight adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. As such, an efficient NH3 capture and low energy release strategy was established thanks to the multiple hydrogen bond interactions (which are strong in total but weak in individuals) between NH3 and the smart COF, as well as the increased polarity and number of hydrogen bond sites after the trans&#8208;cis isomerization.

         <title>Intrinsically Decoupled Coordination Chemistries Enable Quasi&#8208;Eutectic Electrolytes with Fast Kinetics toward Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal theory of intrinsically decoupling is proposed to conquer the sluggish kinetics in eutectic electrolytes, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte that enables ZICs with high reversibility and elevated capacitance output.







Abstract
Eutectic electrolytes show potential beyond conventional low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) in zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) yet suffer from high viscosity and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we originally propose a universal theory of intrinsically decoupling to address these issues, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte (quasi&#8208;EE). Joint experimental and theoretical analyses confirm its unique solution coordination structure doped with near&#8208;LCE domains. This enables the quasi&#8208;EE well inherit the advanced properties at deep&#8208;eutectic states while provide facilitated kinetics as well as lower energy barriers via a vehicle/hopping&#8208;hybridized charge transfer mechanism. Consequently, a homogeneous electroplating pattern with much enhanced Sand's time is achieved on the Zn surface, followed by a twofold prolonged service&#8208;life with drastically reduced concentration polarization. More encouragingly, the quasi&#8208;EE also delivers increased capacitance output in ZICs, which is elevated by 12.4&#8201;%&#8211;144.6&#8201;% compared to that before decoupling. Furthermore, the pouch cell with a cathodic mass loading of 36.6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maintains competitive cycling performances over 600&#8197;cycles, far exceeding other Zn&#8208;based counterparts. This work offers fresh insights into eutectic decoupling and beyond.

         <title>Dynamics of the Boundary Layer in Pulsed CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While numerous experimental investigations underscore the efficacy of pulsed CO2 electrolysis in enhancing productivity, selectivity, and stability, elucidating the underlying mechanisms remains an intricate challenge. However, modeling the boundary layer, assuming steric ion effects and non&#8208;electroneutral conditions, allows us to illuminate dynamic reorganization within the electrode microenvironment.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the field, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today's limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy efficiency when pulsing between &#8722;1.85 and &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by diffusion and not from pH&#8208;induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83&#8201;% compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.

         <title>Oxygen Functional Groups Regulate Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Molecular Electrocatalyst for Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>

A local&#8208;environmental regulation infinitely clarifies distinguishing interaction manners (remote or vicinal interaction) between different oxygen functional groups and Co center, and hence enhances the acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor represents a promising approach to industrial&#8208;level H2O2 production, while it is hampered by the lack of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts in acidic medium. Herein, we present a strategy for the specific oxygen functional group (OFG) regulation to promote the H2O2 selectivity up to 92&#8201;% in acid on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular assembled with reduced graphene oxide. In situ X&#8208;ray adsorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy combined with theoretical calculation unravel that different OFGs exert distinctive regulation effects on the electronic structure of Co center through either remote (carboxyl and epoxy) or vicinal (hydroxyl) interaction manners, thus leading to the opposite influences on the promotion in 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity. As a consequence, the PEM electrolyzer integrated with the optimized catalyst can continuously and stably produce the high&#8208;concentration of ca. 7&#8197;wt&#8201;% pure H2O2 aqueous solution at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 200&#8197;h with a cell voltage as low as ca. 2.1&#8197;V, suggesting the application potential in industrial&#8208;scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Elevating Discharge Voltage of Li2CO3&#8208;Routine Li&#8722;CO2 Battery over 2.9&#8197;V at an Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li&#8722;CO2 battery with a configuration of Li/LiTFSI&#8208;TEGDME&#8208;CoPc/Mo2C exhibits prominent temperature adaptability (&#8722;30&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical stability (1600&#8197;hours), and especially a higher discharge voltage of 2.98&#8197;V than the theoretical value (2.8&#8197;V). CoPc adsorbs CO2 to form an intermediate C33H16CoN8O2, and the reduction potential of intermediate C33H16CoN8O2 is higher than 2.8&#8197;V. This is the main reason why Li&#8722;CO2 battery has an ultra&#8208;high discharge platform.







Abstract
The Li&#8722;CO2 batteries utilizing greenhouse gas CO2 possess advantages of high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, these batteries following Li2CO3&#8208;product route typically exhibit low work voltage (&lt;2.5&#8197;V) and energy efficiency. Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as homogeneous catalyst can elevate the work plateau towards 2.98&#8197;V, which is higher than its theoretical discharge voltage without changing the Li2CO3&#8208;product route. This unprecedented discharge voltage is illustrated by mass spectrum and electrochemical analyses that CoPc has powerful adsorption capability with CO2 (&#8722;7.484&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and forms discharge intermediate of C33H16CoN8O2. Besides high discharge capacity of 18724&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and robust cyclability over 1600&#8197;hours (1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 cut&#8208;off) at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the batteries show high temperature adaptability (&#8722;30&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C). Our work is paving a promising avenue for the progress of high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>BF2&#8208;Bridged Azafulvene Dimer&#8208;Based 1064&#8201;nm Laser&#8208;Driven Superior Photothermal Agent for Deep&#8208;Seated Tumor Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A BF2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer&#8208;based superior photothermal agent (OTTBF) with high MEC was designed for combating the deep&#8208;seated tumor in NIR&#8208;II window. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D&#8208;A&#8208;D structured NIR&#8208;II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with absorption bands located in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window are highly desirable for effectively combating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, the rarely reported NIR&#8208;II absorbing PTAs still suffer from a low molar extinction coefficient (MEC, &#1013;), inadequate chemostability and photostability, as well as the high light power density required during the therapeutic process. Herein, we developed a series of boron difluoride bridged azafulvene dimer acceptor&#8208;integrated small organic PTAs. The B&#8208;N coordination bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated azafulvene dimer backbone endow it the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, facilitating the vigorous donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) structure PTAs with NIR&#8208;II absorption. Notably, the PTA namely OTTBF shows high MEC (7.21&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), ultrahigh chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. After encapsulated into water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticles, OTTBF NPs can achieve remarkable photothermal conversion effect under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation with a light density as low as 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the lowest reported NIR&#8208;II light power used in PTT process as we know. Furthermore, OTTBF NPs have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo deep&#8208;seated cancer treatments under 1064&#8197;nm laser. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D&#8208;A&#8208;D structured NIR&#8208;II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.

However, the rarely reported NIR-II absorbing PTAs still suffer from a low molar extinction coefficient (MEC, &lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;), inadequate chemostability and photostability, as well as the high light power density required during the therapeutic process. Herein, we developed a series of boron difluoride bridged azafulvene dimer acceptor-integrated small organic PTAs. The B-N coordination bonds in the &#960;-conjugated azafulvene dimer backbone endow it the strong electron-withdrawing ability, facilitating the vigorous donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) structure PTAs with NIR-II absorption. Notably, the PTA namely OTTBF shows high MEC (7.21&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ultrahigh chemo- and photo-stability. After encapsulated into water-dispersible nanoparticles, OTTBF NPs can achieve remarkable photothermal conversion effect under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation with a light density as low as 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the lowest reported NIR-II light power used in PTT process as we know. Furthermore, OTTBF NPs have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo deep-seated cancer treatments under 1064&#8197;nm laser. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D-A-D structured NIR-II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Molecular Packing of Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors via Halogen Transposition for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we propose a novel halogen transposition strategy aimed at precisely regulate the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Hence, the NFREA 3TTB&#8208;ClF, featuring a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network, achieves outstanding power conversion efficiencies of 17.46&#8201;% and 18.24&#8201;% in binary and ternary organic photovoltaic devices, respectively, marking a new milestone in the field of NFREA&#8208;based organic solar cells.







Abstract
The structure of molecular aggregates is crucial for charge transport and photovoltaic performance in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) are precisely regulated through a halogen transposition strategy, resulting in a noteworthy transformation from a 2D&#8208;layered structure to a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network. Based on the 3D electron transport pathway, the binary and ternary devices deliver outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.46&#8201;% and 18.24&#8201;%, respectively, marking the highest value for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Continuous Transformation from Membrane&#8208;Less Coacervates to Membranized Coacervates and Giant Vesicles: Toward Multicompartmental Protocells with Complex (Membrane) Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous protocell transformation system is developed. In a meticulously controlled anionic terpolymer concentration&#8208;dependent process, membrane&#8208;less coacervates can be induced into membranized coacervates and, ultimately, into giant hybrid vesicles. This transition endows protocells with diverse structural features in this system and further promotes the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments.







Abstract
The membranization of membrane&#8208;less coacervates paves the way for the exploitation of complex protocells with regard to structural and cell&#8208;like functional behaviors. However, the controlled transformation from membranized coacervates to vesicles remains a challenge. This can provide stable (multi)phase and (multi)compartmental architectures through the reconfiguration of coacervate droplets in the presence of (bioactive) polymers, bio(macro)molecules and/or nanoobjects. Herein, we present a continuous protocell transformation from membrane&#8208;less coacervates to membranized coacervates and, ultimately, to giant hybrid vesicles. This transformation process is orchestrated by altering the balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions through varying concentrations of an anionic terpolymer, leading to dynamic processes such as spontaneous membranization of terpolymer nanoparticles at the coacervate surface, disassembly of the coacervate phase mediated by the excess anionic charge, and the redistribution of coacervate components in membrane. The diverse protocells during the transformation course provide distinct structural features and molecular permeability. Notably, the introduction of multiphase coacervates in this continuous transformation process signifies advancements toward the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments. Our findings emphasize the highly controlled continuous structural reorganization of coacervate protocells and represents a novel step toward the development of advanced and sophisticated synthetic protocells with more precise compositions and complex (membrane) structures.

         <title>Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid&#8208;State Lithiation Process for High&#8208;Quality Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We clarified the relationship between precursor morphology and structural evolution of ultrahigh nickel layered cathode during solid&#8208;state lithiation. Spheroidization of precursors avoids the inhomogeneous distribution of LiOH and inhibits the preferential lithiation on particle surface, which can fundamentally solve the inhomogeneous phase transition of cathodes material. This strategy improves the cycling stability of the cathode material.







Abstract
Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid&#8208;state lithiation process. By in&#8208;depth investigation into the solid&#8208;state lithiation process of LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense

 shell during the early stage of lithiation process. The shell will hinder the diffusion of lithium and topotactic lithiation within the particles, culminating in spatially heterogeneous intermediates that can impair the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. The spheroidization of the precursor can enhance uniformity in structural evolution during solid&#8208;phase lithiation. Ultrahigh nickel cathodes derived from spherical precursors demonstrate high initial discharge specific capacity (234.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, in the range of 2.7&#8211;4.3&#8197;V) and capacity retention (89.3&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles), significantly superior to the non&#8208;spherical samples. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between precursor shape and structural transformation but also introduces a novel strategy for enhancing cathode performance through precursor spheroidization.

         <title>Compressible Hydrogels with Stabilized Chirality from Thermoresponsive Helical Dendronized Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive hydrogels were fabricated from helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers, which showed stabilized helicities originated from the copolymer precursors, and memorized the thermally&#8208;induced chiralities. These hydrogels possessed excellent mechanical properties, and exhibited unprecedent compressibility with extraordinary fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Fabrication of chiral hydrogels from thermoresponsive helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers (PPAs) carrying three&#8208;fold dendritic oligoethylene glycols (OEGs) is reported. Three different temperatures, i.e. below or above cloud point temperatures (Tcps) of the copolymers, and under freezing condition, were utilized, affording thermoresponsive hydrogels with different morphologies and mechanical properties. At room temperature, transparent hydrogels were obtained through crosslinking among different copolymer chains. Differently, opaque hydrogels with much improved mechanical properties were formed at elevated temperatures through crosslinking from the thermally dehydrated and collapsed copolymer aggregates, leading to heterogeneity for the hydrogels with highly porous morphology. While crosslinking at freezing temperature synergistically through ice templating, these amphiphilic dendronized copolymers formed hydrogels with highly porous lamellar structures, which exhibited remarkable compressible properties as human articular cartilage with excellent fatigue resistance. Amphiphilicity of the dendronized copolymers played a pivotal role in modulating the network formation during the gelation, as well as morphology and mechanical performance of the resulting hydrogels. Through crosslinking, these dendronized copolymers featured with typical dynamic helical conformations were transformed into hydrogels with unprecedently stabilized helicities due to the restrained chain mobilities in the three&#8208;dimensional networks.

         <title>Steering Geometric Reconstruction of Bismuth with Accelerated Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of elemental Cl into Bi19Cl3S27 significantly accelerates the electrochemical reconstruction process, inducing the formation of bismuth nanosheets with abundant vacancy defects. These Bi vacancies can aggregate electron density and enhance the adsorption of key intermediates *OCHO, thereby facilitating the production of formate.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy&#8208;rich defects (V&#8208;Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, experimental tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V&#8208;Bi NS exhibits up to 96&#8201;% HCOO&#8722; Faraday efficiency and 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 HCOO&#8722; partial current densities, and its electrochemical active surface area normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2&#8197;times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I&#8208;Bi NS). Density functional theory calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron&#8208;rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2&#8722; radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Hydrogen Atom Transfers for Assembly of Multi&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H Cyclopentanones</title>

A photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H cyclopentanones. The strengths are multiple including green aspects (atom&#8208;economy, photocatalysis, continuous microflow synthesis). Each step of the reaction mechanism was deciphered by DFT calculations. This work expands the scope of possibilities, which means gaining access to novel fluorinated scaffolds for biological evaluation.







Abstract
A photocatalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed to construct original polysubstituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 cyclopentanones in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This building block approach leverages trifluoromethylthio alkynes and branched/linear aldehydes, as readily available reaction partners, in consecutive hydrogen atom transfers and C&#8722;C bond formations. Difluoromethylthio alkynes are also compatible substrates. Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale&#8208;up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to support a radical&#8208;mediated cascade process.

         <title>Bimetallic Single Atom/Nanoparticle Ensemble for Efficient Photochemical Cascade Synthesis of Ethylene from Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. The synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis presents a promising approach for the activation and conversion of methane (CH4) into high value&#8208;added chemicals under ambient conditions. However, the high C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy of CH4 and the absence of well&#8208;defined C&#8722;H activation sites on catalysts significantly limit the highly efficient conversion of CH4 toward multicarbon (C2+) hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene (C2H4). Herein, we demonstrate a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade conversion of CH4 into C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs, upon effecting key bond&#8208;breaking and &#8208;forming events, lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation. This work offers a novel perspective on the advancement of photocatalytic directional CH4 conversion toward high value&#8208;added C2+ hydrocarbons through the subtle design of bimetallic cascade catalyst strategy.

         <title>Enantioselective Allylboration of Acetylene: A Versatile Tool for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the enantioselective conversion of acetylene gas under ambient temperature and pressure into a chiral orthogonally functionalized skipped diene is reported. The product represents a privileged scaffold to access the full set of stereoisomers of the chiral skipped diene core through simple stereodivergent pathways, thus serving as a versatile intermediate for the enantioselective total synthesis of natural skipped diene products.







Abstract
Efficient catalytic methods that allow the use of simple and abundant chemical feedstocks for the preparation of synthetically versatile compounds are central to modern synthetic chemistry. Acetylene is a basic feedstock with a remarkable production over one million tons per year, although it is underutilized in the stereoselective synthesis of fine chemicals. Here we report a facile catalytic multicomponent reaction that allows for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective allylboration of acetylene gas. This process is catalyzed by a chiral copper catalyst, operates without specialized equipment or pressurization, and provides chiral skipped dienes bearing stereodefined and orthogonally functionalized olefins with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The combined stereochemical features and orthogonal functionalization make the products privileged structural scaffolds to access the complete set of stereoisomers of the chiral skipped diene core through simple enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent pathways. The utility of the method is demonstrated with the enantioselective synthesis of three bioactive natural skipped diene products, namely (+)&#8208;Nyasol, (+)&#8208;Hinokiresinol and Phorbasin C, and other related synthetically relevant chiral molecules.

         <title>Mass Transfer Limitation within Molecular Crowding Electrolyte Reorienting (100) and (101) Texture for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced into Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous solution to prepare a macromolecular crowding electrolyte (MCE). Under the regulation of both specific adsorption of PVP on the Zn surface and mass transfer limitation in the MCE, the Zn deposition exhibits reoriented (100) and (101) textures. Consequently, MCE enables zinc metal batteries with dendrite&#8208;free deposition and high sustainability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries are emerging as a promising alternative for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, their development is hindered by the formation of Zn dendrites and side reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced into Zn(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aqueous solution to prepare a macromolecular crowding electrolyte (MCE). Under the regulation of both specific adsorption of PVP on the Zn surface and mass transfer limitation in the MCE, the Zn deposition exhibits reoriented (100) and (101) textures. Consequently, MCE enables zinc metal batteries with dendrite-free deposition and high sustainability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc metal batteries are emerging as a promising alternative for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, their development is hindered by the formation of Zn dendrites and side reactions. Herein, a macromolecular crowding electrolyte (MCE40) is prepared by incorporating polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into the aqueous solutions, exhibiting an enlarged electrochemical stability window and anti-freezing properties. Notably, through electrochemical measurements and characterizations, it is discovered that the mass transfer limitation near the electrode surface within the MCE40 electrolyte inhibits the (002) facets. This leads to the crystallographic reorientation of Zn deposition to expose the (100) and (101) textures, which undergo a &#8220;nucleation-merge-growth&#8221; process to form a uniform and compact Zn deposition. Consequently, the MCE40 enables highly reversible and stable Zn plating/stripping in Zn/Cu half cells over 600&#8197;cycles and in Zn/Zn symmetric cells for over 3000&#8197;hours at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, Na&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn and &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn full cells display promising capacity and sustained stability over 500&#8197;cycles at room and sub-zero temperatures. This study highlights a novel electrochemical mechanism for achieving preferential Zn deposition, introducing a unique strategy for fabricating dendrite-free zinc metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Precise Chiral Metal Nanoclusters for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag7) were successfully prepared and utilized as photoactive materials for direct CPL detection. The R/S&#8208;Ag7&#8208;based photodetectors show effective discrimination between RCP and LCP lights with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This work demonstrates the direct detection of CPL by metal clusters for the first time, paving the way for the application of chiral metal clusters in CPL detection.







Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection is of great significance in various applications such as drug identification, sensing and imaging. Atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters with intense circular dichroism (CD) signals are promising candidates for CPL detection, which can further facilitate device miniaturization and integration. Herein, we report the preparation of a pair of optically active chiral silver nanoclusters [Ag7(R/S&#8208;DMA)2(dpppy)3] (BF4)3 (R/S&#8208;Ag7) for direct CPL detection. The crystal structure and molecular formula of R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters exhibit strong CD spectra and CPL both in solution and solid states. When used as the photoactive materials in photodetectors, R/S&#8208;Ag7 enables effective discrimination between left&#8208;handed circularly polarized and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light at 520&#8197;nm with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This study is the first report on using atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters for CPL detection.

         <title>Bis&#8208;azopyrazole Photoswitches for Efficient Solar Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles have been developed to achieve highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight. The bis&#8208;azo motif features a coupled &#960;n system, which not only red&#8208;shifts the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band into the red region, but also reverses the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. Sunlight&#8208;induced photoswitches are conducive to advancing the development of sustainable light&#8208;responsive applications and bring significant opportunities for solar energy storage and conversion.







Abstract
Although natural sunlight is one of the most abundant and sustainable energy resources, only a fraction of its energy is currently harnessed and utilized in photoactive systems. The development of molecular photoswitches that can be directly activated by sunlight is imperative for unlocking the full potential of solar energy and addressing the growing energy demands. Herein, we designed a series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles featuring a coupled &#960;n system, resulting in a pronounced redshift in their spectral absorption, reaching up to 661&#8197;nm in the red region. By varying the amino substituents of these molecules, highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight can be achieved, with yields of up to 88.4&#8201;%. Moreover, the Z,Z&#8208;isomers have high thermal stability with half&#8208;lives from days to years at room temperature. The introduction of ortho&#8208;amino substitutions and meta&#8208;bisazo units leads to a reversal of the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. This change provides a new perspective for further tuning the visible absorption of azo&#8208;switches by utilizing the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band instead of the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* band. These results suggest that photoresponsive systems can be powered by sunlight instead of traditional artificial lights, thereby paving the way for sustainable smart materials and devices.

         <title>Efficient Silver(I)&#8208;Containing I&#8211;Motif DNA Hybrid Catalyst for Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver(I)&#8208;containing i&#8208;motif DNA hybrid catalyst enables the catalysis of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high reactivity and excellent enantioselectivity, in which the catalytic center of copper(II) ion specifically coordinates with one nitrogen atom of adenine and two nearby phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms in the loop region.







Abstract
The inherent chiral structures of DNA serve as attractive scaffolds to construct DNA hybrid catalysts for valuable enantioselective transformations. Duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis has made great progress, yet novel design strategies of DNA hybrid catalysts are highly demanding and atomistic analysis of active centers is still challenging. DNA i&#8208;motif structures could be finely tuned by different cytosine&#8208;cytosine base pairs, providing a new platform to design DNA catalysts. Herein, we found that a human telomeric i&#8208;motif DNA containing cytosine&#8208;silver(I)&#8208;cytosine (C&#8208;Ag+&#8208;C) base pairs interacting with Cu(II) ions (i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+) could catalyze Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with full conversions and up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. As characterized by various physicochemical techniques, the presence of Ag+ is proved to replace the protons in hemiprotonated cytosine&#8208;cytosine (C&#8201;:&#8201;C+) base pairs and stabilize the DNA i&#8208;motif to allow the acceptance of Cu(II) ions. The i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+ catalyst shows about 8&#8208;fold rate acceleration compared with DNA and Cu2+. Based on DNA mutation experiments, thermodynamic studies and density function theory calculations, the catalytic center of Cu(II) ion is proposed to be located in a specific loop region via binding to one nitrogen&#8208;7 atom of an unpaired adenine and two phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms from nearby deoxythymidine monophosphate and deoxyadenosine monophosphate, respectively.

Hexagonal comb cells of honeybees can be mimicked by assembling nanoscale molecular cylinders as reported by Hiroyuki Isobe et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406502). The molecular honeycomb encapsulated various guests with 32 different structures, which were further diversified by 6 substituents, 3 stereochemistries and 2 intercalants. Although weak CH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds were used to assemble the cylinders, the 2D crystal was grown up to the centimeter scale, allowing for mechanical exfoliation.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202405584). The maximum gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. The CPL brightness of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of previous chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+.

         <title>Inside Cover: Compressible Hydrogels with Stabilized Chirality from Thermoresponsive Helical Dendronized Poly(phenylacetylene)s (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive chiral hydrogels are fabricated from thermoresponsive helical dendronized poly(phenylacetylene)s through dynamic covalent chemistry at freezing temperature. These highly porous hydrogels possess stabilized chiralities originated from the copolymer precursors, and exhibit remarkable compressibility like human articular cartilage with full recoverability and excellent fatigue resistance, as described by Xiacong Zhang, Afang Zhang, Wen Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407552).

The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment leads to insufficient infiltration of effector lymphocytes, significantly weakening the anti&#8208;tumor immune response and promoting the tumor to become &#8220;cold&#8221;. In the cover image, tumor cells are representend as icebergs, with organelles as ice blocks floating on the ice surface. The copper peptide nanoparticles are meteorites falling from the sky, attacking multiple organelles. The ice begins to melt, symbolizing the elicited multiple cell death pathways, and also indicating the transformation of cold tumors into hot tumors, as illustrated by Ling Wang, Jie Gao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406602).

         <title>Aluminum in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>

Frustrated Aluminum! The field of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) gained increased interest over the past 18&#8197;years. The majority of FLP systems consist of boron Lewis acids. This review highlights the developments in the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic application of intermolecular, intramolecular and hidden aluminum FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases.







Abstract
This review article describes the development of the use of aluminum compounds in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) over the last 14&#8197;years. It also discusses the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic applications of intermolecular, intramolecular and so&#8208;called hidden FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases. The intrinsically higher acidity of aluminum compounds compared to their boron analogs opens up different reaction pathways. The results are presented in a more or less chronological order. It is shown that Al FLPs react with a variety of polar and non&#8208;polar substrates and form both stable adducts and reversibly activate bonds. Consequently, some catalytic applications of the title compounds were presented such as dimerization of alkynes, hydrogenation of tert&#8208;butyl ethylene and imines, C&#8722;F bond activation, reduction of CO2, dehydrogenation of amine borane and transfer of ammonia. In addition, various Al FLPs were used as initiators in polymerization reactions.

This review summarizes recent progress in the development of electrochemical glutamate sensors through the co&#8208;design of materials, interfaces, and electronics. It covers various aspects including operational principles, assessment techniques, and applications as bio&#8208;integrated electronics in animal research. We also provide an outlook on the development of the next generation glutamate sensors for neuroscience and neuroengineering, with the aim of offering practical guidance for future research.







Abstract
Glutamate is one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters within the mammalian central nervous system. The role of glutamate in regulating neural network signaling transmission through both synaptic and extra&#8208;synaptic paths highlights the importance of the real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of its concentration and dynamics in living organisms. Progresses in multidisciplinary research have promoted the development of electrochemical glutamate sensors through the co&#8208;design of materials, interfaces, electronic devices, and integrated systems. This review summarizes recent works reporting various electrochemical sensor designs and their applicability as miniaturized neural probes to in vivo sensing within biological environments. We start with an overview of the role and physiological significance of glutamate, the metabolic routes, and its presence in various bodily fluids. Next, we discuss the design principles, commonly employed validation models/protocols, and successful demonstrations of multifunctional, compact, and bio&#8208;integrated devices in animal models. The final section provides an outlook on the development of the next generation glutamate sensors for neuroscience and neuroengineering, with the aim of offering practical guidance for future research.

         <title>Polycatenanes Formed of Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the most relevant examples of polycatenanes in which the catenating subcomponents forming the mechanical bonds are interlocked three&#8208;dimensional metal organic cages (MOCs). We emphasize the beneficial aspects of mechanical bond formation among MOCs, synthetic approaches, supramolecular topologies, and structure&#8211;function correlations. The experimental and theoretical aspects of polycatenanes made of MOCs have also been investigated.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenanes (PCs) self&#8208;assembled of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal organic cages (MOCs) (hereafter referred to as PCs&#8208;MOCs) are a relatively new class of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) that combine the properties of MOCs and polymers. The synthesis of PCs&#8208;MOCs is challenging because of the difficulties associated with interlocking MOCs, the occurrence of multiple weak supramolecular electrostatic interactions between cages, and the importance of solvent templating effects. The high density of mechanical bonds interlocking the MOCs endows the MOCs with mechanical and physical properties such as enhanced stability, responsive dynamic behavior and low solubility, which can unlock new functional properties. In this Minireview, we highlight the benefit of interlocking MOCs in the formation of PCs&#8208;MOCs structures as well as the synthetic approaches exploited in their preparation, from thermodynamic to kinetic methods, both in the solution and solid&#8208;states. Examples of PCs&#8208;MOCs self&#8208;assembled from various types of nanosized cages (i.e., tetrahedral, trigonal prismatic, octahedral and icosahedral) are described in this article, providing an overview of the research carried out in this area. The focus is on the structure&#8211;property relationship with examples of functional applications such as electron conductivity, X&#8208;ray attenuation, gas adsorption and molecular sensing. We believe that the structural and functional aspects of the reviewed PCs&#8208;MOCs will attract chemists in this research field with great potential as new functional materials in nanotechnological disciplines such as gas adsorption, sensing and photophysical properties such as X&#8208;ray attenuation or electron conductivity.

&lt;p&gt;Poly-[n]-catenanes (PCs) self-assembled of three-dimensional (3D) metal organic cages (MOCs) (hereafter referred to as PCs-MOCs) are a relatively new class of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) that combine the properties of MOCs and polymers. The synthesis of PCs-MOCs is challenging because of the difficulties associated with interlocking MOCs, the occurrence of multiple weak supramolecular electrostatic interactions between cages, and the importance of solvent templating effects. The high density of mechanical bonds interlocking the MOCs endows the MOCs with mechanical and physical properties such as enhanced stability, responsive dynamic behavior and low solubility, which can unlock new functional properties. In this Minireview, we highlight the benefit of interlocking MOCs in the formation of PCs-MOCs structures as well as the synthetic approaches exploited in their preparation, from thermodynamic to kinetic methods, both in the solution and solid-states. Examples of PCs-MOCs self-assembled from various types of nanosized cages (i.e., tetrahedral, trigonal prismatic, octahedral and icosahedral) are described in this article, providing an overview of the research carried out in this area. The focus is on the structure&#8211;property relationship with examples of functional applications such as electron conductivity, X-ray attenuation, gas adsorption and molecular sensing. We believe that the structural and functional aspects of the reviewed PCs-MOCs will attract chemists in this research field with great potential as new functional materials in nanotechnological disciplines such as gas adsorption, sensing and photophysical properties such as X-ray attenuation or electron conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Molecular Sieving of High&#8208;Humidity C2H4/C2H6 Mixture by a Hydrophobic Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic and flexible metal&#8211;organic framework shows weak adsorption affinity and high structural transition pressure at ambient temperature, which enables C2H4/C2H6 molecular sieving under high&#8208;pressure and wet conditions.







Abstract
Molecular sieving is an ideal separation mechanism, but controlling pore size, restricting framework flexibility, and avoiding strong adsorption are all very challenging. Here, we report a flexible adsorbent showing molecular sieving at ambient temperature and high pressure, even under high humidity. While typical guest&#8208;induced transformations are observed, a high transition pressure of 16.6&#8197;atm is observed for C2H4 at 298&#8197;K because of very weak C2H4 adsorption (~16&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Also, C2H6 is completely excluded below the pore&#8208;opening pressure of 7.7&#8197;atm, giving single&#8208;component selectivity of ca. 300. Quantitative high&#8208;pressure column breakthrough experiments using 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C2H4/C2H6 mixtures at 10&#8197;atm as input confirm molecular sieving with C2H4 adsorption of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 or 32&#8197;cm3(STP) cm&#8722;3 and negligible C2H6 adsorption of 0.001(2) mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the adsorbent can be completely regenerated by inert gas purging. Furthermore, it is highly hydrophobic with negligible water adsorption, and the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance is unaffected at high humidity.

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Structure in Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the relationship between solvation structure and ion transportation and interphase chemistry in polymer electrolytes. By combining strong Li+&#8208;ether interactions and weak Li+&#8208;ester interactions with steric hindrance, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+). The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure makes it be compatible with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode with middle&#8208;high areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Our work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are promising electrolytes for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. However, traditional ether&#8208;based polymer electrolytes are limited by their low lithium&#8208;ion conductivity and narrow electrochemical window because of the well&#8208;defined and intimated Li+&#8208;oxygen binding topologies in the solvation structure. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to reduce the Li+&#8208;polymer interaction and strengthen the anion&#8208;polymer interaction by combining strong Li+&#8208;O (ether) interactions, weak Li+&#8208;O (ester) interactions with steric hindrance in polymer electrolytes. In this way, a polymer electrolyte with a high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and anion&#8208;rich solvation structure is obtained. This polymer electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and compatibility with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode. Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells with middle&#8208;high active material areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) can stably cycle at 4.5&#8197;V. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.

         <title>A Modular Dual&#8208;Catalytic Aryl&#8208;Chlorination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dual catalysis strategy for the modular synthesis of highly functionalized and structurally diverse 1&#8208;aryl, 2&#8208;chloroalkanes via the coupling of diaryliodonium salts, alkenes, and potassium chloride.







Abstract
Alkyl chlorides are a class of versatile building blocks widely used to generate C(sp3)&#8208;rich scaffolds through transformation such as nucleophilic substitution, radical addition reactions and metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling processes. Despite their utility in the synthesis of high&#8208;value functional molecules, distinct methods for the preparation of alkyl chlorides are underrepresented. Here, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dual catalysis strategy for the modular synthesis of highly functionalized and structurally diverse arylated chloroalkanes via the coupling of diaryliodonium salts, alkenes and potassium chloride. A distinctive aspect of this transformation is a ligand&#8208;design&#8208;driven approach for the development of a copper(II)&#8208;based atom&#8208;transfer catalyst that enables the aryl&#8208;chlorination of electron&#8208;poor alkenes, complementing its iron(III)&#8208;based counterpart that accommodates non&#8208;activated aliphatic alkenes and styrene derivatives. The complementarity of the two dual catalytic systems allows the efficient aryl&#8208;chlorination of alkenes bearing different stereo&#8208;electronic properties and a broad range of functional groups, maximizing the structural diversity of the 1&#8208;aryl, 2&#8208;chloroalkane products.

         <title>Radical Fluorosulfonamidation: A Facile Access to Sulfamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium (FSAP) was designed and synthesized as a redox&#8208;active fluorosulfamoyl radical precursor, which can be applied in radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. Further utilization in the radical 1,2&#8208;functionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions of olefins is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Recently, the introduction of fluorosulfonyl (&#8722;SO2F) groups have attracted considerable research interests, as this moiety could often afford enhanced activities and new functions in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium (FSAP) salts, which could serve as an effective photoredox&#8208;active precursor to fluorosulfamoyl radicals and enable the direct radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. This method features mild conditions, visible light, broad substrate scope, good group tolerance, etc., and a metal&#8208;free protocol is also viable by using organic photocatalysts. Further, FSAP can also be applied to the radical functionalization of alkenes via 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions, etc. In addition, a formal C&#8722;H methylamination of (hetero)arenes by combining this radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation with subsequent hydrolysis as well as product derivatization are also demonstrated.

Herein, we report the design and synthesis of 1-fluorosulfamoyl-pyridinium (FSAP) salts, which could serve as an effective photoredox-active precursor to fluorosulfamoyl radicals and enable the direct radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. This method features mild conditions, visible light, broad substrate scope, good group tolerance, etc., and a metal-free protocol is also viable by using organic photocatalysts. Further, FSAP can also be applied to the radical functionalization of alkenes via 1,2-difunctionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical-polar crossover reactions, etc. In addition, a formal C&#8722;H methylamination of (hetero)arenes by combining this radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation with subsequent hydrolysis as well as product derivatization are also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Packing Polymorphism of Oxindole: An Exploration Inspired by Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of computational predictions, along with innovative crystallization techniques for oxindole, has led to the discovery of four new forms and the reconstruction of a previously presumed &#8220;disappearing polymorph&#8221;. The findings have established a new record for the largest number of packing polymorphs for rigid organic systems, where variations are indeed due to distinct crystalline packing arrangements with the same molecular conformation.







Abstract
Crystal polymorphism, characterized by different packing arrangements of the same compound, strongly ties to the physical properties of a molecule. Determining the polymorphic landscape is complex and time&#8208;consuming, with the number of experimentally observed polymorphs varying widely from molecule to molecule. Furthermore, disappearing polymorphs, the phenomenon whereby experimentally observed forms cannot be reproduced, pose a significant challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Herein, we focused on oxindole (OX), a small rigid molecule with four known polymorphs, including a reported disappearing form. Using crystal structure prediction (CSP), we assessed OX solid&#8208;state landscape and thermodynamic stability by comparing predicted structures with experimentally known forms. We then performed melt and solution crystallization in bulk and nanoconfinement to validate our predictions. These experiments successfully reproduced the known forms and led to the discovery of four novel polymorphs. Our approach provided insights into reconstructing disappearing polymorphs and building more comprehensive polymorph landscapes. These results also establish a new record of packing polymorphism for rigid molecules.

         <title>Bioinspired Tetranuclear Manganese Cubane Complex as an Efficient Molecular Electrocatalyst for Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation Towards Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired tetranuclear manganese complex with a cubane structure has been developed to electrocatalyze water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. This complex demonstrates an optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87&#8201;%, which is amongst (if not) the highest FE(H2O2) of reported homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Stable homogeneous two&#8208;electron water oxidation electrocatalysts are highly demanded to understand the precise mechanism and reaction intermediates of electrochemical H2O2 production. Here we report a tetranuclear manganese complex with a cubane structure which can electrocatalyze water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide under alkaline and neutral conditions. Such a complex demonstrates an optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87&#8201;%, which is amongst (if not) the highest FE(H2O2) of reported homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts. In addition, active species were identified and co&#8208;catalysts were excluded through ESI&#8208;MS characterization. Furthermore, we identified water binding sites and isolated one&#8208;electron oxidation intermediate by chemical oxidation of the catalyst in the presence of water substrates. It is evident that efficient proton&#8208;accepting electrolytes avoid rapid proton building&#8208;up at electrode and substantially improve reaction rate and selectivity. Accordingly, we propose a two&#8208;electron catalytic cycle model for water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide with the bioinspired molecular electrocatalyst. The present work is expected to provide an ideal platform to elucidate the two&#8208;electron WOR mechanism at the atomic level.

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Amination Reactions Mediated by Visible Light and a Chiral Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron porphyrin that is linked via an ethynyl unit to a chiral octahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoisoindol&#8208;1&#8208;one scaffold serves as a potent catalyst for the enantioselective, visible light&#8208;mediated intermolecular amination of 3&#8208;arylmethyl&#8208;substituted quinolones and pyridones. A two&#8208;point hydrogen bonding interaction is responsible for the exquisite site&#8208; and enantioselectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a chiral iron porphyrin catalyst, various 3&#8208;arylmethyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones and 2&#8208;pyridones underwent an enantioselective amination reaction (20&#8197;examples; 93&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The substrates were used as the limiting reagents, and fluorinated aryl azides (1.5&#8197;equivalents) served as nitrene precursors. The reaction is triggered by visible light which allows a facile dediazotation at ambient temperature. The selectivity of the reaction is governed by a two&#8208;point hydrogen bond interaction between the ligand of the iron catalyst and the substrate. Hydrogen bonding directs the amination to a specific hydrogen atom within the substrate that is displaced by the nitrogen substituent either in a concerted fashion or by a rebound mechanism.

We present a novel intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system ([12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe) based on cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) grafted with eight di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino groups (TPAOMe) as donors.

Abstract

Compared to [12]CPP, D&#8722;A nanohoop exhibited significant changes in physical properties, including a large redshift (&gt;78&#8197;nm) in the fluorescence spectrum and novel positive solvatofluorochromic properties with a maximum peak ranging from 484&#8197;nm to 546&#8197;nm. The potential applications of [12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe in electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport devices were further investigated, and its bipolar behavior as a charge transport active layer was clearly observed.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Cyclic Sulfonimidamides by Asymmetric Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the desymmetrization of cyclic sulfonimidamides via a palladium catalyzed asymmetric allylation. The products are further elaborated to novel tricyclic ring systems containing a stereogenic sulfur center. Mechanistic insights to the origin of selectivity are highlighted through computational studies.







Abstract
Herein we report the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed approach to the enantioenriched synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides relying on commercially available palladium catalysts and ligands. High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to identify the optimal catalyst system and solvent. The method is applied to a variety of saturated and unsaturated rings and exhibits the highest selectivity for 2&#8208;substituted allyl electrophiles. The products are further elaborated to complex, tricyclic scaffolds. DFT experiments presented herein highlight the key ligand substrate interactions leading to the high levels of enantioselectivity.

Mechanistic insights to the origin of selectivity are highlighted through computational studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the first transition metal-catalyzed approach to the enantioenriched synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides relying on commercially available palladium catalysts and ligands. High-throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to identify the optimal catalyst system and solvent. The method is applied to a variety of saturated and unsaturated rings and exhibits the highest selectivity for 2-substituted allyl electrophiles. The products are further elaborated to complex, tricyclic scaffolds. DFT experiments presented herein highlight the key ligand substrate interactions leading to the high levels of enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transpiration&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Growth of Texture Hydrogel Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PIC hydrogels contained isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids. Like trees, transpiration would induce voids reversibly collapse to generate negative pressures within the matrices to extract polymerizable compounds from external sources for growing. The hydrogel mimics the function of trees, which can grow user&#8208;defined complex structures on surfaces from different external sources.







Abstract
Trees grow by coupling the transpiration&#8208;induced nutrient absorption from external sources and photosynthesis&#8208;based nutrient integration. Inspired by this manner, we designed a class of polyion complex (PIC) hydrogels containing isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids for growing texture surfaces. The isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids were created via irreversible matrix reconfiguration in a deswelling&#8208;swelling process. During transpiration, these voids reversibly collapse to generate negative pressures within the matrices to extract polymerizable compounds from external sources and deliver them to the surface of the samples for photopolymerization. This growth process is spatial&#8208;controllable and can be applied to fabricate complex patterns consisting of different compositions, suggesting a new strategy for making texture surfaces.

         <title>[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) Displaying N&#8208;Fusion, Pyrrole&#8208;Rearrangement, and Dimerization Reactions Upon Oxidation and Metalation</title>

[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) synthesized by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dipyrrolyethenes show roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. Upon oxidation, the 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave N&#8208;fusion and pyrrole&#8208;rearranged products, which were effectively dimerized upon treatment with CuCl.







Abstract
Exploration of expanded porphyrins with unprecedented reactivities has remained important. Here [22]pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) were synthesized as a constitutional isomer of sapphyrin by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;di(pyrro&#8208;2&#8208;ly)ethenes. These pentaphyrins display roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. The 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave an N&#8208;fused product and an unprecedented pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product, depending upon the oxidation conditions. Remarkably, upon the metalation with CuCl, the N&#8208;fused product and the pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product afforded an inner &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled face&#8208;to&#8208;face CuII complex dimer and an outer &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled lateral CuII complex dimer, respectively, in fairly good yields. Further, [22]pentaphyrin(2.0.1.1.0) fused with a NiII porphyrin was effectively dimerized upon oxidation with MnO2 to give a 16&#8211;16&#8217; directly linked dl&#8208;dimer.

Strong magnetic interactions with the magnetic parameter J=&#8722;37.9&#8197;cm&#8722;1, despite the long distance of 13&#8197;&#197; between the Ni(+2) atoms, was realized in heterometallic one&#8208;dimensional chain aligned as &#8722;Rh&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ni&#8722;Pt&#8722;. This magnitude was not realized with other molecules, clearly demonstrating the utility of bridging metal&#8211;metal bonds.







Abstract
A heterometallic and paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional aligned chain in &#8722;Rh(+2)&#8722;Rh(+2)&#8722; Pt(+2)&#8722;Ni(+2)&#8722;Pt(+2)&#8722; with direct metal&#8722;metal bonds was obtained via HOMO&#8211;LUMO interactions at the &#963;* (dz2) orbital between [Rh2(O2CCH3)4] and [Pt2Ni(piam)4(NH3)4] (piam=pivalamidate). The one&#8208;dimensional chains had straight backbones attributed to face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking of each complex, and the Ni atoms were separated by approximately 13&#8197;&#197; from four different metals.

         <title>Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations exhibited large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL=&#8722;1.54), which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.







Abstract
Large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in ligand and coordination tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements, single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the gCPL value. The emission quantum yield and photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.
