         <title>Mechanistic Promiscuity in Cobalt Mediated CO2 Reduction Reaction: One&#8208; versus Two&#8208;Electron Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We compare the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) activity and selectivity of the complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+, which contain two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine chelating groups linked by &#8208;NH or &#8208;NCH3 moieties, respectively. Whereas [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ forms CO under electrocatalytic conditions in presence of phenol (PhOH) with high selectivity, [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+ shows higher hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low selectivity for CO production. The molecular origin of the difference in product selectivity was analysed based on spectroscopic trapping of reactive intermediates and detailed kinetic and theoretical studies. A difference in mechanism is evident; whereas an efficient proton relay mediated by the &#8208;NH group initiates a two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 in case of [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+, one&#8208;electron chemistry prevails for [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+. Under stopped&#8208;flow conditions, we trapped the one&#8208;electron reduced CO2 radical anion in [(Mebbpya)CoI(CO2&#8208;&#8226;)], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions. This study underlines the importance of subtle electronic and protonation changes in controlling the CO2RR product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Piezochromic Luminescence in Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Molecular Insertion: Blue&#8208;Shifted and Enhanced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials typically exhibit pressure&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifted&#160;and quenched emission due to enhanced intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and molecular planarization. Consequently, achieving blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains a significant&#160;challenge. Here, we report anomalous piezochromic luminescence&#160;in covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) via&#160;molecular insertion. Upon introducing methanol into the nanopores of CTFs, a blue&#8208;shift in emission from 507.0 to 485.5 nm, accompanied by enhanced intensity, is observed under compression up to 1.22&#160;GPa, distinctly contrasting the red&#8208;shifted and quenched emission typically observed in compressed pristine CTFs and other crystalline porous materials (CPMs).&#160;Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal&#160;that methanol can weaken the interlayer &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and intralayer conjugation of CTFs by forming weak interactions with CTFs, such as hydrogen bonding, to realize the interlayer slip and intralayer distortions of CTFs, which results in the blue&#8208;shifted&#160;and enhanced emission. This strategy also proves effective with other molecular insertions, offering a general approach to achieving anomalous piezochromic luminescence in CTFs. Our findings establish molecular insertion as a robust method for engineering pressure&#8208;responsive luminescent materials and provide valuable insights for the design of advanced optical sensors and stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>PCET Photodecarboxylation for SN2&#8217;&#8208;Type Alkylation of gem&#8208;Dichlorocyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with organometallic reagents remained unsuccessful.

In this process, Csp3&#8208;enriched 4&#8208;alkylated 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenones are obtained with commendable functionality tolerance. A PCET photodecarboxylation enables for the first time SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with b&#8208;H&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, addressing several challenges. This mild and scalable Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond&#8208;forging alkylation applies to the functionalization of natural product&#8208;derived gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with carboxylic acid drugs, fatty acids and steroids.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling to Access Polysubstituted Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between homopropargyl halides and aryl/vinyl electrophiles provided direct access to polysubstituted cyclobutenes. Experimental data and computational studies support a reductive 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization involving an alkenyl nickel(I) intermediate, which undergoes facile SH2 attack to produce the strained cyclobutene ring with overall stereoinversion at the homopropargylic position.








Abstract
The synthesis of cyclobutenes remains inefficient owing to inherent ring strain and poor regioselectivity. We describe herein a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between readily accessible homopropargyl halides and commercially available aryl/vinyl electrophiles for direct access to polysubstituted cyclobutenes. This approach provides the first reductive 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, which paves the way for the synthesis of diverse cyclobutene containing compounds (including synthetically challenging macrocycles). The synthesis of an antitumor&#8208;active combretastatin A&#8208;4 analog has been significantly optimized; the original six&#8208;step procedure yielding 14% has been streamlined into a three&#8208;step process with a markedly improved yield of 51%. Experimental data and computational studies support a mechanism involving an alkenyl nickel(I) intermediate, which undergoes facile back&#8208;side SH2 attack to produce the strained cyclobutene ring with overall stereoinversion at the homopropargylic position.

         <title>Crystallization/Precipitation Driven Nonequilibrium Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Thiovalerolactone Toward Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Polythioester with Excellent Barrier Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the precipitation/crystallization driven nonequilibrium ROP of &#948;TVL to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PTVL with capability to recycle back to pristine monomer from a commodity plastic waste mixture. The good thermal and mechanical performances, superior barrier properties, and intrinsic closed&#8208;loop recyclability make PTVL as a promising chemical recyclable packaging material.








Abstract
The development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers with comparable performances with commodity plastics remains as a challenge to establish a circular plastic economy. In this contribution, we propose a precipitation/crystallization driven nonequilibrium ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;thiovalerolactone (&#948;TVL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PTVL in the presence of a strong base/urea binary catalyst. The obtained PTVL exhibits good thermal and mechanical performances as well as superior barrier properties comparable with some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained PTVL can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a high yield and purity by distillation from a commodity plastic waste mixture without tedious separation, highlighting its great potential as a closed&#8208;loop recyclable packaging material.

We present a novel series of porous coordination cages specifically designed to enhance the efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Our research tackles the significant limitations of existing sonosensitizers by utilizing the atomic precision and well&#8208;defined structures of these porous coordination cages.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasive approach for immunotherapy. However, its broad applicability is often limited by the inefficiency of sonosensitizers. Here, we introduce a novel series of porous coordination cages (PCCs) specifically engineered to enhance sonodynamic therapeutic performance for the first time. These PCCs incorporate energy harvesting and conversion components, with variations in bandgap, electrical conductivity, and redox activity. Characterized by atomically precise compositions and well&#8208;defined structures, the PCCs enable strategic manipulation of functionalized moieties and metal centers, allowing for precise control over their sonodynamic efficiency. Their small particle size enhances penetration through dense tumor extracellular matrices, significantly improving tumor permeability. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the PCCs exhibit robust sonodynamic effects, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumor cells, which triggers apoptosis and antigens release. Notably, PCC&#8208;1 demonstrates metal&#8208;mediated catalytic activity, converting endogenous hydrogen peroxide into additional ROS, synergistically enhancing SDT efficacy and activating the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway in dendritic cells. In tumor model, PCCs effectively inhibited tumor growth and activated immune responses both locally and systemically. Collectively, these findings underscore the exceptional sonodynamic&#8208;immunotherapeutic potential of PCCs, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor treatment.

         <title>Supramolecular TADF Materials from Calix[3]Acridan and Guest&#8208;Linked Polymers for Rapid and Visual Detection of Trace Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the rapid and visual detection of trace benzene was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A based on luminescence color change mechanism, and the limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1. Moreover, GP1@C[3]A was fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane.








Abstract
In this work, a new strategy for rapid and visual detection of trace benzene vapor was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) polymeric materials via luminescence change mechanism. Consequently, a new type of multi&#8208;color STADF polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A were constructed by host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[3]acridan (C[3]A) and different guest&#8208;linked polymers (GPs). Interestingly, by adjusting the added molar proportion of C[3]A, multi&#8208;color TADF property of GPs@C[3]A could also be easily tuned. Notably, when a 20% molar ratio of C[3]A was added, GP1@C[3]A exhibited white luminescence. Especially, by using the high selectivity of C[3]A toward benzene and its differential binding affinities for acceptor guests versus benzene, rapid detection of trace benzene vapor was achieved in few seconds with the naked eyes. The limit of detection concentrations for benzene reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1, indicating GPs@C[3]A could be used as an excellent sensor for rapid detection of benzene at trace level. Furthermore, GP1@C[3]A could also be fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane. This work offers an innovative idea for the application of STADF materials in detection, and also addresses the key challenge of simultaneously improving sensitivity, selectivity and visualization in benzene detection.

         <title>Synergistic Ru Species on Poly(heptazine imide) Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with H2O beyond 800 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst is assembled by precisely anchoring Ru SAs and NPs on PHI via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#9472;N bonds, creating a build&#8208;in electron field (BIEF) that directs charge separation and rushes electron migration to Ru NPs, together with an Ru SA&#8208;induced impurity level to extend optical harvesting. The catalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for CO2 reduction with H2O, affording a record&#8208;high AQE beyond 800&#160;nm, while generating the valuable oxidation product H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion with H2O to carbonaceous fuels is a desirable strategy for CO2 management and solar utilization, yet its efficiency remains suboptimal. Herein, efficient and durable CO2 photoreduction is realized over a RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst assembled by anchoring Ru single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) onto poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#8208;N bonds, respectively. This catalyst shows an unsurpassed CO production (32.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1), a record&#8208;high apparent quantum efficiency (0.26%) beyond 800&#160;nm, and the formation of the valuable H2O2. Ru SAs tune PHI's electronic structure to promote in&#8208;plane charge transfer to Ru NPs, forming a built&#8208;in electron field at the interface, which directs electron&#8208;hole separation and rushes excited electron movement from Ru&#8208;PHI to Ru NPs. Simultaneously, Ru SAs introduce an impurity level in PHI to endow long&#8208;wavelength photoabsorption, while Ru NPs strengthen CO2 adsorption/activation and expedite CO desorption. These effects of Ru species together effectively ensure CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The CO2 reduction on the catalyst is revealed to follow the pathway CO2&#8594; *CO2&#8594; *COOH&#8594; *CO&#8594; CO, based on the intermediates identified by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and further supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Boosting Initial Coulombic Efficiency in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;based Cathodes by Tuning Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the potential of Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, highlighting the critical challenges posed by low initial coulombic efficiency and irreversible oxygen release. We introduce a novel treatment method using Glyoxal, which facilitates the integration of transition metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbital hybridization, aimed at optimizing the electrochemical performance of LRMO. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in ICE, increasing from 85.3% to 102.5%. Additionally, the treated LRMO achieves a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, surpassing untreated samples, and exhibits excellent cycling stability with retention rates of 90.1% after 150 cycles and 76.5% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. 








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMO) are promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;cost merits. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and irreversible oxygen release of LRMO severely hinder their commercialization processes. Here, we employ glyoxal treatment to modulate the hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen (O) 2p orbitals in LRMO. This approach is found to reduce the Co/Mn t2g&#8208;O 2p hybridization in LRMO while simultaneously activating the Co2+/Co3+ redox below the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that tuning TM 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization can be a viable approach to improve the ICE of LMRO. Specifically, the ICE of LRMO can be elevated from 85.3% to 102.5%, and a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 0.1 C. Moreover, the treated LRMO cathodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacity retention.

         <title>Wide Temperature 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The critical role of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in determining the temperature&#8208;dependent performance of lithium metal batteries is unveiled. Through SEI chemistry regulation with a wide temperature adaption electrolyte, 5.8 Ah pouch cells achieve energy density of 503.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C with a lifespan of 260 cycles and outstanding energy density of 339&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The performance of lithium metal batteries is significantly affected by temperature variations, which makes it challenging for them to operate across a wide temperature range. Herein, a wide temperature adaption electrolyte is proposed, enabling excellent electrochemical performance of lithium metal batteries from &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Large, 5.8 Ah pouch cells employing such an electrolyte achieve high energy density of 503.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C with a lifespan of 260 cycles and outstanding energy density of 339&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The critical role of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in determining the temperature&#8208;dependent performance of lithium metal batteries is unveiled. It is demonstrated that the LiF&#8208;rich, anion&#8208;derived SEI facilitates Li+ diffusion in SEI. Moreover, accelerated Li+ desolvation at SEI is observed. These two aspects promote the kinetics of lithium metal anodes and further inhibit the dendrite growth at low temperatures. This work showcases the importance of understating the chemistry of SEI to enable wide temperature lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Redirecting the Peptide Cleavage Causes Protease Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine and serine proteases cleave peptides through covalent catalysis by generating a transient adduct with the
N&#8208;terminal part of the substrate after releasing its C&#8208;terminal part. We demonstrate the unique redirection of this event leading to strong enzyme inactivation. For targeting human cathepsin B, a cysteine protease of significant therapeutic importance, we designed tailored peptidomimetics with a variety of dipeptide fragments directed towards the occluding loop and equipped with numerous N&#8208;terminal carbamate warheads. The carbamate deprotonation catalyzed by the active site thiolate initiates the redirected cleavage. The C&#8208;terminal part of the inhibitors remains covalently attached to the protease. Hydrolysis of such carbamoyl&#8208;enzyme complexes is catalytically unsupported rendering inhibition irreversible. This novel mechanism of action comprises a significant extension of the covalent drug space.</dc:description>

         <title>A universal P&#8208;type heterointerface for efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted perovskite solar cells with self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. However, the hole extraction at the SAMs/perovskite interface is generally less efficient with respect to the electron extraction. Here, we report the construction of a universal P&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite with heterocyclic dipolar compounds imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI). We found that the strong interaction by hydrogen bonds together with formative dipole layer were observed between ImHI and perovskite. This allows more P&#8208;type contacts with relatively small energy barriers at SAMs/perovskite heterointerfaces by downshifting the Fermi level, reducing the energy mismatch and facilitating the hole extraction. The P&#8208;type contact enhancement was further confirmed by a series of SAMs at the perovskite buried interface. As a result, a best&#8208;performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000 h under nitrogen&#8208;filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800 h at 55&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000 h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Selective Mineralization of Organohalides on Spatially Close Au Single&#8208;Atom and Nanocluster Neighbors over Poly(heptazine imides)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organohalides are commonly found pollutants with long&#8208;term persistence in industrial wastewater and drinkable water. Although these pollutants only constitute a small portion of the total organic carbon (TOC), they contribute major toxicity, posing a threat to ecosystem, biodiversity, and public health. Selective removal of organohalides from wastewater/drinkable water is costly due to the orders of magnitude lower concentration of organohalides as compared to interferences. Herein, spatially close Au single atoms and nanoclusters composing of approximately 3&#8208;10 Au atoms were grown on highly crystalline potassium&#8208;incorporated poly(heptazine imides). Microscopy and spectroscopy characterizations together with theoretical calculations revealed that under visible&#8208;light illumination, the highly localized photogenerated holes could enable simultaneous generation of &#8226;OH on Au single atoms and selective adsorption of organohalides on Au nanoclusters, which greatly promoted the targeted removal of trace organohalides in water containing high concentrations of interferences. The fixed&#8208;bed photoreactor built using the spatially close Au single atoms and nanoclusters on poly(heptazine imides) achieved quick degradation of refractory organohalide pollutants in tap water and ground water (2 L h&#8208;1), exhibiting an over 3&#8208;fold log efficiency enhancement compared to traditional advanced oxidation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Chalcogen&#8208;Bonded Shape Memory Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) incorporating chalcogen bonds (ChBs) have been synthesized and investigated for shape memory and actuation properties. LCEs featuring strong Se&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N ChBs (&#8211;40 to &#8211;43 kJ/mol) exhibit both shape memory effects (SME) and reversible actuation, while those with weaker S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N ChBs (&#8211;32 to &#8211;34 kJ/mol) do not. The Se&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N&#8208;based LCEs transition from one&#8208;way to two&#8208;way SME after three days at room temperature, enabling programmable 2D/3D shape transformations and rewritable surface patterns. They also enable the fabrication of light&#8208;powered crawling robots as well as temperature&#8208;responsive knot&#8208;like actuators. These results highlight the critical role of the ChB strength and specificity in designing functional materials. Solid&#8208;state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations provide further molecular&#8208;level insights into ChB interactions, laying the groundwork for advanced supramolecular actuators and shape&#8208;morphing LCEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Imine Reductase Catalyzed Remote Stereocontrol for Enantiodivergent Synthesis of Cyclohexylidene&#8208;Based Axially Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines exhibit unique axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond and have shown great potential in medicinal chemistry. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging due to the long distance between the chirally relevant groups. Here, we report a highly efficient and asymmetric synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines from 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones and primary amines catalyzed by imine&#8208;reductases (IREDs). Enantiodivergent IREDs were identified to provide convenient access to both enantiomers of chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield, 99:1 or 1:99 enantiomeric ratio). A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines was also achieved. Moreover, protein X&#8208;ray crystallography and molecular modeling studies were conducted to provide structural insights into the remote stereocontrol of IREDs in forming cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axial chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Shaping of a Reactive Manganese Catalyst Enables Access to Polyfunctionalized Cyclohexanes via Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation of 1,3&#8208;meso Diethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral polyoxygenated cyclohexanes are valuable constituents of biologically relevant products. Herein, we report a protocol for the direct access to these scaffolds via site&#8208; and enantioselective non&#8208;directed oxidation of cyclohexyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;meso&#8208;diethers using aqueous H2O2. Structural shaping of a highly reactive chiral Mn&#8208;oxo species, achieved through the combination of a sterically encumbered ligand and a bulky carboxylic acid, promotes a precise fit of the substrate within the catalyst pocket, which translate into exceptional enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). Computational studies reveal that C&#8211;H oxidation proceeds via an initial hydrogen atom transfer, followed by electron transfer, leading to the formation of a chiral cationic intermediate. The resulting desymmetrized 3&#8208;methoxycyclohexanone products serve as valuable intermediates for the synthesis of bioactive cores, as they can undergo orthogonal chemical modifications to enable further structural diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>A Synergistic Photocatalysis&#8208;Electrocatalysis System for Efficient Hydrogen Generation and Energy&#8208;Saving Benzylamine Oxidative Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting represents a promising tactic for H2 generation, but the light&#8208;shielding effect induced by the generated I3&#8208; greatly impedes subsequent reactions. A critical challenge in this field lies in achieving the timely reduction of I3&#8208; while avoiding the use of additional sacrificial agents, such as H3PO2. Herein, we develop a synergistic photocatalysis&#8208;electrocatalysis system to address this challenge and achieve efficient H2 generation and benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The photocatalytic component features a Re0.5Mo0.5S2 cocatalyst&#8208;modified MAPbI3 with efficient charge separation and ample active sites, achieving a remarkable H2 generation of 875.4 &#181;mol within 4 h through HI splitting. The subsequent electrocatalytic module can operate at a low potential (only 0.44 V to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2) to reduce the generated I3&#8208; and oxidize benzylamine to value&#8208;added chemicals. After the electrolysis, the regenerated HI solution can be recycled for subsequent photocatalytic H2 generation. The synergistic system establishes a sustainable catalytic cycle mediated by I&#8208;/I3&#8208; redox couples, enabling continuous photocatalytic H2 generation from HI splitting and energy&#8208;saving electrocatalytic benzylamine oxidative upgrading.</dc:description>

         <title>Impeding Thermal Atomization Enables Synthesizing Fe2N Cluster Liganded Single Fe&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anchoring a ligand, such as a functional group or a cluster, on the active metal center is an effective strategy for regulating the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we present a nitridation&#8208;induced&#8208;clustering strategy to produce not only SAC Fe&#8208;N4 in N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods, but also Fe2N cluster as a ligand anchored on the active Fe site (Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C). Unlike the conventional iron atomization process, the reactive nitridation process can generate thermodynamically stable Fe2N intermediates by nitriding the initially formed iron oxide, thereby impeding subsequent thermal atomization to fabricate Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Compared to the conventional SAC Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C with Fe&#8208;N4 active sites, the Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods are more active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yielding a record high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.957 V vs. RHE in alkali condition. The Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods can be utilized as air&#8208;cathode catalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries with a charge&#8208;discharge gap of only ~0.658 V and outstanding cyclability up to 1000 hours. Theoretical calculations show that the Fe2Nnc ligands indeed modified the electronic structure of Fe&#8208;N4 sites, leading to a lower adsorption energy for the ORR intermediate OH* and facilitating the desorption of OH* and thus higher activity for ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Planar Chiral Paracyclophanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic methods for the catalytic enantioselective preparation of planar chiral paracyclophane derivaties is of considerable interest to the synthetic community. To date, relatively few successful and effective organocatalytic approaches to this molecular class have been reported. In this context, this manuscript describes effective isothiourea catalysed acylative kinetic (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to the generation of a range of planar chiral macrocycles with excellent levels of enantioselectivity. Effective KR of configurationally stable planar chiral macrocyclic phenols with 12&#8208; and 13&#8208;membered ansa&#8208;chains is demonstrated (6 examples, s = up to 50) using 5 mol% of the isothiourea (R)&#8208;BTM and isobutyric anhydride. Application to configurationally labile macrocyclic phenols with 14 to 18 membered ansa&#8208;chains allows their effective acylative DKR, generating the desired products with excellent enantioselectivity (24 examples, up to 95% yield and 98:2 er).</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterating Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Semiconductors for Sensitive Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors exhibit significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies owing to their structural tunability and solution&#8208;processability, nevertheless as their bandgap decreases, the non&#8208;radiative recombination for either exciton or photogenerated charge&#8208;carriers increases, limiting short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photoresponse, as governed by energy gap law. Here, a deuteration strategy is employed to universally reduce the non&#8208;radiative decay pathways of SWIR organic semiconductors, enhancing photodetector sensitivity. Compared to protonated L4, the rational deuterated molecule (BT&#8208;12D) maintains SWIR photoresponse to ~1.7 &#956;m and exhibits lower stretching vibrational frequency (2350 cm&#8722;1 vs. 3063 cm&#8722;1), resulting in reduced recombination and 40%&#8208;increase in detectivity (D*) at 1.3 &#956;m for PDPPDTP: BT&#8208;12D&#8208;based organic photodetectors (OPDs). Likewise, deuterated L2&#8208;eC9&#8208;10D&#8208;based OPDs blending with PTB7&#8208;Th exhibit 14% higher D* (1.24&#215;1012 Jones at 1.2 &#181;m) and faster rise/fall time (1.0/1.2 &#956;s) than protonated devices (1.09&#215;1012 Jones; 1.6/1.7 &#956;s). The optimized D* of deuterated OPDs is comparable to and even better than those of commercial detectors at 0.9&#8208;1.2 &#956;m, while the corresponding response time is the fastest value reported for SWIR OPDs. These results highlight the broad applicability of deuteration as an effective strategy to suppress non&#8208;radiative decay pathways in SWIR organic semiconductors, unlocking new opportunities for sensitive SWIR optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first enantioselective total synthesis of the antiproliferative natural product (&#8211;)&#8208;psiguadial A is reported.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Promoted C&#8208;C Coupling for Selective Methane Conversion into Ethane on Cerium Oxide Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting methane into high&#8208;value chemicals under mild conditions offers substantial environmental and energy benefits but is challenged by the difficulty of activating C&#8211;H bonds and preventing over&#8208;oxidation. In this study, the pivotal role of hydroxyl&#8208;rich surfaces on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is demonstrated in directing selective C&#8211;C coupling of methane. These surface hydroxyls not only enhance methane chemisorption and improve charge separation, but also promote favorable interactions with molecular oxygen, collectively boosting catalytic performance. Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups lower the energy barrier for ethane formation while suppressing its over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, resulting in significantly improved selectivity. Under ambient conditions in a flow&#8208;reactor system, the catalyst achieves a continuous ethane production rate of 187 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with approximately 97% selectivity over an extended operation period (&gt;200 h), surpassing previous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems. This work provides critical insights into the role of hydroxyl&#8208;modified local environment in methane valorization, paving the way for the development of sustainable and efficient catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Cycloaddition for the Construction of Chiral Indole&#8208;Fused Medium&#8208; and Large&#8208;Sized Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings represents an important issue in synthetic chemistry but with significant challenges. To overcome these challenges, herein, we report highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings via organocatalytic asymmetric (4+4) and (4+4+m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates with benzofuranyl azadienes, providing an efficient strategy for accessing these enantioenriched frameworks. By designing 2&#8208;indolylacetates as a new class of four&#8208;carbon platform molecules for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and modulating the nucleophilicity of benzofuranyl azadienes, we achieved the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral indole&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered rings and eleven&#8208; to fourteen&#8208;membered macrocycles in high yields with good enantioselectivity. This work not only demonstrates the first application of 2&#8208;indolylacetates as four&#8208;carbon platform molecules in cycloaddition reactions, but also represents the first catalytic asymmetric (4+4) and (4+4+m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates.&#160;Furthermore, biological evaluation revealed that several chiral indole derivatives exhibit&#160;some extent of antitumor activity, indicating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Divergent Hydroboration/Multiboration of Terminal Alkynes via Markovnikov Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free and Markovnikov&#8208;type process for divergent hydroboration/multiboration of terminal alkynes has been achieved, enabling the transformation of diverse aryl and alkyl alkynes into valuable but previously inaccessible &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronate, 2,2&#8208;diborylalkane, 1,2,2&#8208;triborylalkane, and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkane with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities by simply modulating the proton additive and solvent.








Abstract
Hydroboration/multiboration of alkynes has been considered a straightforward route for the construction of high&#8208;value alkenylboronates and multiborylalkanes, especially reflected by the productions of &#946;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes based on the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type transformations of terminal alkyne. However, the syntheses of branched &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes remain elusive due to the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable Markovnikov hydroboration process. Herein, we present a conceptually novel metal&#8208;free approach for Markovnikov hydroboration of terminal alkynes to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates. Derived from it, we have successfully realized unprecedented tailor&#8208;made multiborations (2,2&#8208;dihydroboration, 1,2,2&#8208;triboration, and 1,2&#8208;dihydroboration) of alkynes by simply changing the proton sources and solvents. The broad substrate scope and outstanding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of the developed approaches unlock opportunities to exploit these formerly unattainable organoboronates, thereby expanding uncharted chemical space. The preliminary mechanistic studies highlight the synergistic roles of amide solvents, suitable proton sources, and B2cat2 in facilitating these tunable transformations.

         <title>A Heterodimeric Cluster&#8208;Based Pair Catalyst for Electrochemical Synthesis of Cyclohexanone Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a design strategy for constructing the unique proximity of the two active sites severally from metal cluster and polyoxotitanium cluster, thereby combining the functions of two cluster monomers into one catalyst to achieve highly catalytic activity while simultaneously increasing the target product selectivity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are complex chemical ecosystems, where various functional units execute their individual responsibilities to together complete a catalysis ensemble. Here, we report a dinuclear catalyst originated from two molecular&#8208;purity monomers including an atomically precise Ag4Pd2(SR)8 cluster and a polyoxotitanium Ti4O2(TBC[4])2(iPrO)4 cluster that are eventually paired off by the bridging sulfur. The heterodimeric catalyst with a unique interface consisted of the Ti&#9472;S&#9472;metal (metal&#160;=&#160;Pd and Ag) motifs exhibits selective recognition for nitrogen sources, thereby achieving high performances for the electrochemical synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime. The nitrate is favorably deoxygenated on the metal sites to generate nitrite, followed by the flipping of nitrite at the Ti&#9472;S&#9472;metal interface and the stepwise reduction of nitrite on the Ti site to produce hydroxylamine. Sequentially, a spontaneous coupling from hydroxylamine and cyclohexanone proceeds to construct the C&#9552;N bond for cyclohexanone oxime. Using this combination of distinct functional modules into one catalyst, we develop a strategy for heterogeneous catalysts being designed to increase the substrate conversion while simultaneously increasing the target product selectivity.

         <title>Silylchromium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Semihydrogenation of Undirected Allenes by Sila&#8208;Metalation and &#946;&#8208;Silyl Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted allenes without a directing group underwent chromium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and regioselective semihydrogenation with an (alkyl)(amino)carbene&#8208;phosphine ligand and a chlorosilane additive. The silylchromium complex formed in situ promotes semihydrogenation through a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of the allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination, with the silyl group acting as a noninnocent ligand to give E&#8208;alkene products selectively. 








Abstract
The semihydrogenation of simple allenes remains an issue because of the difficulty in controlling of selectivity without coordination assistance from directing groups, wherein over&#8208;hydrogenated alkanes and E/Z&#8208;mixed stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;isomers can be potentially formed. We report here an electron&#8208;rich cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;phosphine&#8208;ligated chromium(III) complex serving as precatalyst in promoting the selective semihydrogenation of undirected allenes by forming active silylchromium species. The semihydrogenation allows the selective addition of H2 to the less substituted and electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted C&#9552;C bonds of allenes while enabling the suppression of competitive over&#8208;hydrogenation, proving generally to form trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenes in high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity.

     alt="Silylchromium-Catalyzed Selective Semihydrogenation of Undirected Allenes by Sila-Metalation and &#946;-Silyl Elimination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substituted allenes without a directing group underwent chromium-catalyzed chemo-, stereo-, and regioselective semihydrogenation with an (alkyl)(amino)carbene-phosphine ligand and a chlorosilane additive. The silylchromium complex formed in situ promotes semihydrogenation through a pathway involving sila-metalation of the allene and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-silyl elimination, with the silyl group acting as a noninnocent ligand to give &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-alkene products selectively. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semihydrogenation of simple allenes remains an issue because of the difficulty in controlling of selectivity without coordination assistance from directing groups, wherein over-hydrogenated alkanes and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-mixed stereo- and regio-isomers can be potentially formed. We report here an electron-rich cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)-phosphine-ligated chromium(III) complex serving as precatalyst in promoting the selective semihydrogenation of undirected allenes by forming active silylchromium species. The semihydrogenation allows the selective addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the less substituted and electron-rich alkyl-substituted C&#9552;C bonds of allenes while enabling the suppression of competitive over-hydrogenation, proving generally to form trisubstituted &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes in high chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity. By this CAAC-phosphine-Cr-catalyzed selective semihydrogenation, unsaturated nitro, nitrile, alkenyl, and hydrogenation-sensitive bromide, chloride, and fluoride were compatible with various substitution environments. The in situ forming silylchromium as active catalyst by reaction of low-valent chromium complex with chlorosilane was established by studying the catalytic and stoichiometric reactivity of this species in the semihydrogenation. Deuterium labeling experiments, HRMS, XPS, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility analysis of the related intermediates and theoretical studies support a pathway involving sila-metalation of allene and &#946;-silyl elimination processes with silyl as noninnocent ligand, leading to the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-alkene products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Diazatriptycene Exhibiting Acid&#8208;Induced Ternary Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching and Crystal Morphology Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) control, including on/off and +/&#8722; switching was achieved by chiral double N&#8208;doping of the triptycene system. Dramatic crystal morphology changes, including a herringbone, trimer cluster, chiral porous tube, and 2D charge&#8208;segregated array, were also observed when using an acidic medium, which showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement CPL (AIEE&#8208;CPL).








Abstract
Doubly N&#8208;doped triptycene 2,6&#8208;diazatriptycene 1 was synthesized as the first example of triptycene&#8208;bearing intrinsic chirality in its core. The resolved enantiomers exhibited an acid&#8208;induced ternary circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switching behavior, enabling on/off and +/&#8722; control, with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of approximately 10&#8722;3. Density functional theory calculations indicated that these ternary CPL changes were derived from modulation of through&#8208;space conjugation within the triptycene skeleton. In addition, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 and the salt 1&#8226;(TfOH)n revealed the presence of herringbone arrangements, trimer clusters, chiral porous tubes, and 2D charge&#8208;segregated array structures. These results demonstrate that precise change of the molecular assembly can be achieved using N&#8208;doped chiral triptycene facilitated by ionic hydrogen bonding and donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Lipid Nanosonosensitizers with Size Reduction and NO Release: Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer (IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO) has been developed, allowing to reduce nanoparticle size, release nitric oxide and irinotecan, and generate reactive oxygen species for tumor microenvironment remodeling and synergetic sonodynamic&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer under sequential low&#8208;power and high&#8208;power ultrasound irradiation.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains difficult to treat due to its dense extracellular matrix (ECM), immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and deep&#8208;seated anatomy. To address these challenges, we developed IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer that synergizes sonodynamic therapy (SDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for orthotopic PC. IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO undergoes three key US&#8208;activated responses: 1) size reduction, 2) controlled release of irinotecan (IR) and nitric oxide (NO), and 3) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under low&#8208;dose US, IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO reduces in size (from &#8764;120&#160; to &#8764;40&#160;nm), enhancing tumor penetration, and releases NO to remodel the TME by normalizing vasculature and degrading ECM. This enhances nanosonosensitizers accumulation and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) infiltration. High&#8208;dose US irradiation triggers the generation of cytotoxic ROS, which, in combination with IR&#8208;mediated chemotherapy, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and enhances antitumor immunity. Additionally, combining IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO with PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) immunotherapy significantly prolongs survival in orthotopic PC models. The cascade strategy&#8212;size reduction, TME remodeling, and multimodal therapy&#8212;effectively overcomes stromal and immunosuppressive barriers, offering a robust platform for treating deep&#8208;seated PC.

         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;driven selective activation of hydroxyl &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds strategy facilitates efficient photoinduced alcohol dehydrogenation via a bifunctional HAT catalyst. The approach achieves precise control over single or multiple consecutive dehydrogenation events in polyhydroxy compounds and offers late&#8208;stage functionalization capabilities, providing a promising pathway for pharmaceutical synthesis and drug development.








Abstract
The transformation of alcohols into corresponding carbonyl derivatives is of paramount importance for the construction of complex molecules. Current strategies for catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols were predominantly confined to reactive alcohols, such as benzyl or allyl alcohols, due to the relatively high &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bond dissociation energy of the conventional unreactive alcohols. Notably, weak bond catalysis, particularly hydrogen bonding, can selectively activate C&#9472;H bonds by modulating the distribution of electron density. Herein, we have developed a dual&#8208;catalysis platform that enabled highly efficient oxidation of alcohols promoted by a multifunctional catalyst. This strategy achieves selective activation of the hydroxyl &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via hydrogen bonding interactions and polarity matching, which is compatible with both primary and secondary alcohols, demonstrating potential applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. Moreover, DFT studies provide compelling evidence that hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions between 3&#8208;quinuclidinone and alcohols play a pivotal role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

The strategic extension of branched alkyl chain length in double protonated cation systems represents a promising approach for enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and tailoring multi&#8208;functional luminescent materials. These optimized materials demonstrate versatile application potential in temperature&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information encryption, solid&#8208;state&#8208;lighting devices, and X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (Mn&#8208;based OIMHs) scintillators have aroused a research upsurge due to their outstanding photoluminescence performance, low toxicity, and tunable structures. Herein, we demonstrate a molecular engineering strategy that synergistically enhances luminescence efficiency and radiation sensitivity by systematic elongation of branched alkyl chains in phosphonium&#8208;based cations. The (4&#8208;DEATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DEATBP = (4&#8208;(diethylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) crystal exhibits remarkable thermochromic luminescence properties and anti&#8208;thermal quenching effect, highlighting the application potential in high&#8208;temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. Through effective chain elongation, the (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DBATBP = (4&#8208;(dibutylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) single crystal achieves an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100% and exhibits superior performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation, with a high light yield of 67953 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10.45 nGy s&#8722;1. Additionally, the glassy (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 25 lp mm&#8722;1. (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 shows great application potential in the fields of white light&#8208;emitting diode (WLED) and express security check due to its outstanding luminescence performance. This work not only offers two kinds of new Mn&#8208;based OIMH materials but also authenticates the role of extending the branched alkyl chain for improving the photoluminescence performance.

Through effective chain elongation, the (4-DBATBP)MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (4-DBATBP = (4-(dibutylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) single crystal achieves an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100% and exhibits superior performance under X-ray irradiation, with a high light yield of 67953 photons MeV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10.45 nGy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the glassy (4-DBATBP)MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 25 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. (4-DBATBP)MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; shows great application potential in the fields of white light-emitting diode (WLED) and express security check due to its outstanding luminescence performance. This work not only offers two kinds of new Mn-based OIMH materials but also authenticates the role of extending the branched alkyl chain for improving the photoluminescence performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking as Electron&#8208;Transfer Channels in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with similar structures but slightly different intermolecular interactions have been generated. The HOF with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions shows much higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution than the one without, thereby highlighting &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as an electron&#8208;transfer channel in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalysis provides a promising approach to produce green energy, by which the intermittent solar energy can be converted into storable chemical energy. It is well&#8208;known that the electron&#8208;transfer rate has great influence on the photocatalytic efficiency. Revealing the influence of electron&#8208;transfer rate on the photocatalytic efficiency from a molecular level is of great significance but a challenge. Herein, we give solid evidence to show that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking can serve as an electron&#8208;transfer channel to boost photocatalysis. Specifically, two hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with similar structures but slightly different intermolecular interactions have been weaved. Interestingly, the HOF with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions shows much higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution than the one without. Further structural and spectroscopic analyses revealed that the much&#8208;enhanced photocatalytic activity of the former can be attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which can really serve as an electron&#8208;transfer channel, thus accelerating the electron transfer and achieving a remarkably enhanced activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The work, from a molecular level, reveals the role of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in photocatalysis and gives new insights into the electron&#8208;transfer in photocatalysts.

         <title>Nitramine Formation via a Cryptic Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetase&#8208;Dependent Strategy in N&#8208;Nitroglycine Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of the N&#8208;nitration, oxidation of hydrazine and hydrazone is involved in N&#8208;nitroglycine biosynthesis to form the nitramine structure. In vivo and in vitro results indicated the N&#8208;nitroglycine biosynthetic pathway involves serine incorporation induced by NRPS, and a nonheme diiron N&#8208;oxygenase and a cytochrome P450s as the pivotal oxidative enzymes responsible for nitramine formation.








Abstract
N&#8208;nitroglycine (NNG), a rare nitramine natural compound, is the only known example produced by streptomyces strains. In this study, we clarified that NNG biosynthesis originates from glycine and l&#8208;lysine and elucidated its biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) nng. This cluster shares high homology with the recently reported BGCs of diazo compound azaserine. In vivo and in vitro results have indicated NNG biosynthetic pathway involves hydrazine and hydrazone generation, with a non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenase and a cytochrome P450 responsible for forming the nitramine structure. Furthermore, although NNG lacks a serine unit in the structure, its biosynthesis still requires the incorporation of a serine attached to the hydrazone intermediate by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), similar to the azaserine pathway, and two hydrolases are putatively involved in thioester hydrolysis and serine removal, respectively. This study, along with comparisons to azaserine biosynthesis, not only paves the way for the discovery of new nitramine and diazo compounds by genome mining but also highlights the potential for uncovering novel enzymes and chemistry involved in hydrazone oxidation.

         <title>Achieving Uniform Phase Structure for Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Binary Organic Solar Cells with 20.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique 3D nanomorphology is achieved and uncovered within LBL&#8208;processed active layer, which highlights a highly uniform and &#8220;zigzag&#8221;&#8208;shaped phase structure in the middle&#8208;depth layer, in strong contrast with relatively disordered phase structure of conventional blend casting films. An impressive PCE of 20.2% is obtained in the LBL&#8208;processed binary devices, owing to the efficient charge separation and transport and suppressed recombination loss.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition has become a facile and promising method to fabricate highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). However, characterization and optimization of 3D morphology remain a grand challenge for LBL&#8208;processed active layers, and their correlation with photovoltaic properties of OSC devices is not clear to date. Here, to address this issue, the morphology and its formation mechanisms of LBL&#8208;processed active layer based on the classical D18/L8&#8208;BO blend were investigated systematically. Intriguingly, a unique 3D nanomorphology is achieved and uncovered within the LBL processed active layer, which highlights a highly uniform and &#8220;zigzag&#8221;&#8208;shaped phase structure formed by the intersection of donor and acceptor aggregates along horizontal direction in the middle&#8208;depth layer, rarely found in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films processed by blend casting. Our results revealed that solid additive DBM with a twisted conformation plays a crucial role in achieving the uniform phase structure of LBL&#8208;deposited active layer. Consequently, the characteristic 3D morphology of LBL&#8208;processed device significantly improves short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, enabling an impressive PCE of 20.2% in such binary device. Therefore, this work unambiguously demonstrates a unique 3D nanomorphology within LBL active layer, unveils the morphology manipulation mechanism, and their correlation with optoelectronic properties of OSCs.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Covalent Knoevenagel/Hydrazide Condensation for Polyacylhydrazones and Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst&#8208;free dynamic covalent condensation reaction between Knoevenagel derivatives and hydrazides, which exhibits a broad substituent&#8208;dependent Keq range (0.1 to 719). These interesting features drive us to develop dynamic polymers: 1) high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass (&#8722;180&#160;kDa) polyacylhydrazones with favorable mechanical properties were synthesized; 2) catalyst&#8208;free covalent adaptable networks with remarkably rapid stress relaxation (38&#160;s at 160&#160;&#176;C) and excellent mechanical performance were prepared.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) has significantly impacted both chemistry and materials science. There is an increasing need for exploring catalyst&#8208;free dynamic covalent reactions with large equilibrium constant (Keq) ranges to provide new avenues for the tailored design of dynamic polymers. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free dynamic covalent condensation reaction between Knoevenagel derivatives (Kn)&#160;and hydrazides to generate acylhydrazones. Systematic small&#8208;molecule studies validate a significant substituent effect on the Kn reactant, resulting in a wide Keq range covering nearly four orders of magnitude (0.1&#8211;719). The high Keq values (&gt;500) achieved in polar aprotic solvents enable the catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass (&#8722;180&#160;kDa) polyacylhydrazones. The retention of by&#8208;products during polycondensation leads to concentration&#8208;dependent topology switching between polymeric and macrocyclic acylhydrazones. By leveraging this reaction, we developed a novel covalent adaptable network (CAN) that exhibits remarkable stress relaxation properties (38&#160;s at 160&#160;&#176;C), facilitating efficient thermal reprocessing while maintaining high mechanical performance. This condensation reaction enriches the dynamic covalent toolbox and offers a versatile approach for the design and fabrication of dynamic polymers with tailored mechanical and dynamic behavior.

         <title>Promoting the Intermediates Hydrogenation for Urea Electrosynthesis Over an &#8220;Active Hydrogen Pump&#8221; Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu3Mo2O9 nanorods was developed to serve as &#8220;active hydrogen pump&#8221; electrocatalyst, which could regulate the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption. Such electrocatalyst would guarantee a steady *H supply for intermediates hydrogenation, hence boosting the generation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates for selective C&#9472;N coupling and urea production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic coupling of CO2 and NO3&#8722; offers a sustainable approach for urea production. However, the limited supply of active hydrogen (*H) hinders the formation of the key carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates, thus impeding the selective C&#9472;N coupling. Herein, we developed copper molybdate (Cu3Mo2O9) nanorods, which could serve as &#8220;active hydrogen pump&#8221; catalysts by regulating the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption. Such electrocatalyst would guarantee a steady *H supply for intermediates hydrogenation, hence boosting the generation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates for selective C&#8210;N coupling and urea production. In a CO2&#8208;saturated 0.1&#160;M KNO3 solution, Cu3Mo2O9 achieved a maximum urea yield rate of 177&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 with a urea&#8208;producing FE of 40% in a flow cell configuration, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. This study underscores the crucial role of *H, which may guide the exploration of advanced catalysts for expediting the sustainable synthesis of indispensable chemicals requiring rapid intermediates hydrogenation.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Lipid Metabolism Dynamics in Physiological/Pathological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probe was developed for the selective targeting of lipid droplets, enabling precise visualization and quantification of lipid metabolism disorders using an integrated STED&#8208;FLIM platform. This probe allows accurate monitoring of lipid metabolism in cellular and pathological contexts, such as atherosclerosis, providing insights for diagnosis, and targeted therapy development.








Abstract
Dysregulated lipid metabolism plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. However, due to the lack of effective solutions, the dynamic monitoring and deep understanding of lipid metabolism in those disease progression has remained challenging. Herein, a polarity&#8208;sensitive, lipid droplets (LDs)&#8208;targeted probe was developed for spatiotemporal super&#8208;resolution imaging of lipid metabolism dynamics. Based on the stimulated emission depletion (STED) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) platform, we achieved the super&#8208;resolution visualization and dynamic tracking of the nonlinear fusion and expansion mechanisms of LDs in orthotopic pathology models&#8212;an unprecedented achievement in the field. We also analyzed lipid distribution in zebrafish models using the STED&#8208;FLIM platform to capture lipid metabolism at the organismal level. Crucially, based on the integrated STED&#8208;FLIM platform, this probe accurately monitors lipid metabolism in cellular and pathological tissue contexts of atherosclerosis and fatty liver. This breakthrough provides novel insights for diagnosing lipid metabolism&#8208;related diseases and advancing therapeutic development.

         <title>Production of H2O2 via Energy Transfer Photocatalysis by Coupling with Furfuryl Alcohol Conversion over an Amide&#8208;Functionalized Heptazine Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;based photocatalysis can be switched to a novel energy transfer route for efficient and selective 1O2 generation through amide functionalization to modulate the electronic structure of the photocatalyst, thus providing a promising approach for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction provides a sustainable approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the charge carrier&#8208;based pathway is severely limited by inefficient charge separation and redox decomposition of the produced H2O2. Energy transfer photocatalysis (EnTP) is an alternative charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;free route for H2O2 synthesis. Herein, we propose a strategy of killing two birds with one stone to simultaneously realize the synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative by coupling EnTP with the Achmatowicz reaction. Results show efficient production of H2O2 at a rate of 14.6&#8201;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1&#160;and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 44.1% at 420&#8201;nm, coupled with the conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfuryl alcohol (FFA) into hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;3(6H)&#8208;one with a high selectivity of 85.9%. Such a performance was attributed to the efficient EnTP over the amide&#8208;functionalized heptazine framework photocatalyst for singlet oxygen generation, which induces the FFA conversion and concurrently produces H2O2. A systematic study of the photoexcitation process of the catalysts reveals that the amide functionalization significantly improves the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency, as the structural modification optimizes the electronic structure and thus tunes the composition and distribution of energy bands.

         <title>Modular Access to Fluorinated Quaternary Stereocenters via Palladium/Lewis Base Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synergistic Pd/AxBTM catalytic system that enables stereoselective C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) coupling between &#945;&#8208;fluoro acetates and allenes/dienes, establishing an efficient platform for constructing challenging fluorinated quaternary stereocenters. Through strategic catalyst modulation, this methodology achieves stereodivergent synthesis of all four possible fluorinated vicinal stereoisomers, demonstrating unprecedented control over 3D fluorinated space in acyclic molecular frameworks.








Abstract
The stereocontrolled construction of fluorinated quaternary stereocenters in acyclic systems remains a significant synthetic challenge. We report a synergistic palladium/Lewis base catalytic platform that directly couples &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl acetates with allenes or 1,3&#8208;dienes without directing groups. This strategy overcomes traditional limitations in fluoronucleophile activation and stereochemical control, enabling access to diverse acyclic fluorinated architectures. Key to success is the use of axial&#8208;chiral Lewis bases, which work cooperatively with palladium catalysts to govern both enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The method accommodates broad substrate scope, including aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic systems, while demonstrating scalability and synthetic versatility through downstream transformations. This work not only bridges essential voids in fluorinated stereochemical space but also enhances the practical applications of synergistic catalyst systems.

         <title>In Situ Proton&#8208;Feeding Retards the Deprotonation for Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ proton&#8208;feeding strategy is devised to restrain the deprotonation process in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites by introducing a proton&#8208;rich Lewis base&#8208;trifluoromethyl nicotinic acid. The TFNA&#8208;treated films exhibit high fluorescence quantum yield and excellent crystal structural stability. The resulting red&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 27.5% and maximum luminance of 3034&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have shown great potential in the application of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their large exciton binding energy, tunable bandgaps, and solution processability. However, the heavily used spacer cations will cause serious deprotonation reactions in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, leading to lattice collapse and abundant defect states, which are notorious for fabricating efficient perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Herein, we develop an in situ proton&#8208;feeding strategy to restrain the deprotonation process in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites by introducing a proton&#8208;rich Lewis base, namely trifluoromethyl nicotinic acid (TFNA), into the perovskite precursor solutions. The TFNA molecules can donate protons during the growth of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films to simultaneously compensate the deprotonated spacer cations, passivate the defects states by coordinating with Pb2+, and improve structural stability by forming hydrogen bonds with organic spacers. This leads to an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 78.8%. The resulting red&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 27.5% at 660&#160;nm, accompanied by a 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement of the operational lifetime (T50) compared to that of the reference device based on pristine perovskite. This work deepens the understanding of the crystallization of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films and provides a new avenue to improve the PeLEDs performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites have shown great potential in the application of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their large exciton binding energy, tunable bandgaps, and solution processability. However, the heavily used spacer cations will cause serious deprotonation reactions in quasi-2D perovskite films, leading to lattice collapse and abundant defect states, which are notorious for fabricating efficient perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Herein, we develop an in situ proton-feeding strategy to restrain the deprotonation process in quasi-2D perovskites by introducing a proton-rich Lewis base, namely trifluoromethyl nicotinic acid (TFNA), into the perovskite precursor solutions. The TFNA molecules can donate protons during the growth of quasi-2D perovskite films to simultaneously compensate the deprotonated spacer cations, passivate the defects states by coordinating with Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and improve structural stability by forming hydrogen bonds with organic spacers. This leads to an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 78.8%. The resulting red-emitting quasi-2D PeLEDs achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 27.5% at 660&#160;nm, accompanied by a 3.5-fold enhancement of the operational lifetime (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) compared to that of the reference device based on pristine perovskite. This work deepens the understanding of the crystallization of quasi-2D perovskite films and provides a new avenue to improve the PeLEDs performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Urea&#8208;Based Units Into Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Artemisinin Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function covalent organic framework (COF) with large channels and high surface area has been designed and synthesized. Integration of porphyrin macrocycles and urea groups into the porous framework enables the prepared COF to exhibit excellent heterogeneous photocatalytic activity toward the photosynthesis of artemisinin in the absence of strong acids with high conversion rate, high yield, and excellent recoverability.








Abstract
Artemisinin and its derivatives are the most efficacious treatment for malaria, and the artificial synthesis of artemisinin supplies a promising method to satisfy market demand. However, conventional artemisinin preparation via homogeneous photo/acid&#8208;catalytic reactions usually suffers from the difficulty in recycling the photo/acid&#8208;catalysts and treating waste acid. Consequently, it is still highly urgent for developing environment&#8208;friendly and effective artificial preparation methods for artemisinin. Herein, a dual&#8208;function covalent organic framework (COF), named Urea&#8208;COF, has been synthesized from the condensation of meso&#8208;tetra(p&#8208;formylphenyl)porphyrin with 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)urea. UreaCOF exhibits a high surface area of 1732 m2 g&#8722;1 with a large pore size of 3.1&#160;nm, enabling a fast mass transport and high accessibility of urea groups. The urea groups as hydrogen bond donor catalytic sites bind strongly to the carboxylic acid to release H+, thereby increasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid. This, in combination with the exceptional capacity of porphyrin macrocycles to generate singlet oxygen, endows Urea&#8208;COF with excellent heterogeneous photocatalytic activity toward tandem semisynthesis of artemisinin from dihydroartemisinic acid in a high conversion rate (99%) and yield (71%) without additional acid, superior to all the thus far reported homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Lewis Acidity of the SbCl3/o&#8208;chloranil System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An SbCl5 surrogate from easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents! The putative SbCl3(o&#8208;C6O2Cl4) synthon is calculated to be more Lewis acidic than SbCl5. Even if endergonic, its formation from SbCl3 and o&#8208;chloranil can be driven by Lewis base coordination, leading to the corresponding adducts. The involvement of this powerful Lewis acid is also implicated in various reactions promoted by the SbCl3/o&#8208;chloranil system, including C&#9472;F bond activation.








Abstract
While SbCl3 is typically inert toward oxidation by ortho&#8208;quinones, we use o&#8208;chloranil to show that the outcome of such reactions may be altered by the presence of a donor such as triphenylphosphine oxide, which readily traps the SbCl3(catCl) synthon (catCl&#160;=&#160;tetrachlorocatecholate) in the form of the corresponding adduct Ph3PO&#8594;SbCl3(catCl). The same reaction in the presence of a chloride salt affords the corresponding antimonate anion [Cl4Sb(catCl)]&#8722;. Computational studies indicate that the putative SbCl3(catCl) synthon has a higher chloride ion affinity than SbCl5, suggesting significant Lewis acidity. This property is further demonstrated by the use of the SbCl3/o&#8208;chloranil system for both THF polymerization and a Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type alkylation of benzene using 1&#8208;fluorooctane. Finally, the reaction of E&#8208;stilbene with o&#8208;chloranil in the presence of SbCl3 affords the corresponding benzodioxene, suggesting that SbCl3 may also operate as a redox&#8208;active catalyst.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Synthesis of a Rope&#8208;Ladder Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction of a designed monomer yields a structurally perfect rope&#8208;ladder polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) manner. The polymerization happens step&#8208;wise, first forming a topochemical cocrystal intermediate which consists of the monomer and dimer in a 1:1 ratio. A dimerization event triggers the polymerization, connecting the stiles via robust 1,5&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linkages.








Abstract
Here, we report a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) synthesis of a fully organic ladder polymer via a topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. A designed monomer featuring a rigid benzene core with flexible peptide&#8208;linked azide and alkyne groups crystallized with three conformers in the asymmetric unit, as evidenced by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Hydrogen bonding between the amino acid residues facilitates the organization of the monomer in a reactive geometry with inter&#8208;conformer azide&#8208;alkyne end&#8208;to&#8208;end distances within Schmidt's criteria. Upon thermal activation, two of the three monomer&#8208;conformers reacted to form a dimer, leading to an intermediate 1:1 cocrystal of monomer and dimer. The intermediate cocrystal reacted further, forming a structurally perfect ladder polymer in an SCSC manner. SCXRD analysis confirmed the regiospecificity of the reaction yielding 1,5&#8208;triazolyl linkages in both the intermediate dimer and the polymer. The polymerization process was also studied by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR). This study demonstrates the scope of topochemical polymerization strategies to synthesize architecturally attractive crystalline polymers that enable precise structural elucidation.

         <title>Precise Control of Active Site Configurations in High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeCoNiSbGe high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds, featuring an ordered atomic arrangement and precise atomic positions, offer well&#8208;defined active site configurations. During the nitrate reduction reaction, Fe and Ni atoms synergistically optimize the electronic structure of Co sites, delivering an exceptional NH3 yield rate of 7.5&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.40&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and achieving a maximum faradaic efficiency of 97.6%.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), composed of five or more elements in similar proportions, exhibit unique physicochemical properties, but their disordered atomic structures pose challenges in the precise control of active sites. In contrast, high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds (HEIs), with an ordered atomic arrangement and well&#8208;defined atomic positions, provide clear active site configurations, making them particularly advantageous for complex electrocatalytic reactions like the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Herein, we present the FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI with precisely controlled elemental distributions, leading to the formation of distinct active sites. The FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI catalyst exhibits high activity for NO3RR, achieving a high NH3 yield rate of 7.5&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.6% at &#8722;0.30&#160;V, along with excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that Co sites act as key active sites, whereas Fe and Ni atoms contribute a synergistic effect. Additionally, the FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI catalyst functions in a bifunctional system coupling NH3 production with the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), achieving an NH3 yield of 9.8&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 1.8&#160;V, maintaining stable performance for 100 h.

         <dc:description>
The air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable Ni(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] is obtained via a unique in&#8208;situ reduction and fluorination mechanism from [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 and Ph2P(&#9552;O)&#9472;PPh2, incorporating typically unstable fluorophosphine ligands. In their Research Article (e202506271), Schirin Hanf et al. demonstrated its utility as a robust Ni(0) source, and showed its superior catalytic activity in coupling reactions compared to the conventional [Ni(COD)2].

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Optimizing the Selectivity of CH4 Electrosynthesis from CO2 over Cuprates through Cu&#9472;O Bond Length Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202503745), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report a selectivity descriptor based on Cu&#9472;O bond length for screening highly selective cuprates toward CH4 electrosynthesis. This descriptor reveals that CH4 selectivity exhibits a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation with the Cu&#9472;O bond length, with the optimal value accessible at &#8764;1.951&#160;&#197;. Using this descriptor, three new cuprates are predicted, demonstrating better performance compared to the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts in acidic electrolytes.

The cover artwork, designed by Helen Allmendinger, visualizes a novel synthetic pathway and the first crystallographic characterization of the [cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; anion in the solid state. Although this compound is spectroscopically known since the 1980s it was so far prepared and handled only in solution. By complexing the alkali metal cation with [2.2.2]cryptand, the resulting salts of the [cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; are found to be surprisingly stable in the solid state as reported by Christian M&#252;ller et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202505853).

         <title>Intramolecular Switching Oxygen Reduction Reaction Driven by Dual&#8208;Crystalline Bimetallic MOF induces Self&#8208;Potential&#8208;Resolved Electrochemiluminescence Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnRuMOF structure, with its precise bimetallic configuration, has been shown to exhibit efficient autocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the production of different ROS. This, in turn, results in dual&#8208;signal luminescence without the need for additional co&#8208;reactants and catalyst. Further modification of the ZnRuMOF structure and application of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (Pt&#8208;N&#8208;SACs) to switch the cathode&#8211;anode signal make it possible to successfully construct an ECL ratio biosensor, providing a new strategy for a single emitter with dual&#8208;signal luminescence green efficient biosensors. 








Abstract
Framework materials, particularly metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have emerged as versatile platforms for multifunctional applications due to their tunable structures and properties. In this study, a series of bimetallic ZnRuMOFs with dual&#8208;crystalline phase structure was designed and synthesized. This unique dual&#8208;crystalline bimetallic MOF configuration enables intramolecular autocatalysis and selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By utilizing endogenous dissolved O2 as a green co&#8208;reactant, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)&#8208;coupled ORR system with potential&#8208;resolving capability was developed. Experimental results, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, elucidated the ability of MOFs with different phase structures to catalyze specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the mechanism of ECL luminescence mediated by intramolecular autocatalysis using ZnRuMOF as the luminophore. The selectively generated ROS function as intramolecular coreactants, reducing radical transfer losses and significantly enhancing ECL stability. Leveraging these findings, a novel potentiometrically resolved ECL biosensor for the cardiovascular disease biomarker microRNA 24 was constructed. The biosensor integrates ROS&#8208;mediated intramolecular modulation with a platinum single&#8208;atom catalysts (Pt&#8208;N&#8208;SAC). This study demonstrates that precise modulation of MOF structures reveals distinct catalytic properties associated with different MOF configurations, offering a new strategy for the development of simple yet efficient monoluminescent ECL systems.

         <title>Quaternary Phosphonium Salts Enable Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative C&#8722;H Activation of Aminophosphines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quaternary phosphonium salts, despite their extensive historical study, have remained unexplored as key additives in transition metal catalysis until our current investigation. Here, we present a groundbreaking palladium&#8208;catalyzed system for P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation of aminophosphines, followed by annulation with alkynes. By utilizing P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphines, we have achieved the stereospecific synthesis of chiral phosphacycles. This innovative process, facilitated by deprotonative isomerization, efficiently yields a wide range of P&#8208;heterocycles. The pivotal breakthrough of our methodology lies in the identification of phosphonium salts as effective additives, which undertake multiple functions: they not only reduce the energy barrier of pivotal steps but also regenerate the palladium catalyst while safeguarding the P(III) directing group from oxidation. Through systematic experimental investigations, particularly by comparing transition states with and without quaternary phosphonium salts, we have elucidated the unique reaction pathway, thereby explaining the critical role of the salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogenized Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly improved, driven by advancements in self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs). However, achieving homogeneous SAM coverage on substrates remains challenging, directly impacting device performance and stability. Here, we present (4&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (PhPAPy), a SAM with a rigid aromatic ring structure. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that this rigidity limits rotational freedom, promoting a near&#8208;vertical molecular orientation on the substrate. Additionally, &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between the planar pyrene rings enhance molecular packing, forming a homogeneous and dense SAM layer. As a result, the uniform PhPAPy effectively minimizes perovskite&#8208;substrate direct contact, enhance the interfacial properties, reduces buried interface defects, and improves both efficiency and stability. With PhPAPy SAM, the assembled inverted PSCs achieve a certified reverse&#8208;scanning power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.74% and a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 26.12% (from National Institute of Metrology in China). These devices retain 95% of their initial efficiency after 2,000 hours of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5G illumination at 65 &#176;C and ambient humidity (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).</dc:description>

As a result, the uniform PhPAPy effectively minimizes perovskite-substrate direct contact, enhance the interfacial properties, reduces buried interface defects, and improves both efficiency and stability. With PhPAPy SAM, the assembled inverted PSCs achieve a certified reverse-scanning power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.74% and a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 26.12% (from National Institute of Metrology in China). These devices retain 95% of their initial efficiency after 2,000 hours of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5G illumination at 65 &#176;C and ambient humidity (ISOS-L-2).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Type I&#8208;B Main&#8208;Chain Polyrotaxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyrotaxanes (PRs) are recognized for their outstanding conformational flexibility, making them ideal candidates for the design of high&#8208;performance mechanically interlocked materials. However, Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PRs, featuring multiple wheels and stoppers along the polymer backbone, remain underexplored due to the challenges in their design and synthesis. Herein, we introduce a facile &#8220;host&#8722;guest recognition followed by click polymerization&#8221; strategy for the synthesis of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR, which is subsequently employed to prepare the first&#8208;ever Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR network (PRN). Compared to the control whose wheels are nonslidable under applied force, the distinctive dynamic behaviors of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR impart extraordinary mechanical enhancements to PRN, with fracture strain, toughness, and puncture resistance all surging by more than 27&#8208;fold. Moreover, the combination of the host&#8722;guest recognition and multiple stoppers endows the PRN with great self&#8208;recovery capability due to the restriction of the motion range of mechanical bonds. This work not only presents a novel strategy for designing and synthesizing Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR networks but also highlights the pivotal role of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PRs in enhancing material performance, offering valuable insights for advancing the development of dynamic polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to An Enantioenriched Spiro Bisindole Directly from Indole and Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed here is a &#8220;one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of a spiro bisindole molecule directly from indole and acetone. This convenient synthesis contrasts drastically to the typical long sequence required for other privileged C2&#8208;symmetric spirocycles. The use of an alcohol additive in cooperation with chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis proved crucial to the good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The favorable interaction between the additive and CPA was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The obtained enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric bisindole was demonstrated as a useful backbone of chiral catalysts/ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C2 Electroproduction via Back Bonding in Asymmetric Copper&#8208;Copper Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered a highly attractive approach to reduce carbon emission and yet encounters challenges in further converting *C1 intermediates to valuable two&#8208;carbon (C2) products. Although copper&#8208;based catalysts exhibit satisfactory adsorption energy for *C1 species, the symmetrical charge distribution at adjacent copper sites leads to a strong repulsive force between adsorbed *C1. Herein, asymmetric copper&#8208;copper (CuF&#8208;CuN) motifs with distinct adsorption behaviors have been constructed on the F&#8208;Cu3N substrate using the in situ isostructural substitution method. Compared to the high hybridization of CuN 3d and N 2p orbitals, implanted F not only reduces the hybridization strength but also endows the CuF with delocalized unpaired electrons. Accordingly, CuF, beyond forming an isolated 3dz2&#8208;2pz &#963; bond between Cu and the key *C1 intermediate (*CHO), offers additional 3dxz&#8208;2pz &#960; back bonding to the *CHO. With dipole interactions in the asymmetric CuF&#8208;CuN motifs, the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent *CHO is diminished, efficiently promoting the C&#8208;C coupling in CO2RR. Therefore, the CuF&#8208;CuN motifs achieve&#160;an exceptional C2 selectivity of 81.5% with a partial current density of &#8722;325.9 mA cm&#8722;2 and a C2/C1 selectivity ratio of 10.47. This nuanced manipulation of atomic interactions illuminates a path to potentially groundbreaking alterations in material characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Functional Groups into B&#8592;N Organic Frameworks with Permanent Porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#8211;O bonds (BNOFs) have garnered increasing interest on account of their crystallinity, porosity and processability. However, strategies for introducing functions into BNOFs remain largely unexplored. In this work, a series of functionalized BNOFs, named BNOF&#8208;n (n = 2&#8211;9), have been designed and synthesized using a mixed&#8208;monomer assembly strategy. The obtained materials share structural similarities but reveal distinct functional groups, demonstrating excellent chemical stability, high surface areas, and remarkable regenerability. Notably, BNOF&#8208;5, functionalized with abundant carboxyl groups, achieves exceptional reversible NH3 adsorption capacity (up to 10.0 mmol g&#8722;1 at 1 bar and 298 K), significantly surpassing that of the non&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;1 (5.6 mmol g&#8722;1) and the less&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;7 (7.9 mmol g&#8722;1), thereby clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the functionalization strategy. Remarkably, the damaged BNOF&#8208;5 can be efficiently repaired through facile regeneration, highlighting its outstanding recyclability. This work demonstrates the first attempt of functionalization methodology in BNOFs, extending their potential toward diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Splicing Them Together: Construction of Polyoxovanadate&#8211;Organic Polyhedra&#8208;based Pyrgoscage and Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Following the construction schemes of pyrgoscages and catenanes, attempts to splice polyoxovanadate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (POV&#8208;MOPs) together have been carried out in this work. To meet the requirements of POV&#8208;MOPs with varied sizes, synthetic strategies including reconstruction of original vertex, introduction of exogenous vertex, and initiative of polyhedral interlock have been developed, which successfully integrated a pair of tetrahedral monomers into an hourglass&#8208;shaped dimer. On top of this, several structuring principles, such as anisotropic enhancement, electrostatic potential reduction, and sufficient intramolecular support, can be drawn from here and popularized to the related MOP systems. Thanks to the advent of such splicing techniques managed by both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions, the close communication of POV&#8208;MOPs has afforded not only the unprecedented structural archetypes, but the unique behaviors for NH3 adsorption as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibronic Trimer Design Enhancing Intramolecular Triplet&#8208;Exciton Hopping to Accelerate Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation for Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA&#8208;UC) is a well&#8208;known process that converts low&#8208;energy light into higher&#8208;energy light. This process has attracted attention for its potential in various fields, including light&#8208;emitting devices, power generation and medical applications. To promote these societal applications, it is desirable to develop TTA&#8208;UC materials of TTA emitters with large TTA rate constants (kTTA). However, molecular design to accelerate the bimolecular rate constant of kTTA has not been considered. We present a strategy to increase kTTA by assembling multiple chromophores linked to a boron in a rotationally symmetric manner, causing asymmetric motions by a localized triplet exciton. We have studied tri(9&#8208;anthryl)borane, which consists of three anthracenes linked via boron, as a TTA emitter. Time&#8208;resolved luminescence measurements confirmed that kTTA is improved compared to the conventional TTA&#8208;UC system using DPA, an anthracene&#8208;based monomer. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that the improvement in kTTA is due to fast intramolecular triplet exciton hopping coupled with vibrational motions in the trimer molecule, which extends the reactivity at the collision distance between the excitons through the pseudo&#8208;rotational motions. The current emitter molecular design that enhances TTA reactivity is expected to contribute to the future development of TTA&#8208;UC materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Reengineering of a Proteomimetic Pan&#8208;Ras Inhibitor into a Ras Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional ligands that can coax protein&#8208;protein interactions have become attractive therapeutic modalities. Herein, we describe conformationally defined helix dimers as proteomimetic molecular glues. The helix dimers can be rationally designed toengage helical protein interfaces. We previously described a synthetic Sos protein mimic, CHDSOS, as a Ras ligand that inhibits wild&#8208;type and oncogenic Ras signaling. This Sos proteomimetic consisted of a crosslinked helix dimer (CHD) that reproduced two helical domains, termed aH and aI, from Sos. The native aH helix of Sos constitutes the primary contact surface for Sos while aI has minimal engagement. We conjectured that the aI domain of CHDSOS could be reengineered to preserve Ras binding while engaging another protein to fully leverage the contact residues available in a proteomimetic. Herein, we incorporate a second distinct binding epitope into CHDSOS, thereby generating a bispecific proteomimetic. This secondary epitope was designed based on the p53 activation domain to engage the E3 ligase MDM2 and induce complexation with Ras. The resulting lead proteomimetic, CHDBI4, associates with both MDM2 and Ras and demonstrates reduction of cellular Ras levels. Overall, the study offers a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the development of a bispecific proteomimetic scaffold to target multiple protein interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Al3+&#8208;Dependent Anisotropic Facet Tailoring on SrTiO3 Single Crystal for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable fabrication of single&#8208;crystal metal oxide is of paramount importance for advanced photo(electro)catalytic applications, but achieving non&#8208;equilibrium crystal shapes with tailored facets through molten salt synthesis still remains a challenge. Herein, we systematically explored the effect of Al3+ concentration in tailoring crystal facets of SrTiO3 single crystals, and developed a one&#8208;step molten salt strategy for engineering anisotropic structures by using miscible AlCl3 as Al3+ additive. By progressively increasing Al3+ concentration, a series of high&#8208;quality SrTiO3 single crystals exposing {100}, {111} and {110} facets were sequentially synthesized. Theoretical calculations reveal an Al&#8208;doping stabilized {111} surface reconstruction, and provide further atomistic insights into the surface structural evolution with Wulff constructions as Al3+ concentration increases. Experimental results demonstrate that the anisotropic facets dominate the efficient charge separation for the enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting activity. Consequently, SrTiO3 single crystals enclosed by well&#8208;defined {100} and {111} facets exhibit a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 2621.85 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1 and an apparent quantum yield value of 50.5% at 350 nm for stoichiometric overall water splitting. This work offers a molten&#8208;salt synthetic strategy and valuable insight for preparing facet&#8208;controlled single&#8208;crystal semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly  Engineered Circular Additive with&#160;Multi&#8208;site Desolvation for High&#8208;performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive engineering can effectively relieve interface issues of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), but most additives induce the sluggish interface kinetics and boosted polarization, especially at high current density and low temperature. Herein, the relationship between additive molecular structure and desolvation behaviour is built by utilizing a series of circular and linear sugar molecules as prototypes, which systematically reveals molecular size, steric configuration, electronic structure are design criteria for additives to achieve fast desolvation. As indicated by theoretical simulations and experiments, circular fructose (FRU) molecule with small size, quasi&#8208;planar adsorption configuration, and enhanced electron delocalization enables the compact electric double layer (EDL) with shorter Zn2+ diffusion path and lower activation energy via multi&#8208;site desolvation, thus obtaining the rapid interface kinetics and facilitating highly reversible zinc anode over a wide temperature range. Zn//Zn cell exhibits long cycle life exceeding 9500 hours, and Zn//NVO cell maintains 83.92% high&#8208;capacity retention after 2480 cycles under 6.95 &#956;L mg&#8208;1 lean electrolyte and 11.94 mg cm&#8208;2 high loading.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Production of Acetylene from the C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction of CH4 with CO2 Mediated by Ta2O2+ Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;conversion of methane and carbon dioxide to C2 hydrocarbons via the CCH4&#8722;CCO2 coupling reaction is of great significance to mitigate greenhouse effect and develop an alternative route for manufacture of important industrial feedstocks (e.g., C2H2), however, it has not yet been achieved so far owing to the difficulty in breaking both of the C=O bonds in CO2 as well as the precise control of sequential elementary reactions targeted for C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, by using the tantalum oxide Ta2O2+ as an active cluster, an unprecedented CCH4&#8722;CCO2 coupling reaction of CH4 with CO2 to exclusively produce the C2 hydrocarbon of C2H2 has been successfully realized even at room temperature by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass spectrometry. The in situ reconstruction from Ta&#8722;O&#8722;Ta cluster skeleton to tantalum carbide Ta&#8722;C&#8722;Ta experienced upon the pre&#8208;reaction with CH4 is critical to delicately control the sequential elementary reactions targeted for C2H2 generation. This finding not only leads to a breakthrough in the field of gas&#8208;phase and condensed&#8208;phase chemistry wherein the C2+ oxygenated compounds were the mainstream products for CCH4&#8722;CCO2 coupling of CH4 with CO2, but also explores a new active structure and a novel reaction mechanism beneficial for selective production of C2 hydrocarbons from co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Solvation Chemistry of Pentavalent Vanadium for Wide&#8208;temperature Range Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable solutions for storing renewable energies. However, the poor thermal stability of pentavalent vanadium [V(V)] electrolyte, manifested as V2O5 precipitation at high temperatures, leads to more critical heat management, low energy density, and even low reliability. The unclear dynamic solvation chemistry of V(V) ions brings difficulties in solving the above issues intrinsically. Herein, we investigated solvation structures and dynamic evolution of V(V) electrolyte using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). For the first time, we clarified the transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3, identifying the second deprotonation as the rate&#8208;determining step. Based on this, we developed stabilization strategies through anion coordination and proton concentration control. The incorporation of HCl&#160;and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid improved the thermal stability of V(V) electrolytes remarkably. The optimized electrolyte showed no precipitation during 30&#8208;day static tests at 50 &#176;C, enabling stable cycling performance of 3,000 cycles in VFB single cells. Further demonstration in a kW&#8208;scale stack achieved over 1,000 cycles, validating the scalability and viability. Our work provides insights into the solvation chemistry of V(V) species, paving the way to improve the reliability and energy density of a VFB system.</dc:description>

         <title>The Flexibility of Tetra(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands Controls the Nuclearity and Geometry of Polynuclear MI&#8210;NHC Assemblies</title>

Tetracarbene ligands composed of two di(phenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)amine groups linked by an anthracene bridge exhibit restricted rotation of the Cphenyl&#9472;N&#9472;Cphenyl plane relative to the anthracene moiety if the N(Ph&#9472;NHC)2 moieties are directly attached to anthracene. The presence or absence of this restriction has been used in coordination driven self&#8208;assembly to prepare discrete M4L2, M6L3 and M8L4 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag+, Au+) assemblies. 








Abstract
A series of tetrakisimidazolium salts bearing two di(phenylimidazolium)amine groups linked by differently substituted anthracenes has been prepared. These are H4&#8208;1a(PF6)4 (anthracene bridge), H4&#8208;1b(PF6)4 (phenyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge), H4&#8208;1c(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge), and H4&#8208;1d(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl&#8208;anthracene bridge). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that those ligand precursors having the di(phenylimidazolium)amine connected directly to the anthracene experience restricted rotation about the N&#9472;Canthracene bond. Depending on their flexibility, the reaction of the tetrakisimidazolium salts with Ag2O followed by transmetalation with [AuCl(THT)] yielded octanuclear ([Au8(1a)4](PF6)8), tetranuclear ([Au4(1b)2](PF6)4), hexanuclear ([Au6(1c)3](PF6)6), or octanuclear ([Au8(1d)4](PF6)8) assemblies, demonstrating the direct bonding strategy can be employed for the selective synthesis of polynuclear poly&#8208;NHC (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) metallosupramolecular assemblies.

         <title>An Organic&#8208;Inorganic&#8208;Integrated Solid Electrolyte Interphase with High&#160;Resilience and Anti&#8208;Corrosion for Sustainable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc metal batteries are highly regarded for their exceptional safety, low cost, environmental compatibility, and potential as a sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, Zn dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution on anode side result in limited lifespan and safety issues. Herein, an organic&#8208;inorganic&#8208;integrated solid electrolyte interphase was in&#8208;situ formed by adding 4&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole as an electrolyte additive. The artificial SEI merited higher maximum elastic deformation energy due to relatively high resilience and toughness, which can prevent Zn dendrite penetration and anode self&#8208;cracking and pulverization. In addition, N&#8208;containing heterocyclic in SEI acts as a H+ catcher, thereby inhibiting anode corrosion and hydrogen evolution. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell has delivered stable cycling performance after 1500 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 with a terminated capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. And an outstanding coulombic efficiency of 99.46% at 2200th cycle was achieved for a Cu||Zn asymmetric cell. Furthermore, a Zn||PANI full battery presented a stable cycling performance with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 97.6% after 200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Family of Chiral Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a Fused Sidechain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of chiral non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a fused sidechain was synthesized and used as efficient ligands in three copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reactions at the catalyst loading of 1&#160;mol%, including SN2&#8242; silylation, conjugate silylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and silylation of azadienes.








Abstract
Although a considerable number of chiral nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been developed yet it is highly necessary to develop new NHCs bearing multiple sites for facile modifications of both electronic nature and steric hindrance. Herein, we uncover a new family of chiral non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a fused sidechain, whose precursors are synthesized by a simple five&#8208;step route. The synthesis includes Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling or nucleophilic addition/oxidation, chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinolines, bromination at C8, Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, and cyclization with methyl orthoformate. Among nine prepared NHCs, YC&#8208;NHC8 is the optimal ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric SN2&#8242; silylation, YC&#8208;NHC3 works as the best ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate silylation of simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and YC&#8208;NHC9 serves as the most suitable ligand for copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric silylation of azadienes. Remarkably, these three reactions are successfully run under a catalyst loading of 0.1&#160;mol%, indicating that YC&#8208;NHCs may have the potential to be broadly used in efficient asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Thioamides Adjacent to the Ionizable Amine Headgroup in Ionizable Lipids Reduce the pKa of Lipid Nanoparticles and Enhance mRNA Transfection Efficiency in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing an ionizable lipid with a thioamide adjacent to the tertiary amine have a lower pKa than those containing an analogous lipid with a conventional amide, and exhibit significantly improved mRNA transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery vectors. However, optimizing LNPs for in vivo applications remains largely empirical. The apparent pKa of LNPs is a predictive factor for in vivo performance, with pKa values between 6 and 7 showing the highest efficacy. Despite this critical role of ionizable lipids in LNPs, the relationship between lipid structure and its influence on LNP pKa remains poorly studied. In this study, we report the design and the synthesis of a novel class of ionizable lipids featuring a thioamide moiety, enabling direct comparison between thioamide&#8208;containing (SAM) LNPs and amide&#8208;containing (OAM) LNPs. We find that substituting oxygen with sulfur in the amide group significantly decreases the apparent pKa of LNPs, increasing the likelihood of identifying lipids in combinatorial libraries that yield LNPs with a pKa in the desired 6&#8211;7 range. The reduction in pKa in LNPs containing SAM lipids, compared with OAM lipids, is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the thioamide group. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple libraries of SAM lipids and varying the ionizable head group, alkyl chains, and linker length, we discovered thioamide lipids with distinct tissue tropism, including lipids that mediate splenic targeting by LNPs.

         <title>Enantioselective Decarboxylative Acylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids with Carboxylic Acids via Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives with carboxylic acids has been developed, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as a pivotal platform for constructing C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, using two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids as a feedstock to form chiral &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones remains a considerable challenge due to side reactions such as decarboxylative reduction and homocoupling. Herein, we report for the first time a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives and aliphatic carboxylic acids, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% e.e.). The advantage of this reaction is that it eliminates the need for metal reductants and the use of precious metal photocatalysts and utilizes renewable feedstocks. The use of a coiled&#8208;tube continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor can shorten the illumination time by half and obtain results comparable to those of a batch reaction. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments support a pathway in which photocatalytic decarboxylation generates &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl radical species, and the Ni(I)&#8211;alkyl intermediate activates the in situ&#8211;formed mixed anhydride followed by reductive elimination to give the product in enantiomerically pure form.

         <title>Phenylene Cage Synthesized by Metal&#8208;mediated Assembly of Phenylene Macrocycle and its Piezofluorochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phenylene macrocycle containing two meta&#8208;phenylene units positioned opposite each other was used as a building block to construct phenylene cages via platinum&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C coupling. A phenylene cage (PC[10]3), consisting of three phenylene macrocycle units, was successfully synthesized and thoroughly characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. PC[10]3 exhibited significant backbone strain and displayed bright blue emission with a quantum yield of 96%. Additionally, PC[10]3 exhibited a broader and more pronounced piezofluorochromic response compared to its macrocyclic unit, undergoing a distinct photoluminescence shift from blue to yellow&#8208;green under pressure. This work opens new avenues for designing and synthesizing hydrocarbon nanocages.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydrogenation of Phenols to Cyclohexanones over Hydrotalcite&#8208;Supported Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclohexanones are widely used chemicals and currently produced by the oxidation of the fossil feedstocks. Direct selective hydrogenation of lignin derivatives has great potential for producing these chemicals, but is challenging to obtain high yields. Here, we report that hydrotalcite&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;atom (Pd/CHT&#8208;800) catalyst enabled the hydrogenation of the benzene ring in the aromatics without the overreaction of carbonyl group, which could afford &gt;99.9% yield of cyclohexanones using water as the reaction medium. The reaction mechanism was systematically studied by the control experiments and detailed in situ characterizations. In the Pd/CHT&#8208;800 catalyst, the Pd&#8208;O&#8208;MgAl sites were formed, and the cooperation of the Pd atoms and calcined CHT material could not only realize the aromatic hydrogenation efficiently, but also inhibit the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group in the reaction effectively. This work provides a novel route for the sustainable production of cyclohexanones.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Enrichment&#160;and Quantitative Analysis of In Vivo Protein Complexes via Dimethylpiperidine Cross&#8208;Linker DPST</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vivo cross&#8208;linking&#160;mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) enables the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein complexes in living cells. However, most XL&#8208;MS methods face significant sample loss during enrichment, limiting their applications to limited&#8208;quantity samples, and suffer from poor reproducibility (20%&#8208;40%), hindering precise quantification. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel membrane&#8208;permeable cross&#8208;linker, 2,6&#8208;dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), in which the dimethylpiperidinyl group enables one&#8208;step enrichment of cross&#8208;linked peptides via Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) antibody approach, eliminating sample loss from multi&#8208;step processes and allowing analysis from as few as 1E4 cells. DPST also allows the light and heavy isotopic labeling of cross&#8208;linked samples at the cellular level, which reduces inaccuracies from multi&#8208;step preparations. This generates reporter ions for precise MS2 quantification, improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio without increasing spectral complexity. Using DPST, we analyzed cross&#8208;links in primary neurons from single fetal mice and quantified the transient and weak interactions in dynamic liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) environments. Additionally, DPST&#8217;s design supports multiple isotopic labeling configurations (e.g., 6&#8208;plex, 10&#8208;plex). Therefore, DPST provides a scalable and robust tool for in vivo XL&#8208;MS&#8208;based qualitative and quantitative analysis of living cells, even with limited sample quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing the Quinoidal Form of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by O&#8212;B&#8592;N Units to Give a &gt; 1000 nm Redshift in the Absorption Wavelength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have distinct chemical structures and excellent optoelectronic properties. Although PAHs with ultra&#8208;large &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons have been successfully synthesized, ultrasmall bandgap (Eg &lt; 1.2 eV) or short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light absorption (&#955; &gt; 1000 nm) is seldom reported for PAHs. In this work, we design and synthesize a PAH by incorporating four O&#8212;B&#8592;N units into naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the core. The incorporation of four O&#8212;B&#8592;N units changes the NDI core from an aromatic form to a quinoidal form, leading to significantly enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. As a result, the optical bandgap of the molecule decreases from 3.10 eV to 0.88 eV and the onset absorption wavelength is redshifted from 400 nm to 1410 nm. The resulting molecule exhibits strong light absorption in the infrared region and high transparency in the visible region. It can be used to develop colorless infrared anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to tune optoelectronic properties of PAHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyl Amination of Olefins via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to traditional ground&#8208;state palladium catalyzed alkyl Heck reactions, which are thermodynamically unfavourable and endothermic, excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis facilitates single&#8208;electron mechanisms, with light primarily driving the formation of alkyl radicals from triplet&#8208;state Pd(0). Here, we report a novel and mechanistically distinct Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction, where the key hybrid alkyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical intermediate is generated from the triplet&#8208;state Pd(II) at room temperature. This hybrid species engages in the addition to dienes and conjugated enynes, producing a transposed open&#8208;shell allyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical, which undergoes radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) to yield the desired alkyl amination products. Density functional theory (DFT) studies offer insights into the reaction mechanism, confirming the involvement of hybrid alkyl/allyl Pd(I) radical species as key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;activated heterogeneous Fenton process for accelerated degradation of aromatic pollutants over copper oxide catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been commonly adopted for Fenton&#8208;like oxidation of organic pollutants, but generally suffer from inadequate activity in practical water treatment applications due to surface passivation by accumulated pollutants and sluggish redox cycling of active metal. Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant&#8208;induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H2O2 activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer route, generating surface&#8208;bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H2O2 activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low&#8208;valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe&#8208;Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst&#8208;phenol interaction towards self&#8208;activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14&#8208;time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude higher H2O2 utilization efficiency than the Fe2O3 control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100&#8208;day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst&#8208;pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal-based heterogeneous catalysts have been commonly adopted for Fenton-like oxidation of organic pollutants, but generally suffer from inadequate activity in practical water treatment applications due to surface passivation by accumulated pollutants and sluggish redox cycling of active metal. Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant-induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H2O2 activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand-to-metal charge transfer route, generating surface-bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H2O2 activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low-valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe-Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst-phenol interaction towards self-activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14-time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order-of-magnitude higher H2O2 utilization efficiency than the Fe2O3 control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100-day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst-pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasmonic DNA&#8208;Barcoded Virion Nano&#8208;Oscillators for Multiplexed Quantification of Small&#8208;Molecule Binding Kinetics to Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;density nano&#8208;oscillator platform using self&#8208;assembled DNA&#8208;barcoded virion sensors is developed to address the critical need for high&#8208;throughput label&#8208;free measurement of small&#8208;molecule binding to membrane proteins. By integrating virion display technology with charge&#8208;sensitive plasmonic detection, our platform enables robust, label&#8208;free quantification of small&#8208;molecule binding kinetics to membrane proteins. Gold nanoparticle&#8208;virion conjugates are self&#8208;assembled onto a plasmonic sensor chip via a flexible molecular linker to form high&#8208;density nano&#8208;oscillators. Driven by an alternating electric field, the oscillation amplitudes of the nano&#8208;oscillators are precisely measured via widefield plasmonic imaging. This charge&#8208;sensitive mechanism can sensitively detect the binding of small&#8208;molecule ligands to the membrane proteins displayed on the virions at single&#8208;nanosensor resolution, overcoming the sensitivity limit of conventional mass&#8208;sensitive techniques. More importantly, the platform employs novel affinity&#8208;discriminated DNA barcodes for multi&#8208;state decoding with exponential multiplexing capacity, enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of a library of membrane proteins. For a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, binding kinetics of five pairs of G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and their corresponding small molecule ligands are measured on a single sensor chip, with all individual nano&#8208;oscillators identified by just two affinity&#8208;discriminated, quadra&#8208;state DNA decoders. This technology advances membrane protein research and drug screening capabilities, offering a practical solution for biomolecular interaction studies and biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;Level Oxygen Enables 100% Selectivity in Urea Synthesis via Photocatalytic C&#8208;N Coupling of CO and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clean&#8208;energy&#8208;driven synthesis of urea from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules has garnered significant interest but remained great challenges to achieve with high selectivity. Herein we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 under an air&#8208;level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31 mg gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen&#8208;free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to &#8226;NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen&#8208;derived O2&#8226;&#8211;. This &#8226;NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air&#8208;level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 while preventing over&#8208;oxidation. This work presents a new approach for highly selective urea synthesis and highlights the essential role of O2 in modulating reaction activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoridation&#8208;assisted Interfacial Dipole for CsPbI3&#160;Perovskite Solar Cells with over 22% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite attracts remarkable interest in photovoltaic applications due to its outstanding thermal stability and optoelectronic properties. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly suffer from severe energy losses due to interface nonradiative recombination and poor charge carrier transport, predominantly affecting their photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Herein, an interfacial dipole engineering is introduced for CsPbI3 PSCs, in which azetidinium chloride (Az) and its fluorinated derivative 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidinium chloride (DFAz) are employed to manipulate the interface properties of PSCs and thus diminish energy losses. Systematically theoretical calculations and experimental studies reveal that the fluoridation&#8208;assisted ammonium molecule could form a stronger interaction with perovskites and thereby arrange the dipole alignment on the superficial layer of perovskites, which could simultaneously ameliorate passivation effect and energy level alignment of the perovskite and hole transport layers, thereby suppressing interface recombination. Meanwhile, the coordinated bonding between the ammonium and hole transport layer facilitates charge transport at the heterojunction interface by offering additional carrier transport channels. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs deliver a high efficiency of up to 22.05%. This work provides important design principles of interface engineering for high&#8208;performance solar cells to minimize energy losses.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Boron Insertion into Thiaarenes via Boryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles represents a straightforward approach to rapidly expand the accessible chemical space. While notable progress has been made on the direct modification of various nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;heterocycles, editing of prevalent sulfur&#8208;containing heteroarenes, especially for single&#8208;atom insertion, remains exceedingly rare. This disparity is primarily attributed to the sulfur atom's inherent nucleophilicity and high susceptibility to oxidation. Here we present a conceptually distinct photocatalytic strategy that enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes, furnishing previously inaccessible cyclic thioborane scaffolds and synthetically valuable alkyl boronates in an efficient manner. Furthermore, mechanistic studies have revealed that the boron insertion step proceeds through an unprecedented mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Au6Cu2&#160;Clusters with High Electron Affinity and Oxygen&#8208;Mimetic Properties for Hypoxic Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypoxia&#8208;induced radioresistance primarily contributes to the failure of radiotherapy because it hinders the effective fixation of DNA damage. Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron&#8208;affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose&#8208;dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene&#8208;functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen&#8208;mimetic property of chemical molecules to fix DNA damage. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster&#8208;based hypoxic radiosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Driving Mechanism Revealed in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Atom FeN2O2 Carbon Dots for Superior Peroxidase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doped&#160;single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAEs) hold great promise as enzyme mimics, yet their catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that the proton driving mechanism induced by sulfur doping in single&#8208;atom FeN2O2 carbon dots (S&#8208;FeCDs) significantly enhances peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. Synthesized via low&#8208;temperature carbonization, S&#8208;FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC&#8208;STEM. The POD&#8208;specific activity of S&#8208;FeCDs reached 295 U/mg, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than that of sulfur&#8208;free FeCDs, with natural enzyme&#8208;like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the &#916;G for H2O2&#8208;to&#8208;&#183;OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (2*OH &#8594; *O+*H2O) from 2.50 eV to 1.62 eV. In vivo, S&#8208;FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA&#8208;infected wound models, achieving near&#8208;complete healing within 7 days.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heteroatom-doped&#160;single-atom nanozymes (SAEs) hold great promise as enzyme mimics, yet their catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that the proton driving mechanism induced by sulfur doping in single-atom FeN2O2 carbon dots (S-FeCDs) significantly enhances peroxidase (POD)-like activity. Synthesized via low-temperature carbonization, S-FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC-STEM. The POD-specific activity of S-FeCDs reached 295 U/mg, which is 11.2-fold higher than that of sulfur-free FeCDs, with natural enzyme-like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the &#916;G for H2O2-to-&#183;OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate-determining step (2*OH &#8594; *O+*H2O) from 2.50 eV to 1.62 eV. In vivo, S-FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA-infected wound models, achieving near-complete healing within 7 days. The proton driving mechanism was further validated through nitro compound reduction, demonstrating accelerated N-H bond activation. This work highlights the critical role of sulfur-induced proton dynamics in enhancing SAEs performance, providing a rational strategy for designing multifunctional nanozymes in biomedical and catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Polarity of Imine Bonds in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has also drawn attention to the influence of the nature of imine binding, including its orientation and possible protonation, on the chemical and physical properties of imine COFs. However, the influence of the polarity of imine bond (C=N) on the photocatalytic performance of COFs has not yet been described. In this work, we synthesized a series of imine COFs with differently polarized C=N bonds by altering the C=N bond orientation and regulating the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) strength, respectively. The less polarized C=N bond for one of the COFs possesses a faster charge separation with a decrease of exciton binding energy (Eb). In contrast, the imine COF with more polarized C=N bond exhibits a stronger internal electric field contributing to a more efficient charge transfer. Taking into account this trade&#8208;off between binding energy and charge transfer concerning the effect of C=N polarity on the photocatalytic performances, the imine COF with moderately polarized C=N bond shows the highest hydrogen evolution performance of 28.1 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1. This work provides evidence that the polarity of C=N should be taken into account when designing and tuning the properties of imine COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>HFIP&#8208;promoted E&#8208;selective Asymmetric   Crotylboration  of Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Silyl Crotylboronate with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyketide synthesis consistently requires the development of linchpin&#8208;type allylboron reagents, such as &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates. Traditionally, these reagents feature &#945;&#8208;tertiary substitution and are used in aprotic solvents, typically yielding homoallylic alcohols with disubstituted (Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes.  Here we report the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched quaternary &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates via stereospecific allylic Matteson homologation.    We further demonstrate that hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)&#8212;a polar alcoholic solvent that has been underutilized in allylboration&#8212;not only enhances reaction reactivity but also overrides the typical (Z)&#8208;selectivity, enabling access to the otherwise challenging (E)&#8208;selective products. The method enables the rapid construction of (E)&#8208;anti&#8208;2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;oxy motif, a structural unit frequently found in polyketides, and  allows the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of PM050463. DFT calculations suggest that HFIP's strong hydrogen bonding effect increases the Lewis acidity of the boron center and the steric effect of Bpin, resulting in high yields and (E)&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Functionalization of Cyclic Ketones via Electrochemical Interrupted Dowd&#8208;Beckwith Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deconstructive functionalization of cyclic molecules has recently emerged as a prominent strategy to access unique architectures that are challenging to prepare through traditional methods. While significant progress has been made in the deconstructive functionalization of cyclic alcohols and amines, the strategies for deconstructing cyclic ketones remain largely unexplored. The Dowd&#8208;Beckwith reaction, a ring&#8208;expansion of cyclic ketones, is a powerful method for synthesizing medium&#8208; and large&#8208;ring compounds. Herein, we developed the first interrupted Dowd&#8208;Beckwith (IDB) reaction for highly regioselective deconstructive functionalization of cyclic ketones using electricity as the sole oxidant. This protocol is widely applicable for the deconstruction of small, medium&#8208;sized, and macrocyclic ketones bearing a diverse range of functional groups. Remarkably, various naturally occurring complex cyclic ketones were successfully deconstructed into acyclic molecules, which are difficult to access by known strategies. The method was applied to the asymmetric synthesis of planococcol, citrilol acetate, maconelliol, and its derivatives. Furthermore, the functional groups incorporated during the transformation provided versatile handles for subsequent synthetic modifications. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover followed by deconstructive functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonconjugated Structural Distortion Promoting&#160; the Formation of NIR Triplet states in Phenothiazine Dyes for Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet&#8208;state dyes are pivotal for advanced biomedical and material science applications. Although numerous strategies have been proposed to enhance the photosensitization efficiency of dyes, significant challenges remain. Herein, we propose a novel strategy leveraging nonconjugated structural distortion to enhance triplet&#8208;state formation. This strategy, achieved by introducing steric groups at the edges of the phenothiazine (PTZ) dye framework, notably enhances intersystem crossing (ISC) and prolongs triplet&#8208;state lifetime. Based on this strategy, HNBS and HNBSe are synthesized, which exhibit exceptional triplet&#8208;state quantum yields (47.2% for HNBS and 87.7% for HNBSe) and prolonged triplet&#8208;excited&#8208;state lifetimes (21.1 &#956;s for HNBS and 6.3 &#956;s for HNBSe). These values substantially exceed those of conventional dyes, such as NBS (negligible and NBSe (3.2 &#956;s). Under ultralow&#8208;light doses (0.45 J/cm2 in vitro, 6 J/cm2 in vivo), these photosensitizers demonstrate robust tumor cell inhibition, highlighting their exceptional photosensitizing ability. Mechanistically, HNBS possesses lysosomal&#8208;targeting ability, and upon light irradiation, it induces lysosomal damage, triggering pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death. These processes promote dendritic cell maturation and T&#8208;cell differentiation, augmenting the immune response and enabling effective photoimmunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Single&#8208;Ion and Weakly&#8208;Solvating Nanometric Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent need for high energy density (&gt; 400 Wh kg&#8208;1) has driven advancements in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, degradation of traditional electrolytes restricts high cut&#8208;off voltage &lt; 4.4 V, while low lithium transference numbers (tLi+) lead to polarization and early charge/discharge termination, which typically necessitate use of multiple solvents or salt&#8208;concentrated electrolytes to enable high&#8208;voltage chemistry. To address this challenge, we developed a single&#8208;solvent, single&#8208;salt electrolyte with tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), achieving a high tLi+ of 0.82 and enabling ultra&#8208;high&#8208;voltage LMB operation up to 5.0 V. Large molecular sterics and electron density delocalization of TFEP enabled dominant presence of local aggregates (AGGs), which further populated to form large and ion&#8208;rich weakly&#8208;solvating nanometric aggregates (n&#8208;AGGs), changing redox properties and promoting the interfacial stabilities to a greater extent. As a result, we showed suppressed dendrite formation with stable cycling for over 1,500 hours, and full&#8208;cell operations paired with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) at 4.7 V and with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) at 5.0 V. The tuning of bulk electrolyte properties from the scale of microscopic electronic structures to mesoscopic solvation structures has effectively enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the electrolyte, paving the way for lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage tolerance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Exploring an efficient catalytic system for tandem upcycling of CO2 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly desirable for achieving efficient resource utilization of wastes. However, the high activation energy for C=O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p&#8208;xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to form Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Zr sites. The Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro&#8208;deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36 h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Zr sites also drives the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Linked Ionic Covalent Organic Framework with Fast Reaction Kinetics for High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Capacity Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their well&#8208;defined topologies and tunable pore architectures. However, their practical application is often limited by intrinsically sluggish charge transfer and inferior reaction kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an ionic quinoline&#8208;linked COF (iQCOF) cathode via a one&#8208;pot Povarov reaction with triazole ionic liquid. The iQCOF architecture achieves a synergistic enhancement by integrating &#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;induced charge delocalization to facilitate charge transport, the specific adsorption effect to gain fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and polar triazine units to enable uniform ion flux for stable interfaces. As a result, iQCOF delivers a high specific capacity of 407 mAh g&#8722;1 with 701 Wh kg&#8722;1, and exceptional rate capability (121 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1) with 0.0027% per cycle over 10000 cycles, further highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;performance organic cathode. This work provides a convenient strategy for advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with fast reaction kinetics for high&#8208;rate performance, paving the way for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Gated Covalent Adaptivity in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Stable Actuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), with reversible actuation of large and anisotropic deformation, have surged in smart materials such as soft robotics, sensors and artificial muscles. LCEs incorporating dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) endowing network with rearranging ability through reversible bond reaction, facilitating the fabrication of soft actuators with tailored actuation modes and reprogrammability. However, unintended activation of DCBs during actuation, particularly under thermal perturbations, remains a critical challenge, as it damages actuation stability which arises catastrophic failure and potential security risks in practical applications. Present strategies in enhancing actuation stability either achieve only temporary stability or sacrificed reprogrammability or actuation performance. Here, we propose a strategy incorporating catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;AC/A DCB of high temperature active&#8208;threshold to fabricate stable dynamic LCE actuators with thermally gated behavior. This design exhibits a &#8220;thermal gate&#8221; at 120 &#176;C with inert bond exchange below this threshold, yet rapidly activated at 160 &#176;C. The integrated permanent crosslinks further prevent unintended chain slippage, ensuring topological stability. The resulting dynamic LCE could be fabricated to actuators efficiently and exhibiting unprecedented durability at 120 &#176;C (sustaining 10,000 actuation cycles). The switches between reprogrammability and actuation stability are long&#8208;standing reversible, meeting the demands of long&#8208;term service without compromising its reprogrammability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cerium&#8208;Naphthazarin Catecholate MOF as a Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Selective Functionalization of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we have successfully synthesized a series of novel semiconducting 2D catecholate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on naphthazarin ligands by utilizing unraveled metal&#8208;acetyl acetonate linkage chemistry. The synthesized Ce&#8208;Naph MOF exhibited excellent light absorption properties and chemical stability across various solvents. Its insoluble and stable framework, combined with an optimal band gap, enabled its use as a photocatalyst for organic transformations. For the first time, Ce&#8208;Naph MOF is explored as a heterogeneous catalyst for photocatalytic applications specifically for the selective C&#8211;H amination of alkanes, achieving yields of up to 89% under ambient conditions. We propose that the initial metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer in Ce&#8208;Naph MOF, promoted by light, is essential for forming an active alkoxy&#8208;Ce(IV)&#8208;species. This species subsequently undergoes ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer to generate the alkoxy radical, which acts as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent to activate alkanes.&#160; Furthermore, Ce&#8208;Naph MOF demonstrated long&#8208;term cyclic stability, maintaining its catalytic activity and structural integrity over five cycles, highlighting its durability as a heterogeneous catalyst. We are confident that this straightforward and practical methodology opens new avenues for industrial applications, significantly advancing the fields of metal catalysis, photocatalysis, and sustainable chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Symmetry of Active Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Valorization of Polyester Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical upcycling of waste plastics offers a promising way toward achieving a circular economy and alleviating environmental pollution but remains a huge challenge. Inspired by hydrolase enzymes and aiming to overcome their intrinsic limitations, we put forward a design principle for an innovative nanozyme featuring asymmetric metal sites. This nanozyme functions as photocatalyst enabling sustainable valorization of polyester plastics. As a proof of concept, an asymmetric ligand substitution strategy is developed to construct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that defective MIL&#8208;101(Fe) (D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101) with asymmetric Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ (0&lt; &#948; &lt;1) sites. The differential electronic configurations inherent to adjacent Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ sites endow a high photocatalytic activity for the valorization of polyester plastic. Accordingly, the ester bonds of polyesters can be preferentially cleaved, contributing to the low energy barrier of upcycling plastics. As a result, the D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 achieves a high monomer yield with terephthalic acid of ~93.9% and ethylene glycol of ~87.1% for photocatalytic valorization of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), beyond the efficiency of natural enzyme and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. In addition, such a D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 is demonstrated to be feasible for the valorization of various real&#8208;world polyester plastic wastes in a flow photocatalysis system.</dc:description>

As a result, the D-MIL-101 achieves a high monomer yield with terephthalic acid of ~93.9% and ethylene glycol of ~87.1% for photocatalytic valorization of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), beyond the efficiency of natural enzyme and state-of-the-art photocatalysts. In addition, such a D-MIL-101 is demonstrated to be feasible for the valorization of various real-world polyester plastic wastes in a flow photocatalysis system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Asymmetry Amplification through Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymorphism has recently emerged as a powerful concept, enabling a single chemical entity to form distinct, stable assemblies in solution with diverse morphological, photophysical, and electronic properties. Despite this progress, the interplay between supramolecular polymorphism and chirality remains unexplored. Herein, we harness supramolecular polymorphism to control the amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymerization (SP). For this purpose, we designed two Pt(II) complexes bearing &#960;&#8208;extended ligands and S&#8208; or R&#8208;chiral side chains (compounds (S)&#8208;1 and (R)&#8208;1) that self&#8208;assemble into two distinct supramolecular polymorphs in methylcyclohexane: non&#8208;emissive short fibers with parallel molecular packing (AggI) and thermodynamically more stable helical fibers with a rotationally offset stacking, closer Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt contacts and weak 3MMLCT luminescence (AggII). These polymorphs exhibit markedly different amplification of asymmetry in majority rules (MR) and sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers (SaS) studies, with the thermodynamic polymorph displaying superior performance. Ultimately, co&#8208;assembly studies between the achiral model compound 2 &#8213;which exhibits strong 3MMLCT emission in the assembled state&#8213; and the chiral but weakly emissive AggII reveal a synergistic communication between chirality and luminescence, culminating in the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study broadens the scope of supramolecular polymorphism and expands the design toolbox for adaptive supramolecular materials with emergent and synergistic functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy Reveals Spatially Resolved Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in CdS/BiOBr S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions hold great promise for photocatalysis, yet a comprehensive understanding of their charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms remains limited. While time&#8208;resolved techniques have provided valuable insights, the spatial resolution of charge transfer at the material surface remains underexplored. Here, we employ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, revealing spatially resolved details. Our findings show that upon illumination, the Fermi level (Ef) of n&#8208;type semiconductors increases, but a built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) persists within the heterojunction. Electrons accumulate on the surface of the reduction semiconductor (RS), resulting in a surface photovoltage (SPV) lower than that of the individual semiconductor, while holes accumulate on the oxidation semiconductor (OS) surface, producing an SPV higher than that of the bare material. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction leads to a remarkable increase in charge separation, with 11 additional photogenerated electrons and 3,722 additional holes compared to the bare CdS and BiOBr. These results offer critical insights into the spatially resolved charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Antimicrobial based on Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte and Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, we prepared a resveratrol&#8208;derived antimicrobial conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) named DY6 to enhance drug&#8208;like properties. While DY6&#8217;s increased hydrophobicity augmented its antibacterial efficacy, it also induced significant cytotoxicity, highlighting the long&#8208;existing dilemma of amphiphilic antimicrobials. To mitigate this issue, we employed a supramolecular strategy by complexing DY6 with sulfobutyl ether &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (S&#946;CD), forming the host&#8208;guest inclusion complex DY6@S&#946;CD. This complex elevated the half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against L929 cells from 9.4 to over 128 &#956;g/mL while maintaining a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 &#956;g/mL against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic analyses confirmed that DY6&#8217;s aromatic backbone is encapsulated within the hydrophobic cavity of S&#946;CD. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that size compatibility and electrostatic interactions are essential for stable complex formation and enhanced biocompatibility. Importantly, DY6@S&#946;CD exhibited no resistance development over 14&#8208;day serial passages against S. aureus, significantly outperforming norfloxacin. In biofilm&#8208;based MRSA&#8208;infected wound and corneal models, DY6@S&#946;CD more effectively reduced bacterial load and inflammation compared to the last&#8208;resort antibiotic vancomycin. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of supramolecular host&#8208;guest approach based on COEs to overcome the drug&#8208;resistant challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Elaboration of Confined Surfaces Steers C&#8211;C Coupling Pathway for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Ampere&#8208;level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microenvironmental engineering of electrocatalysts is pivotal for directing reaction pathways and stabilizing key intermediates in CO2RR to multi&#8208;carbon products, but it has yet to meet the industrial requirement for selectively producing a most desired product, such as ethylene or ethanol, at a steady above ampere current level. Herein, a topotactic conversion cum covalent functionalization strategy is invoked to craft a catalyst with confined and modulated surfaces that can bias the reaction heavily for ethylene production with a 22&#8208;fold boost in the ethylene/ethanol ratio. The well&#8208;tuned covalent structural motif of &#8208;Si&#8208;O&#8208;Cu&#8208; on PDMS&#8208;Cu2O/C dramatically elevates the C2H4&#8208;forming activity with a Faradaic efficiency reaching up to 71% and a high partial current density of 513.6 mA cm&#8211;2. Operando infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations unveil the ultralow coordination number and the upshifted d&#8208;band center. Notably, modulating the d&#8208;band center with the covalently elaborated surfaces allows control of the adsorption energies of CHO* and other intermediates along the ethylene path, largely lowering energy barriers for the key steps, particularly the formation of CH2CHO*. This work sheds light on the microenvironment modulation at the surface bonding to mesoscopic scales to precisely control catalytic processes and steer reaction pathways towards the target product.</dc:description>

         <title>Annulated Radical Cations with a C4E2&#8208;Core (E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb): Stable Pnictogen Analogs of Elusive Aryl Radical Anions of Birch Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron (1e&#8208;) oxidations of the base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;pnictinidene compounds 1&#8208;E afford the 7&#960;&#8208;electron C4E2&#8208;ring&#8208;containing radical cations [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+, which are valence isoelectronic to the benzene radical anion [C6H6]&#9679;&#8722; of the Birch reduction reactions. Further, 1e&#8208;oxidations of [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+ give the dications [3&#8208;E]2+, while reactions with TEMPO (or Ph2Se2) yield the corresponding diamagnetic monocations.








Abstract
The benzene radical anion (C6H6)&#9679;&#8722;, possessing a 7&#960;&#8208;electron count, is a crucial intermediate in the Birch reduction and has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Herein, we report the tricyclic pnictogen radical cations [(ADC)E]2[B], [2&#8208;E][B] (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb; [B] = [B1] = B(C6F5)4 or [B2] = {3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}) featuring a central 7&#960;&#8208;electron planar C4E2 ring embedded between two 1,3&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks, as crystalline solids. [2&#8208;E][B] are prepared by one&#8208;electron (1e) oxidations of the corresponding base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;pnictinidene compounds [(ADC)E]2 (1&#8208;E). Calculated spin densities (for E&#160;=&#160;P 76%, As 80%, Sb 88%) and EPR measurements suggest that [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+ are pnictogen&#8208;centered radicals and stabilized by the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the C4E2 ring. The EPR spectra of [2&#8208;E][B] exhibit characteristic signals for S = &#189; systems with clear hyperfine coupling constants for the two similar P, As, or Sb nuclei. Further 1e&#8208;oxidations of [2&#8208;E][B] result in the dicationic 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4E2&#8208;species [(ADC)E]2[B]2 [3&#8208;E][B]2, which readily undergo comproportionations with 1&#8208;E to afford [2&#8208;E][B]. The radical reactivity of [2&#8208;E][B2] is shown with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) and diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) in yielding compounds [(ADC)2E{E(TEMPO)}][B2] (4&#8208;E) (E&#160;=&#160;P, Sb) and [(ADC)2P{P(SePh)}][B2] (5&#8208;P), respectively.

Herein, we report the tricyclic pnictogen radical cations [(ADC)E]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B], [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-E][B] (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Dipp)C}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb; [B] = [B1] = B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or [B2] = {3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}) featuring a central 7&#960;-electron planar C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring embedded between two 1,3-imidazole-based anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks, as crystalline solids. [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-E][B] are prepared by one-electron (1e) oxidations of the corresponding base-stabilized cyclic bis-pnictinidene compounds [(ADC)E]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-E). Calculated spin densities (for E&#160;=&#160;P 76%, As 80%, Sb 88%) and EPR measurements suggest that [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-E]&lt;sup&gt;&#9679;+&lt;/sup&gt; are pnictogen-centered radicals and stabilized by the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring. The EPR spectra of [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-E][B] exhibit characteristic signals for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; = &#189; systems with clear hyperfine coupling constants for the two similar P, As, or Sb nuclei. Further 1e-oxidations of [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-E][B] result in the dicationic 6&#960;-electron C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-species [(ADC)E]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;-E][B]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which readily undergo comproportionations with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-E to afford [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-E][B]. The radical reactivity of [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-E][B2] is shown with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) and diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) in yielding compounds [(ADC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E{E(TEMPO)}][B2] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;-E) (E&#160;=&#160;P, Sb) and [(ADC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P{P(SePh)}][B2] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;-P), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixing and Matching of Hybrid Megasynthases is a Hub for the Evolution of Metabolic Diversity in Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural combinatorics: Evolutionary mixing and matching of three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters resulted in the emergence of minutumamides, a novel family of peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids. Retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis led to the discovery of nostopeptolide KVJ3, an evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis and sheds light on cluster mixing as a widespread strategy in the evolution of metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Modular megasynthases, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), are molecular assembly lines that biosynthesize many pharmaceutically and ecologically important natural products. Understanding how these compounds evolve could inspire the artificial evolution of compound diversity by metabolic engineering. Over the past two decades, a number of seminal studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of natural product evolution. However, the evolution of NRPS and PKS assembly lines remains poorly understood, especially for NRPS/PKS hybrids. Here, we provide substantial evidence for a remarkable cluster&#8208;mixing event involving three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), resulting in the emergence of novel peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids that were named minutumamides. By combining retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis with structure&#8208;guided genome mining, we could discover a potential evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis. In addition, we were able to trace nostopeptolide&#8208;related module and domain blocks in various other biosynthetic pathways, indicating a surprisingly vivid mixing and matching of biosynthesis genes in the evolution of NRPS and cis&#8208;acyltransferase PKS/NRPS pathways, which was previously regarded as a unique feature of trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS. These remarkable insights into the evolutionary plasticity of NRPS&#8208;PKS assembly lines provide valuable guidance for pathway engineers looking for productive combinations that yield &#8220;nonnatural&#8221; hybrid natural products.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Weakly Solvating Dinitrile Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Lasting Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance weakly&#8208;solvating dinitrile&#8208;based solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes with weakened hybrid solvation are designed by a combination of tailored weak solvents and a polymer network with short ethylene oxide side chains, which enables lithium metal batteries with excellent electrochemical properties and stable fast discharge capability at room temperature.








Abstract
The development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) relies on advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, mechanical flexibility, and light weight; however, their practical use is hindered by limited ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical stability window, and suboptimal cycling performance. Herein, we present a class of weakly&#8208;solvating dinitrile&#8208;based SPEs (DBSPEs) composed of a poly(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl acrylate) network coupled with structurally modulated dinitrile solvents. Through rationale molecular engineering, the synergistic combination of short ethylene oxide side chains and weakly coordinating dinitrile solvents enables weak hybrid solvation of lithium ions, thereby facilitating rapid ion migration and uniform lithium deposition. The optimized DBSPE&#8208;2 exhibits a high ionic conductivity (&#8764;2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and an extremely wide electrochemical window (&#8764;5.7&#160;V). Notably, the Li||DBSPE&#8208;2||Li symmetric cell yields stable lithium plating/stripping over 6900 h at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 under ambient conditions (26&#160;&#176;C). When paired with LiFePO&#8324; in a full cell, the LMBs deliver a superior fast&#8208;charging capability, realizing 80.78% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 2.0 C rate. This work provides fundamental insights into the solvation structure and accordingly realizes long&#8208;lasting LMBs with weak solvents.

         <title>Enhancing C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage of Glycerol Electrooxidation Through Spin&#8208;Selective Electron Donation in&#160;Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox Heterostructural Nanosheets</title>

         <dc:description>
The &#8220;spin&#8208;selective electron donation&#8221; strategy effectively modulates the electronic states of Pd's d orbitals (dz2${d_{{z^2}}}$ and dxy) through distinct pathway: &#963;&#8208;donation from low&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g6eg0) and &#960;&#8208;donation from high&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g5eg1).








Abstract
As a 4d transition metal, the spin state of Pd is extremely difficult to directly regulate for the optimized d orbital states owing to the strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect and further extended d orbital. Herein, we devise a &#8220;spin&#8208;selective electron donation&#8221; strategy to tune specific d orbital electrons of Pd inspired by the Dewar&#8722;Chatt&#8722;Duncanson model theory. Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridges with different spin&#8208;states of CoIII have been constructed in a series of Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox HNSs with tunable Co content. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that low&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g6eg0) with fully occupied t2g orbitals and empty dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ orbitals can accurately alter the dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ electron of Pd by &#963;&#8208;donation via the Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridge. In contrast, the unfilled dxy orbital of high&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g5eg1) is essential for controlling the dxy electron of Pd via &#960;&#8208;donation. Benefiting from dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ state optimization by &#963;&#8208;donation, Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Co4.0 delivers superior performance toward various bio&#8208;alcohols (ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol) with enhanced C&#9472;C bond cleavage. Furthermore, coupling the glycerol oxidation reaction with the CO2 reduction reaction (GOR||CO2RR), the electricity consumption of GOR||CO2RR drops 46.4% compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art system (OER||CO2RR). Moreover, anodic Faraday efficiency (FE) of formic acid can be attainable at more than 90% at low voltage regions.

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement Driven Emissive Aggregate Densification Enabling Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Hydrogels with Ultrastretchability and Crack&#8208;Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular confinement&#8208;entanglement synergy strategy to drive emissive aggregate densification is presented to produce long&#8208;lifetime room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels with ultrastretchability and crack&#8208;tolerance. The hydrogels exhibit intense afterglow with ultralong phosphorescence lifetime up to&#160;1.1&#160;s under room conditions, and show extreme uniaxial/biaxial (21&#160;000%/10&#160;000%) stretchability with a fracture energy as high as 157&#160;kJ m&#8315;.2








Abstract
Polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels are emerging candidates for many advanced photonic applications. Unfortunately, phosphorescence of the introduced RTP chromophores can easily be quenched in water&#8208;swollen hydrogel networks, limiting their luminescence performance and application adaptability. Herein, we propose a supramolecular confinement&#8208;entanglement synergy strategy to produce ultrastretchable RTP hydrogels by in&#8208;situ polymerizing high&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;(acryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammonium chloride (AETC) in the presence of preassembled 4&#8208;biphenylboronic acid@&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (4&#8208;BB@&#946;&#8208;CD) emissive aggregates. The hyper&#8208;entangled poly(AETC) (PAETC) chains, formed under water&#8208;limiting conditions, synergistically densify the 4&#8208;BB@&#946;&#8208;CD aggregates through supramolecular confinement, effectively suppressing molecular vibrations and stabilizing triplet states. Impressively, the hydrogels exhibit intense afterglow and ultralong phosphorescence lifetime up to&#160;1.1&#160;s under room conditions. Crucially, the entanglement&#8208;dominated physical network free of static chemical crosslinking enables continuing chain disentanglement during stretching for efficient energy dissipation. Segment length between physical entanglement points can thus be significantly enlarged to reduce network fracture and avoid crack propagation, achieving record&#8208;breaking uniaxial/biaxial (21&#160;000%/10&#160;000%) stretchability. Even the notched hydrogels are capable of being unprecedentedly stretched to 20&#160;500% and exhibit a fracture energy as high as 157&#160;kJ m&#8315;2, demonstrating intrinsic crack&#8208;tolerance. This study opens new avenues of polymeric RTP hydrogels by bringing superior mechanical performance and should merit their application exploration.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Poly(adipate)Esters via Catalytic Isomerizing Dual Hydroesterificative Polymerization of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step production of aliphatic polyesters: An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed isomerizing dual hydroesterificative polymerization (IDHP) strategy was developed for direct poly(adipate)ester synthesis from readily available feedstocks of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, diols, and carbon monoxide. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the IDHP exhibited remarkable efficiency in producing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyesters.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(adipate)esters, are attracting substantial attention as sustainable materials due to their degradability, recyclability, and versatility in various applications. However, the conventional production of poly(adipate)esters relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes and petroleum&#8208;derived adipic acid (AA), whose synthesis poses environmental concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions. Herein, we introduce a novel Pd&#8208;catalyzed isomerizing dual hydroesterificative polymerization (IDHP) strategy for direct poly(adipate)ester synthesis from readily available feedstocks of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, diols, and carbon monoxide. Key to success lay in the utilization of an electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligand with bulky steric hindrance, which efficiently facilitated linear&#8208;selective isomerizing hydroesterification. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the isomerizing hydroesterificative polymerization exhibited remarkable efficiency in producing poly(adipate)esters. The resulting poly(adipate)esters possess a similar structure compared to those produced by traditional polycondensation. With abundant feedstocks and atom&#8208;economy, this methodology provides a practical and eco&#8208;friendly approach to the production of poly(adipate)esters with varied microstructures.

         <title>Unexpected Redox Role of WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 Catalysts for Selective Reduction of NO by Forming V&#8211;W Dinuclear Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the NH3&#8208;SCR reaction over V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalyst, WO3 not only serves as an acidic promoter and structural regulator, but also plays a redox role. The WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5.








Abstract
Promoters can greatly improve the activity of catalysts; however, the mechanism by which they interact with the primary catalyst to enhance catalytic activity is not always clear. It has been widely demonstrated that WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts acts as a promoter to enhance the surface acidity and regulate the dispersion of active V2O5 species, while it is believed that the redox process takes place entirely at the V sites in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR). Here, by combining in situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we validate that the WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect in NH3&#8208;SCR by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5. This study sheds new light on a long&#8208;standing puzzle regarding the role of WO3 as a promoter and hence advances the understanding of the working principle of V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts.

         <title>Selective CO Electroreduction to Multicarbon Oxygenates Over Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag Sites in Alkaline Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the *OH cleavage of *COCOH toward *COO, thereby enhancing the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CO electroreduction. CO electrolysis over the optimized CuAg catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at a current density of 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2 in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to produce multicarbon (C2+) oxygenates using renewable electricity is a promising carbon utilization pathway. However, the performance of this process suffers from low C2+ oxygenates selectivity and insufficient current density. Here, we employed a Cu&#8211;Ag bimetallic strategy to enhance the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CORR in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer at ampere&#8208;level current densities. The Cu&#8211;Ag catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering feature atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface, which are key to promoting the formation of C2+ oxygenates. Increasing Ag content favors C2+ oxygenates formation while inhibiting ethylene production. The optimized Cu2Ag catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the dissociation of *COCOH to *CCO, thus favoring C2+ oxygenates formation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered CRISPR/Cas12a for Genomic Editing and Tumor Regression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for gene editing is introduced. The machinery is applied for endogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) gene editing and for in vitro disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene. The machinery is used for in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors, resulting in effective apoptosis and necrosis of the tumor tissues.








Abstract
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for in vitro and in vivo gene editing is introduced. The system consists of a caged, inactive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl phosphate ester photo&#8208;responsive crRNA, which, upon light&#8208;induced deprotection, yields the active CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing machinery (LAC12aGE). The LAC12aGE system induces specific thymidine&#8208;rich (TTTN) protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;guided double&#8208;stranded breaks in genomic DNA, which upon non&#8208;homologous end&#8208;joining lead to gene repair. The LAC12aGE machinery is applied for gene editing of an exogenous dual fluorescent reporter gene in living cells, as well as the endogenous gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 1. In addition, the LAC12aGE is applied for in vitro gene editing and disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene in HepG2 cells, where knockout of the HGF gene results in inhibited cell proliferation and migration, as well as enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, the in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors by the LAC12aGE machinery is demonstrated. The cyclic temporal development of the LAC12aGE system in tumors shows effective inhibition of tumor growth and enhanced apoptosis/necrosis of tumor tissues compared to control systems.

         <title>Green Electrosynthesis of Hydroxylamines via CuS Suppressing N&#9472;O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic method for synthetic organic hydroxylamines was firstly reported from the reduction of oximes on a CuS catalyst. Mechanistic investigations revealed that CuS owns well absorption energy for N&#9472;O bond which is difficult for reductive cleavage, thus it could suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation. This work provides a blueprint for next&#8208;generation green and sustainable organic electrosynthetic strategies.








Abstract
Organic hydroxylamines, pivotal intermediates in pharmaceutical and polymer chemistry, face persistent challenges in selective synthesis. Its main difficulty lies in the strong repulsion between the lone pair electrons on the N and O atoms, which makes their N&#9472;O bond easy to break, leading to a over&#8208;reduction to amine compounds. Here, we present a green electrocatalytic strategy for the first time that converts oximes to hydroxylamines over CuS. Specially, N&#8208;benzylhydroxylamine was achieved with 95% conversion and 80% selectivity from benzaldoxime at &#8722;0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Mechanistic investigations reveal that CuS can optimize the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates, making the N&#9472;O bond more difficult to cleave during the electrocatalytic hydrogenation, thus leading to a high selectivity formation of hydroxylamines. This methodology is successfully extended to other hydroxylamines and further enables the unprecedented synthesis of organic hydroxylamines from nitric oxide gas. Our work establishes a sustainable electrosynthetic platform for hydroxylamines synthesis without organic solvents and additional reduction agents, providing new insights for modern green chemical synthesis.

         <title>closo&#8208;Carboranyl Analogs of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines: Direct Synthesis from Alkenes via EnT&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to directly synthesize closo&#8208;carboranyl analogs of medicinal chemically important &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines from alkenes is reported. This reaction is enabled by the first formation of closo&#8208;carboranyl radicals by energy transfer (EnT) catalysis and its unique mechanistic features. Several analogs of known bioactive compounds were obtained after downstream modifications.








Abstract
closo&#8208;Carboranes are icosahedral carbon&#8211;boron clusters with unique properties and broad applicability. They particularly stand out in the context of drug development as privileged structural motifs for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and as highly hydrophobic bioisosteres for the rotational volume of phenyl rings. Herein, we unveil the synthesis of N&#8208;protected carboranyl analogs of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines&#8212;widely found structural motifs in biologically active molecules&#8212;via a one&#8208;step alkene difunctionalization approach. Key for our success were the enabling mechanistic characteristics of energy transfer catalysis which we have used for the first time to generate closo&#8208;carboranyl radicals. Downstream modifications gave a series of analogs of amino acids and known N&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists.

         <title>Efficient Bicarbonate Electrolysis to Formate Enabled via Ionomer Surface Modification in Cation Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolyzer configuration, featuring a single cation exchange membrane and surface&#8208;modified bismuth catalyst, is designed for bicarbonate electrolysis. This configuration enables highly efficient production of formate and significantly reduced operating voltage, providing a potential solution for direct CO2 utilization from point source emissions.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a promising method for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals, with formate being a particularly viable product. However, current gas&#8208;fed CO2RR systems rely on highly pure CO2 feed gases and are incompatible with point&#8208;source CO2 emissions without prior capture and concentration. Bicarbonate electrolysis offers a potential solution by bridging the gap between CO2 emissions and utilization. However, existing electrolyzer configurations, especially those using bipolar membranes (BPM), require high working voltages and suffer from poor energy efficiency. Here, we present a cation exchange membrane (CEM)&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) incorporating a surface&#8208;modified bismuth cathode catalyst. The success of this approach is attributed to two key factors: the use of the positively charged ionomer PiperION for surface modification, which creates a favorable cathode microenvironment; the single CEM that enhances proton flux from the anode to the cathode while reducing ionic impedance. The CEM&#8208;based MEA demonstrates a formate faradaic efficiency of up to 80%, with a significant 1.5&#160;V reduction in operating voltage compared to BPM&#8208;based MEAs at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the CEM&#8208;based MEA exhibits excellent tolerance to O2 impurities and maintains high performance even with simulated flue gas, making it suitable for direct CO2 utilization from point sources.

         <title>Remote Control of Eukaryotic Gene Expression by a Modular Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive RNA Toolkit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular RNA&#8208;based sonogenetic toolkit enables remote control of gene expression in eukaryotes by releasing small molecule modulators from ultrasound&#8208;responsive carriers. These modulators activate engineered mRNA elements such as riboswitches, leading to tunable protein expression. The system functions across diverse cell types and responds to a wide ultrasound frequency range, offering a versatile platform for biocompatible, non&#8208;invasive regulation of cellular processes.








Abstract
Achieving remote control of biological processes remains a significant challenge in genetics. Although ultrasound has been employed to remotely regulate biological functions by targeting mechanosensitive ion channels, existing systems are constrained by the limited responsiveness of specific channels to specific ultrasound frequencies and their applicability to only a few cell types. Sonogenetics has shown promise for promoter control, thereby regulating gene transcription in eukaryotes. Here, we introduce a new modular toolkit for regulating gene expression using ultrasound&#8208;responsive RNA carriers capable of releasing small molecule modulators in response to a broad spectrum of ultrasound frequencies. The cells contain engineered mRNA structures encoding riboswitches or aptazymes, which respond specifically to these small molecule modulators finally controlling downstream protein expression by biocompatible ultrasound. This toolkit is versatile, functioning across various eukaryotic systems&#8212;from yeast to mammalian cells&#8212;and offers control over gene expression by regulating mRNA translation. We demonstrated that this sonogenetic toolkit robustly modulates gene expression, achieving up to a six&#8208;fold downregulation of protein levels in response to ultrasound stimulation. By expanding the application of sonogenetics across eukaryotes, this RNA&#8208;based toolkit might provide a promising platform for remotely controlling protein function in specific tissues through on&#8208;demand ultrasound activation in the future.

         <title>Unveiling Zinc Stripping and Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the zinc stripping process is more prone to cause severe side reactions than the deposition process, resulting in the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; In this regard, a dynamic molecular protection strategy is proposed to regulate the zinc stripping and deposition processes simultaneously, achieving long&#8208;lasting protection of the zinc anodes.








Abstract
The unstable zinc anode is a key challenge limiting the cycle life of rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The current research primarily focuses on the zinc plating process, with strategies to induce uniform zinc deposition for a stable zinc anode. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc stripping process has a more significant impact on the subsequent zinc deposition, which exacerbates the formation of by&#8208;products, dendrites, and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; Therefore, we propose using aspartyl&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester (APM) molecules to regulate the zinc stripping, achieving uniform stripping of the zinc anode by increasing the stripping overpotential across high&#8208;energy barriers. Simultaneously, its localized hydrophobic functional groups effectively inhibit the byproducts triggered by solvated water molecules. The experimental results show that the Zn&#8208;APM symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, with stable cycling over 6500&#160;h (&gt;9 months) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 700&#160;h at 70% zinc utilization with 10&#160;&#181;m zinc. In addition, the Zn&#8208;APM||Zn0.58V2O5&#183;H2O full cell exhibits 80% capacity retention after 500 cycles at a loading of 8.1&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Tuning the Crystallization and Photothermal Aging Chemistry of CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 for Inorganic Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization and photothermal aging chemistry of CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 perovskites were regulated by guanidinoacetic acid for 16.93% efficiency and T80 of 1300 h at 65 &#176;C, thus leading to stable tandem as well.








Abstract
The poor performance of inorganic narrow bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinders the development of inorganic perovskite tandem solar cells (IPTSCs). We modulate the crystallization and photothermal aging chemistry for CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 (1.31&#160;eV) with guanidinoacetic acid (GCA) to develop IPTSC. The CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:GCA PSC reaches an efficiency of 16.93% and maintains an initial efficiency of &#8764;80% (T80) for 1300&#160;h under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 65&#160;&#176;C. We identify that there are not only ionic migration species (I&#8722;, I3&#8722;) but also molecular migration species (SnI4, I2) for CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 correlated to the photothermal dynamics. For CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 film, the intractable pinholes accelerate the iodine migration to the electrode and photothermal degradation. The photodegradation of PbI2 produces I2 and then promotes the Sn2+ oxidation to Sn4+, causing tin migration in the form of SnI4 to accumulate at the electron transport layer/perovskite interface, and in turn generating more pinholes and Sn&#8208;Pb segregation. In CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:GCA film, due to the coordination bonds with Pb/Sn cations and hydrogen bonds with I&#8722; ions, GCA incorporation&#8208;induced pinhole&#8208;free morphology can significantly suppress ion/molecule migration. Combined with CsPbI2Br subcell, two&#8208;terminal IPTSC delivers an efficiency of 22.18%, accompanied by T80&#160;=&#160;850&#160;h under MPPT at 65&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>An All&#8208;in&#8208;One Nanohole Array for Size&#8208;Exclusive Trapping and High&#8208;Throughput Digital Counting of Single Extracellular Vesicles for Non&#8208;Invasive Cancer Screening</title>

         <dc:description>
An easily fabricated single sEV analysis platform for early bladder cancer (BCa) diagnosis is developed. The platform integrates an EV&#8208;imprinted gold nanohole array to selectively trap individual sEVs and spatially enhance their Raman spectra. The origin of each sEV is accurately classified for BCa diagnosis. BCa&#8208;related signatures are further extracted using an explainable AI model, facilitating BCa discrimination from other malignancies.








Abstract
The analysis of single small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) could distinguish the heterogeneity of sEVs thus better extract tumor&#8208;related signatures. Current protocols for the analysis of single sEV rely mainly on the advanced techniques and require lengthy isolation procedures, limiting applications in clinical diagnosis. Herein, we developed a one&#8208;step procedure for rapid isolation of single sEVs from urine, along with an analytical pipeline for the diagnosis of early bladder cancer (BCa). Single sEVs are isolated by an EV&#8208;imprinted gold nanohole (EI&#8208;AuNH) array that selectively traps individual sEVs and spatially enhances their Raman spectra. After the invalid spectral data from incomplete or absent sEVs was eliminated using Smart&#8208;Filter, a convolutional neural network model identifies the origin of the spectra and generates a digital count matrix for each patient. By integrating the digital count data of both tumor&#8208;associated and normal sEVs, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.37% in early diagnosis of BCa. Feature extraction using explainable AI identified nine BCa&#8208;related signatures, with noticeable reduction on cholesterol and lipids in BCa&#8208;associated sEVs. These signatures could further distinguish BCa from other cancers. Overall, the present non&#8208;invasive and highly accurate diagnosis platform may revolutionize clinical disease diagnostics through simplified single sEV isolation and advanced modeling.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Mediated Rearrangement of Bis(alkynyl)boranes: B&#9472;C Activation versus C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(alkynyl)boranes bearing different B&#8208;substituents reacted with Cp*2Ti(Me3SiCCSiMe3), leading to the formation of B&#9472;C activation products (top right) and C&#9472;H activation products (bottom right), respectively.








Abstract
Reactions between Rosenthal's titanocene (Cp2Ti) and decamethyltitanocene (Cp*2Ti) synthons with various bis(alkynyl)boranes were investigated. A series of titanium&#8208;fused boracyclobutenes were obtained through the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)2NB(CCR)2 or PhB(CCPh)2. This represents the first realization of approaching this structural motif via the rearrangement of bis(alkynyl)boranes within the coordination sphere of a d&#8208;block metal. These findings break the previous limitation that the boron substituent must be an amino group. Furthermore, the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)PhNB(CCPh)2 or (Mes2B)PhNB(CCPh)2 (Mes&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) led to the formation of novel tethered metallocene complexes, in which the titanacyclopentadiene structure is linked to one of the cyclopentadienyl groups via a &#9472;CH2&#9472;BR&#9472; bridge. Both experimental and theoretical studies provided insights into an unprecedented reaction mechanism. The process involves the initial formation of an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated bis(alkynyl)borane intermediate, which was detected and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This intermediate subsequently undergoes either B&#9472;Calkynyl bond activation or CMe&#9472;H activation of the Cp* ligand, leading to the formation of two distinct types of products.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dipeptide Surface Functionalization of Detonation Nanodiamond for Enhanced Control in Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a systematic investigation of novel zwitterionic dipeptide functionalized nanodiamonds to ensure colloidal stability over a broad pH range and in biological media. In vitro experiments in 2D and 3D cell cultures revealed a dipeptide&#8208;dependent biocompatibility and cellular uptake. 








Abstract
Utilizing nanoparticles as innovative theranostic agents for biomedical applications requires full control over the material's properties to dictate their interactions within a biological environment. Owing to its versatile surface chemistry and high biocompatibility, nanodiamond (ND) represents a promising platform for novel healthcare treatments. To ensure the performance and safety of NDs, their properties and behavior must remain unchanged upon administration, a key challenge in nanomedicine. Recently, zwitterionic surface modifications have emerged as new strategies to substantially improve protein&#8208;repelling properties and biocompatibility of nanomaterials. Using for the first time covalently conjugated zwitterionic dipeptides as surface modulators for ND particles, we were able to provide a readily accessible, reproducible, and tunable functionalization. The obtained particles demonstrate enhanced colloidal stability and conservation of particle size over a broad pH range and in different protein&#8208;containing media compared to the starting material. By simple selection of different dipeptides, we can carefully tailor the biocompatibility and cellular uptake of functionalized NDs. We reveal the functionalized NDs&#8217; behavior in biologically relevant 3D organotypic models and how different dipeptide&#8208;functionalized NDs interact with squamous epithelium ex vivo. The results pave the way for various applications, e.g., biosensing, tissue engineering or targeted drug delivery of these highly biologically suitable nanoparticles.

         <title>Streamlining SuFEx Inhibitor Development: A Unified Approach Using Photolabile and Orthogonal Sulfinate Protecting Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Study outlines the discovery and selection of sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs) based on their overall stability, ease of synthesis, and simple deprotection conditions, including two novel, photolabile SPGs that can be directly converted to the sulfonyl fluoride (SFs) using light and selectfluor. This streamlined approach to SF synthesis allows for their incorporation at any point in a synthetic endeavor, enabling access to complex SF&#8208;containing small molecules.








Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides (SFs) have gained significant importance due to their classification as a click reaction and therefore have seen increased use in drug discovery and biochemistry. Their use, however, is complicated by the methods by which they are synthesized and their general synthetic instability. This results in SFs being introduced late in a synthetic route with minimal structural diversity. Masking the reactivity of a sulfonyl fluoride by protecting the parent sulfinate is one method to ameliorate these issues. Current sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs), however, possess limited stability. This study outlines the discovery and selection of SPGs based on their overall stability, ease of synthesis, and simple deprotection conditions. This includes the discovery of two novel, photolabile SPGs, para&#8208;methoxybenzyl Rongalite and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl Rongalite that can be directly converted to the sulfonyl fluoride using light and selectfluor. Along with known SPG, 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl sulfone (SES), all three SPGs were found to possess broad stability when exposed to numerous common synthetic conditions and are easily coupled to aryl halides from their sulfinate salt precursor. Their utility is then demonstrated in the synthesis of SPG containing building blocks that are incorporated into several bioactive small molecules.

         <title>Engineering Charge Polarized Au Sites for Low&#8208;Temperature Acetylene Hydrochlorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;supported Au catalyst with polarized charge distribution enables low&#8208;temperature vinyl chloride synthesis, where a durable Au&#948;&#8315;&#8594;Au&#948;&#8314;&#8594;Au0 transition boosts catalytic performance.








Abstract
Cationic gold catalyzed acetylene hydrochlorination represents a classical landmark in eliminating global mercury pollution, but their sustainable implementation is hindered by acetylene&#8208;dependence design criteria and high operating temperatures. Herein, a platform of carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atoms Au catalysts (Au/BC and Au/NC) with polarized charge characteristics are developed via engineering Au sites with hosted B, N configurations. The negatively charged Au/BC catalyst unlocks the low&#8208;temperature inactivity (413&#8211;423K) of the Au/NC catalyst while exhibiting superior catalytic performance in the 433&#8211;473K operating temperature range. We confirm that the classical scaling relationships on acetylene can be broken by narrowing the adsorption capacity between acetylene and HCl on Au&#948;&#8315; sites via facilitating the back&#8208;donation of d electrons into the antibonding orbitals of acetylene. Prolonging the durability of Au catalysts is achieved through preceding an additional robust Au&#948;&#8315; &#8594; Au&#948;&#8314; cycle prior to the classic Au&#948;&#8314; &#8594; Au0 route. This work opens a promising avenue for low temperature vinyl chloride production.

         <title>Modulating Electric Double Layers via Polymer Electric Dipole Effects to Enhance Stability in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electric dipole effect of polymers alters the conformation of the electric double layer by expelling solvent molecules, which enriches the inner Helmholtz layer with anions and results in a compressed electric double layer. This modification changes the Na electrodeposition mode and enhances SEI robustness, enabling reversible Na plating/stripping.








Abstract
The interfacial instability of Na metal anodes poses a significant barrier to the practical applications of sodium metal batteries. According to electric double layer (EDL) theory, the potential difference in the Helmholtz layer critically affects electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which governs the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition and the Na deposition process. Herein, we leverage the electric dipole effect of polymers, formed via in situ polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA), which preferentially adsorbs on the Na metal surface, to modulate the conformation of the EDL. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that poly&#8208;BA facilitates the formation of a more compressed diffuse layer and reduces the potential difference in the Helmholtz layer. This compressed EDL with the change of species derives homogeneous SEI, enabling reversible Na plating/stripping. As a result, the poly&#8208;BA quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte extends the lifespan of the Na||Na cell to 3500&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8315;2. Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells maintain stable cycling over 1500 cycles, with a capacity retention of 87.6% at 5&#160;C. Our findings indicate that modulating the EDL structure via the electric dipole effect of polymers enables uniform Na deposition, offering a promising strategy for designing electrolytes for practical quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) based on an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine scaffold is described. While C5&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituents yield stable NHOs, alkenyl or alkynyl groups at C5 induce 6&#8208;endo cyclization to form (dihydro)imidazo[2,1,5&#8208;de]quinolizines with strong paratropic ring currents. These heterocycles undergo low&#8208;potential oxidation to produce fluorescent radical cations, expanding the scope of fluorescent organic radicals.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) based on an imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine scaffold is described. While C5-alkyl or aryl substituents yield stable NHOs, alkenyl or alkynyl groups at C5 induce 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; cyclization to form (dihydro)imidazo[2,1,5-&lt;i&gt;de&lt;/i&gt;]quinolizines with strong paratropic ring currents. These heterocycles undergo low-potential oxidation to produce fluorescent radical cations, expanding the scope of fluorescent organic radicals.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven O&#8208;Glycosylation with Selenoglycosides Mediated by Chalcogen Bonding to Umemoto's Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light irradiation of solutions of phenylselenoglycosides and Umemoto's reagent in the presence of alcohols results in often high&#8208;yielding formation of O&#8208;glycosidic products. Experimental and computational work suggests that chalcogen&#8208;bonded electron&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes are critical intermediates in this process which may proceed through photoinduced electron transfer.








Abstract
The activation of chalcogenoglycosides for O&#8208;glycosylation typically involves strong electrophiles requiring low temperature. Herein, we demonstrate that visible&#8208;light irradiation of selenoglycosides in the presence of Umemoto's reagent results in often high&#8208;yielding O&#8208;glycosylation. We provide evidence that this process is mediated by a novel mode of reactivity, specifically photoinduced electron transfer within a chalcogen&#8208;bonded complex.

         <title>6H&#8208;Intermediate Phase Enabled Slow Crystal Growth of Tin Halide Perovskites for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We controlled the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. High&#8208;quality FASnI2Br perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects, which resulted in an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000&#8197;lux.







Abstract
The rapid expansion of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) has driven significant advancements in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which provide power to wireless IoT devices. Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have garnered significant attention for IPVs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties without the environmental risks of lead exposure. However, THPs face challenges in controlling their fast crystallization process. Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H&#8208;intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br&#8208;4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase formation. Thus, high&#8208;quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs.

         <title>Diacylation of Peptides Enables the Construction of Functional Vesicles for Drug&#8208;Carrying Liposomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here we show that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized functional vesicles. The use of integrin&#8208;binding peptide motifs as head groups enables the construction of drug&#8208;carrying liposomes that are specifically taken up by cells.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells by enzymatic diacylation of non&#8208;amphiphilic polar head groups. Analogous non&#8208;enzymatic processes may have been relevant at the origin of life and could have practical utility in membrane synthesis. However, aqueous head group diacylation is challenging in the absence of enzymes. The use of charged peptides instead of canonical phospholipid head groups offers advantages with respect to ease of acylation and chemical diversity. Here we demonstrate that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables in situ synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized vesicles resembling cellular membranes. Diacylation occurs between non&#8208;amphiphilic peptides possessing an N&#8208;terminal cysteine, and acyl thioesters. Peptide head groups endow unique membrane functions, which is demonstrated by incorporation of an arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) motif, resulting in vesicle targeting to &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. The biocompatibility and functional group programmability of D&#8208;ALPs supports their broad utility as membrane mimetics.

         <title>Formation of the Diketopiperazine Moiety by a Distinct Condensation&#8208;Like Domain in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

The integration of structural biology, genetics, biochemistry, and computational chemistry revealed a specific mechanism by which a CT domain with the &#8220;PW&#215;&#215;&#215;DG&#8221; motif stabilizes an amidate intermediate through a protonated arginine residue R2776 outside the motif to mediate nucleophilic attack. The findings expand knowledge of C domain functions in non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are key enzymes in pharmaceutical synthesis, with condensation (C) domains catalyzing amide bond formation between aminoacyl substrates. However, recent research has elucidated that the catalytic capabilities of C domains extend beyond the traditional formation of peptide bonds. In this study, we elucidate the cyclization mechanism of the NRPS&#8208;derived natural products hangtaimycin (HTM), characterized by the formation of a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) moiety which involves an intramolecular vinylamide&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attack instead of an N&#8208;terminal amino group. This cyclization is catalyzed by a terminal condensation&#8208;like (CT) domain within the NRPS enzyme HtmB2. We investigated the evolutionary specificity of the HtmB2&#8208;CT within Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417. Employing a multidisciplinary analytical approach, we have delineated the molecular underpinnings of DKP formation within the HTM biosynthesis. This process is facilitated by residue R2776, which modulates the formation of reactive species and stabilizes the amidate through electrostatic interactions. Besides, we found a positive correlation between the alkaline strength of the residue at position 2776 and the activity of HtmB2&#8208;CT. Our study elucidates the formation mechanism of DKPs in NRPS&#8208;derived natural products, thereby bridging a critical gap in the structural and mechanistic understanding of this field.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Behavior by Single&#8208;site Pt on RuO2 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Glycolic Acid from Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Pt&#8208;doped RuO2 was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for synthesis of GA and H2 fuels from PET wastes. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA and H2 yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1 and 2.38&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, using a membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes into valuable glycolic acid (GA) is an ideal solution for resource utilization. However, simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the over&#8208;oxidation and C&#8722;C cleavage during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate. Herein, we develop an atomically isolated Pt on RuO2 (Pt1/RuO2) catalyst composed of high&#8208;density Pt&#8722;Ru interfaces that ensure single&#8208;site adsorption of EG, enrich surface *OH coverage and weaken *CO&#8722;CH2OH intermediate adsorption, thereby synergistically promoting GA generation. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 delivers a remarkable mass activity of 8.09&#8197;A/mgPt, as well as a high GA Faradaic efficiency (95.3&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.9&#8201;%). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1. In&#8208;depth theoretical and in situ spectroscopic investigations reveal the synergy between isolated Pt and oxophilic RuO2 plays a crucial role in high&#8208;efficiency EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. This study offers valuable insights for the rational design of advanced catalysts for GA synthesis from PET wastes via a single&#8208;site doped bimetallic strategy.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Acetaldehyde Production from CO2 and H2O via Synergistic Vacancies and Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of high bonding energy in photocatalytic CO2 conversion and the complexity and false positives in product detection associated with sacrificial agents, sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu are synergistically combined to enhance CO2 activation and lower the activation energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling on Cd0.6Zn0.4S, thereby achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents for CH3CHO production.







Abstract
Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is of great industrial importance and serves as a key intermediate in various organic transformations. Photocatalytic production of acetaldehyde from CO2 represents a sustainable route compared to conventional oxidation processes. However, current photocatalytic systems often face challenges, including limited product selectivity and dependence on sacrificial reagents. Here, we present a Cd0.6Zn0.4S (CZS) photocatalyst co&#8208;modified with sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu (Cu/CZS&#8722;Vs) for the efficient conversion of CO2 to acetaldehyde. Charge density analysis reveals that sulfur vacancies induce charge accumulation around the adjacent metal atoms, creating active sites that strongly anchor CO2 and H+, thereby promoting CO2 conversion while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The atomically dispersed Cu sites facilitate the conversion of key intermediates (i.e., *CHO and *CO) to the crucial C2 intermediate *OCCHO, which can subsequently be converted to acetaldehyde. As a result, this catalyst achieves an acetaldehyde yield of 121.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of ca. 80&#8201;% via photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents, along with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.53&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, underscoring its potential for practical CO2 conversion applications. These results are expected to pave the way for future developments in green chemical processes.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Reactivity in Dense Methane&#8208;Nitrogen Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

CH4 and N2 are abundant molecules in our solar system and are the primary constituents of Titan's atmosphere. Under extreme pressures and temperatures within a diamond anvil cell, CH4 and N2 are demonstrated to react to form a range of compounds, dependent on the conditions and initial concentrations. This provides valuable insight into the complexity of the C&#8722;N&#8722;H ternary system under planetary conditions.







Abstract
Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are among the most abundant elements in the solar system, and our understanding of their interactions is fundamental to prebiotic chemistry. CH4 and N2 are the simplest archetypical molecules formed by these elements and are both markedly stable under extremes of pressure. Through a series of diamond anvil cell experiments supported by density functional theory calculations, we observe diverse compound formation and reactivity in the CH4&#8208;N2 binary system at high pressure. Above 7&#8197;GPa two concentration&#8208;dependent molecular compounds emerge, (CH4)5N2 and (CH4)7(N2)8, held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Strikingly, further compression at room temperature irreversibly breaks the N2 triple bond, inducing the dissociation of CH4 above 140&#8197;GPa, with the near&#8208;quenched samples revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of strong covalently bonded C&#8722;N&#8722;H networks. High temperatures vastly reduce the required pressure to promote the reactivity between CH4 and N2, with NH3 forming together with longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons at 14&#8197;GPa and 670&#8197;K, further decomposing into powdered diamond when temperatures exceed 1200&#8197;K. These results exemplify how pressure&#8208;driven chemistry can cause unexpected complexity in the most simple molecular precursors.

         <title>Multisite Cross&#8208;Linked Ligand Suppressing Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dot&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid molecules have been proposed to simultaneously passivate non&#8208;radiative defects and stabilize the surface of perovskite QDs, enabling efficient and stable green perovskite QLEDs with a peak EQE of over 25&#8201;% and an operating lifetime of more than 1300&#8197;h, among the highest for perovskite QLEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs), as promisingly solution&#8208;processed emitters, have produced impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the operational stability of perovskite QD&#8208;based LEDs (QLEDs) is still limited by severe ion migration. Here, we propose a multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) molecules to simultaneously reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration in QLEDs. Meanwhile, the introduction of cross&#8208;linked LA ligands can reduce the roughness and contact potential difference variation of QD films, which facilitates the injection and recombination of carriers in devices. As a result, the colour&#8208;saturated green CsPbBr3&#8208;based QLED deliver a maximum EQE of 25.6&#8201;% together with an operational lifetime of 1340&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the most efficient and stable perovskite LEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs. The improvement in device stability is attributed to the reduced ion migration, which is confirmed by analyzing the current behavior of QLEDs and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. This study provides a facile strategy for mitigating halide ion migration in perovskite fields toward more efficient and stable perovskite QLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A multisite cross-linked ligand strategy&lt;/b&gt; using &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-lipoic acid molecules have been proposed to simultaneously passivate non-radiative defects and stabilize the surface of perovskite QDs, enabling efficient and stable green perovskite QLEDs with a peak EQE of over 25&#8201;% and an operating lifetime of more than 1300&#8197;h, among the highest for perovskite QLEDs based on cross-linked QDs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite quantum dots (QDs), as promisingly solution-processed emitters, have produced impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the operational stability of perovskite QD-based LEDs (QLEDs) is still limited by severe ion migration. Here, we propose a multisite cross-linked ligand strategy using &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-lipoic acid (LA) molecules to simultaneously reduce non-radiative recombination and suppress ion migration in QLEDs. Meanwhile, the introduction of cross-linked LA ligands can reduce the roughness and contact potential difference variation of QD films, which facilitates the injection and recombination of carriers in devices. As a result, the colour-saturated green CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based QLED deliver a maximum EQE of 25.6&#8201;% together with an operational lifetime of 1340&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the most efficient and stable perovskite LEDs based on cross-linked QDs. The improvement in device stability is attributed to the reduced ion migration, which is confirmed by analyzing the current behavior of QLEDs and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry. This study provides a facile strategy for mitigating halide ion migration in perovskite fields toward more efficient and stable perovskite QLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multifunctional Molecular Modulated Strategy Featuring Novel Li+ Transport Centers and Li2O&#8208;Rich SEI Layer for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin is introduced to simultaneously boost the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Advanced characterization techniques have revealed that coumarin preserves the mechanical properties of the PEO framework, provides new Li+ hopping centers and constructs a Li2O&#8208;rich SEI layer with excellent Li+ transport dynamics, which are crucial for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
The poor ionic conductivity and interfacial instability severely limit the application of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. In this work, we introduce a multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin, which simultaneously boosts the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;coumarin (PLC) membrane. Unlike conventional additives that diminish PEO's crystallinity, coumarin, with its higher Li+ adsorption energy and stronger dipole moments, acts as a novel &#8216;carrier&#8217; for Li+ without compromising the mechanical properties of the PEO matrix. Its synergistic effect with PEO creates a more efficient Li+ transport pathway to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Simultaneously, coumarin as a sacrificial agent by utilizing its carbonyl group, preferentially reacts with lithium metal to prevent the decomposition of PEO and lithium salts. Furthermore, coumarin acts as an in situ Li2O&#8208;inducer, facilitating the formation of a dense Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with faster ion diffusion kinetics at the interface. The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000&#8197;h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO4 battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention ratio of 93&#8201;% after 550&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Electron Cloud and Space Structure Symmetry Induced Microscopic Split&#8208;phase Interface for High&#8208;rate and Long&#8208;term Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to constrain H2O activity and accelerate Zn2+ migration, which remarkably solves the interfacial side reactions and uneven Zn deposition caused by unstable EDL, especially under fast mass&#8208;charge transfer at high&#8208;rate conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes and Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with excellent endurance.







Abstract
Weak dipole interactions between highly symmetric H2O molecules and SO42&#8722; species are the root cause of unstable electric double layer (EDL), which triggers the hydrogen evolution reaction and Zn dendrite formation, significantly impeding the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we designed a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface (MSPI) by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to suppress interfacial side reactions and achieve uniform Zn deposition. The structurally asymmetric methylurea (MU) molecules possess both hydrophobic methyl and hydrophilic amino groups, which disrupt the continuity of H&#8208;bonding network and the aggregation state of H2O molecules, resulting in peculiar nanoscale core&#8211;shell&#8208;like clusters. Such a unique structure further evolves into MSPI at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, ensuring a continuously stable EDL. The DRT analysis and MD simulation confirmed that MSPI structure is composed of the outer H2O layer and the inner MU layer, which greatly suppress the activity of H2O molecules and accelerate Zn2+ migration. Consequently, the formulated electrolyte exhibited remarkable cycle reversibility over 1500&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, achieving a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity of 30&#8197;Ah&#8901;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, its feasibility was demonstrated by coupling with the I2@AC cathode, achieving an impressive 28,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Coordination Topology Design in Anion&#8208;Rich Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolyte, the equal molar dual&#8208;anion strategy expands the solvation energy level distribution and boosts the Li&#8208;ion transport. Moreover, a universal principle is found based on the coordination topology of the dual&#8208;anion combination: only the combination containing anion with the multi&#8208;coordination site can raise the Li&#8208;ion transport in such systems, supporting the design of high&#8208;rate lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;rich solvated structures are promising for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their good interfacial compatibility. Nevertheless, limited Li&#8208;ion transport of these electrolytes has hindered their high&#8208;rate application. Here we demonstrate that Li&#8208;ion transport in anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolytes could be facilitated by designing the coordination topology of anions in the solvation structure. Results show that, for a binary&#8208;anion electrolyte, equal&#8208;molar anions show the most expanded energy level distribution of solvation structures, thus reducing the Li&#8208;ion transport energy barrier, and resulting in a Li&#8208;ion conductivity even higher than that of the commercial carbonate electrolyte at a temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. More importantly, we identify a universal principle governing the Li&#8208;ion transport enhancement driven by anion configurations: only the combination of anions with multi&#8208;coordination sites shows facilitation in Li&#8208;ion transport, while the combination of centrosymmetric anions with the mono&#8208;coordination site harms it. The diversified anion&#8208;rich solvated structures also form stable interphases on the electrodes, enabling long&#8208;term cycling of 4.5&#8197;V LMBs at a high current density of 3.78&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Overall, our findings shine new light on developing practical electrolytes for energy&#8208;dense LMBs.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Induced Electrochemical Ion&#8208;Solvent Cointercalation in Pillared Titanate Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer&#8208;expansion of hydrogen tetratitanate is realized with organic pillars. Optimized atomistic configurations of the pillared materials are proposed by characterization with experiment and simulation. The nanoconfinement modification of HTO induces ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions with improved kinetics and increased storage capacity.







Abstract
Electrochemical ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions are an avenue to reach improved kinetics compared to the corresponding intercalation of desolvated ions. Here, we demonstrate the impact of different structural pillar molecules on the electrochemical Li+ intercalation mechanism in expanded hydrogen titanate (HTO) electrode materials. We show that interlayer&#8208;expansion of HTO with organic pillars can enable cointercalation reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Interlayer-expansion of hydrogen tetratitanate is realized with organic pillars. Optimized atomistic configurations of the pillared materials are proposed by characterization with experiment and simulation. The nanoconfinement modification of HTO induces ion-solvent cointercalation reactions with improved kinetics and increased storage capacity.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Polar&#8208;Functionalized Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silane protection strategy is developed to enable early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed efficient terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene and polar monomers. A series of polar functionalized polyolefin elastomers with high molecular weight and high 1&#8208;octene incorporation are successfully synthesized. This strategy shows comprehensive better performances than previously wide practiced aluminum protection strategy, leading to products with excellent mechanical and elastic properties, along with great practical applications.







Abstract
Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) are widely used for many applications including plastic toughening and encapsulating photovoltaic modules. The introduction of polar groups into POEs improves their compatibility and adhesion with polar components, but it is challenging to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polar&#8208;functionalized POEs (P&#8208;POEs) via copolymerization. Here, we report a silane protection strategy to enable the production of P&#8208;POEs (including an ethylene&#8208;based P&#8208;EPOE and a propylene&#8208;based P&#8208;PPOE) with widely tunable 1&#8208;octene incorporation ratios (7.4&#8211;19.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), appropriate polar monomer incorporation ratios (0.7&#8211;2.7 mol&#8201;%), melting points (63.8&#8211;99.8&#8201;&#176;C), and high molecular weights (up to 43.8&#215;104&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This approach involved the early transition metal&#8208;catalyzed terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene, and protected polar monomers. This silane protection strategy is superior to the previously widely practiced aluminum&#8208;based protection strategies in terms of polymerization activity, polymer molecular weight, comonomer incorporation, and product processibility. Most importantly, the P&#8208;POE products exhibited excellent mechanical properties and elasticity and served as high&#8208;performance compatibilizers and adhesives to enhance the functional applications of POEs.

         <title>Activating La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni Bridge in Ordered Macroporous Interface for Electrochemical Urea Wastewater Purification</title>

The La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge was constructed and activated in the three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous La2O3&#8208;NiO, which acted as a kind of superior anode catalyst in urea electrooxidation and purification. 3DOM morphology increased the contact surface of the material with the solution and accelerates mass transfer. The electron transfer from La to Ni was proved to accelerat the formation of active phase, C=O adsorption and N&#8722;H bond cleavage during the catalysis. It provides insights from the microscale to the macroscale level demonstrating how morphology engineering and La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge boost urea oxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater purification significantly aids in environmental protection, but it remains a considerable challenge in designing high performance anode urea oxidation electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a La&#8208;induced three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) NiO heterostructure to improve Ni sites electron density for urea electrooxidation by activating the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge. This material demonstrated exceptional performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, characterized by a low cell voltage (1.49&#8197;V @ 80&#8201;&#176;C) and 280&#8197;h stability test at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density (25&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed promising efficiency in urea wastewater purification. Permeation experiments revealed the crucial role of 3DOM morphological in facilitating mass transfer processes. A high valence nickel mechanism (HNM) on the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge during catalysis was proposed, based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Experimentally, in situ Raman and UV&#8208;vis spectra demonstrated that Ni active species Ni&#948;+ (&#948;&#8805;3) promote urea oxidation kinetics, while in situ ATR&#8208;IR proved strong adsorption of C=O with Ni sites and the enhancement of urea N&#8722;H bonds cleavage, supporting the HNM. This work enables us to underscore the critical importance of La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge with 3DOM architectures and promising contributions to urea wastewater purification.

         <title>An Adhesive Adaptation Layer Mitigates the Interfacial Instabilities of Rigid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical solid polymer electrolytes (H&#8208;SPEs) featuring an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) effectively mitigate interfacial instabilities in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries by reinforcing electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact and promoting uniform lithium deposition. This novel architecture demonstrates excellent cycling stability, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity retention over 960&#8197;cycles with high&#8208;loading NMC622 cathode.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely recognized as promising candidates for enabling solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with improved safety, high energy density, and extended cycling life. The traditional perspective posits that increasing the mechanical modulus of SPEs enhances their capacity to regulate Li0 deposition and suppress dendrite penetration. However, this study reveals a distinct failure mechanism: a rigid SPE with a high storage modulus suffers from delamination&#8208;induced cell failure due to its inability to accommodate the volumetric changes of the Li0 anode. To address these limitations, we developed a hierarchical SPE incorporating an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) positioned between the Li0 anode and the rigid SPE. The AAL combines strong adhesive strength, effectively mitigating delamination, with flowability, allowing it to eliminate interfacial voids and defects. Structural characterization via Cryo&#8208;TEM and SEM demonstrates that this hierarchical design facilitates uniform, dense, and whisker&#8208;free Li0 deposition, in sharp contrast to the uneven and porous morphology observed with the rigid SPE alone. Furthermore, the enhanced interfacial stability promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;enriched SEI layer, contributing to long&#8208;term cycling stability. As a result, the H&#8208;SPE exhibits superior electrochemical performance, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity over 960 cycles when paired with high&#8208;loading (1.6&#8197;mAh/cm2) NMC622 cathode.

         <title>Enabling Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation Prior to Water Reduction in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Mild Protic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and introduces mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) for aqueous zinc batteries according to thermodynamics. MMI is reduced prior to water, forming an organic&#8208;dominated SEI that effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition. Hence, zinc anodes exhibited exceptional reversibility and cycle stability in electrolyte with 20&#8197;mM MMI.







Abstract
Challenges like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite formation on zinc anodes hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), primarily due to the lack of an exceptional passivating solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). To effectively prevent water decomposition, it is essential to in situ construct SEI prior to water reduction. This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and predicts reduction potentials of mild protic compounds using thermodynamics. Based on this insight, mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) is introduced and found to be reduced prior to water at higher electrode potentials, as MMI exhibits slightly higher proton activity than water due to its thiol group. The reduction of MMI produces isothiocyanate species via a proposed electrocatalytic ring cleavage mechanism, which deposit on zinc anodes to form an SEI predominantly composed of organic compounds supplemented with Zn(OH)2. Benefiting from the unique advantage of preferential reduction before water, the MMI&#8208;derived SEI exhibits a superior passivating effect, as evidenced by a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in corrosion current of zinc anodes from 1170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 13.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The SEI effectively suppresses HER, and ensures dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, leading to high reversible zinc anodes with exceptional electrochemical performances.

&lt;p&gt;This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and introduces mild protic 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI) for aqueous zinc batteries according to thermodynamics. MMI is reduced prior to water, forming an organic-dominated SEI that effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and enables dendrite-free zinc deposition. Hence, zinc anodes exhibited exceptional reversibility and cycle stability in electrolyte with 20&#8197;mM MMI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite formation on zinc anodes hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), primarily due to the lack of an exceptional passivating solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). To effectively prevent water decomposition, it is essential to in situ construct SEI prior to water reduction. This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and predicts reduction potentials of mild protic compounds using thermodynamics. Based on this insight, mild protic 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI) is introduced and found to be reduced prior to water at higher electrode potentials, as MMI exhibits slightly higher proton activity than water due to its thiol group. The reduction of MMI produces isothiocyanate species via a proposed electrocatalytic ring cleavage mechanism, which deposit on zinc anodes to form an SEI predominantly composed of organic compounds supplemented with Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Benefiting from the unique advantage of preferential reduction before water, the MMI-derived SEI exhibits a superior passivating effect, as evidenced by a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in corrosion current of zinc anodes from 1170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 13.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The SEI effectively suppresses HER, and ensures dendrite-free zinc deposition, leading to high reversible zinc anodes with exceptional electrochemical performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of Peapod&#8208;Like Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Periodic Sequence via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Morphology Differentiation and Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel strategy for constructing peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence through fusion of vesicles and porous spheres. The generation and assembly of vesicles and porous spheres are achieved via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in one&#8208;pot. The aggregation unit numbers of peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers are affected by the length of solvophobic block and collision probability of vesicles and porous spheres.







Abstract
Inorganic nanoparticles have so far dominated the field of nanoparticle assembly, and assembly of pure organic nanoparticles (such as block copolymer nanoparticles) has rarely been examined in colloidal systems. Expanding the scope of nanoparticles is of great significance for the study of nanoparticle assembly. Herein, a paradigm for the copolymerization of organic nanoparticles into peapod&#8208;like linear nanostructures with periodic sequence is introduced. Vesicles and porous spheres are generated in situ during polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and can be viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;). The subsequent copolymerization of these nanomers is completed in one&#8208;pot, which greatly simplifies the preparation of nanomers and peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers. It is demonstrated that appropriate &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are crucial to the formation of nanomers and their copolymerization progress. Notably, the research subjects in nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence have expanded to organic nanoparticles, which is beneficial to further expand the horizons of nanoparticle assembly. Moreover, the multiple separated compartments in the peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers will open new directions toward development of artificial organelle and on&#8208;demand catalysis in different compartments within the same nano&#8208;object.

         <title>Chemocatalytic Cell Tagging Platform for Recording Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions via Engineered Palladium&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative chemocatalytic proximity labeling platform&#8208;Artificial Metalloenzyme Tagging Technology (ArM&#8208;Tag). The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a protein scaffold to catalyze a bioorthogonal O&#8208;deallylation reaction directly on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range.







Abstract
Proximity labeling platforms (PLPs) have become a powerful tool for studying spatial cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs) in living organisms. However, their effectiveness often relies on membranal catalytic modules of bait cells, such as natural enzymes or small&#8208;molecule photocatalysts, which are typically constrained by complex genetic modifications or the limited applicability of visible light. Here, we present a novel chemocatalytic approach, ArM&#8208;Tag, which utilizes an engineered artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) for cell surface&#8208;localized tagging. The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a streptavidin (SAV) scaffold to catalyze the O&#8208;deallylation reaction on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range. By integrating Biotin&#8208;SAV technology with directed evolution, we engineered a series of biotinylated Pd complexes and optimized the ArM for efficient catalysis. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying the ArM&#8208;Tag system to selectively record antigen&#8208;specific CCIs, specifically showing how CAR&#8722;T cells interact with tumor cells through the mesothelin/anti&#8208;mesothelin axis. This versatile, non&#8208;genetic system provides a powerful tool for probing CCIs and offers exciting prospects for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in targeted cancer treatments and immune cell&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann Water Catalyzed Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the catalytic role of water molecule and the inherent thermal radiation in gaseous homogeneous high&#8208;temperatue propane dehydrogenation, in which the water molecule could generate hydroxyl radicals with the help of thermal radiation and thus facilitate the reaction. Consequently, the proposed system could achieve a 37.93&#8201;% olefin yield and a 51.14&#8201;% single&#8208;pass propane conversion, and an excellent stability for over 2,000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The traditional wisdom of utilizing water in practical olefin synthesis has been viewed as a means to reduce alkane partial pressure and assist in coke removal. However, under such harsh reaction conditions, the potential catalytic role of the water molecule remains unclear. This study explores the intriguing concept that the water molecule, through the selective excitation of molecular vibrations and collisions induced by thermal energy and thermal radiation, could act as a catalyst in homogeneous gaseous propane dehydrogenation. This occurs via the generation of the OH&#8901; radicals, resulting in an olefin yield of 37.93&#8201;%, a single pass propane conversion of 51.14&#8201;%, and an excellent stability of more than 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven CuAAC Reaction Catalyzed by Photosensitive Biohybrids Energized by Lactate for Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system has been presented for boosting cancer immunotherapy. Powered by lactate, the biohybrid can trigger the CuAAC reaction to generate active drugs in situ through bacterial respiration. Of note, under illumination, the CuAAC reaction can be further accelerated.







Abstract
As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper (I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strongly depends on the reducing agents and the rate of the CuAAC reaction is far from sufficient to produce drug agents under physiological conditions. It is necessary and highly demanding to develop an efficient CuAAC reaction without using chemical reducing agents. Herein, inspired by the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria within the realm of synthetic biology, a photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system for boosting cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The bacteria specifically anaerobically catabolize lactate at the tumor site, accompanied by transferring electrons to the bioorthogonal catalyst, thereby triggering the CuAAC reaction to produce active drugs in situ. Strikingly, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by attached AuNPs can be transported into bacterial cytoplasm to accelerate the CuAAC reaction by promoting cellular metabolism. The biohybrid enables synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and alleviation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Ingeniously, ICD and lactate consumption both boost the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. Overall, the system provides a bridge between the tumor metabolism and CuAAC reaction through bacterial respiration, offering fascinating opportunities for controlled synthesis of active molecules by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Achieving Free&#8208;Electron Transfer Reversal and dz2&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Modulation on Core&#8208;shell NiS@Au Cocatalysts for Highly Selective H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

The NiS&#8208;induced free&#8208;electron reversal migration discharges dz2&#8208;orbital electrons of Au cocatalysts to reduce the antibonding occupancy of Au&#948;+&#8208;Oad bonds, thus improving O2 adsorption and stabilizing *OOH intermediates on NiS@Au cocatalysts to achieve highly selective H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
Spontaneous free&#8208;electron migration usually occurs on the interface between host photocatalysts and cocatalysts, but the influences of the charge transfer direction on the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) of cocatalysts have not been taken seriously. Herein, an innovative electron&#8208;transfer reversal is proposed to direct the free&#8208;electron transfer in a way that enables highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR on Au cocatalysts. To this end, metallic Au nanoparticles are originally loaded on NiS particles to fabricate novel core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 surface by a directional photodeposition procedure. XAS spectra and DFT calculations disclose that the intergrated NiS induces a reversed free&#8208;electron transfer from Au nanoparticles to NiS core, thus essentially modulating dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy of Au atoms to enhance O2 adsorption and stabilize key *OOH intermediates, endowing core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts with a highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR process for efficient H2O2 evolution. Consequently, the optimized g&#8208;C3N4/NiS@Au photocatalyst achieves a remarkably promoted H2O2&#8208;production rate of 264.82&#8197;&#956;mol/h/50&#8197;mg in the air environment, possessing a high apparent quantum efficiency of 8.07&#8201;% under visible light. This work provides novel insights on purposefully steering free&#8208;electron transfer direction to engineer dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy, offering a feasible approach for designing highly active photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Evolution&#8208;Guided Discovery of Antimycobacterial Triculamin&#8208;Like Lasso Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hypothesized convergent biosynthesis of triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from different biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) types represented across multiple bacterial phyla. The elucidation of the triculamin non&#8208;canonical BGC and resistance mechanism by heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus and in&#8197;vitro acetylation with resistance conveying enzyme. Discovery and characterization of two triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from canonical lasso peptide BGCs.







Abstract
Triculamin is a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) lasso peptide with potent antimycobacterial activity, produced by an unusual, non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and N&#8208;acetyltransferase (triT). Through in&#8197;vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin&#8208;like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non&#8208;canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin&#8208;like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin&#8208;like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross&#8208;phylum distribution.

Quenching xenon's thirst by its coordination to water in the 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 complexes, [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, provides the first examples of Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O bonded noble&#8208;gas hydrates. These complexes, along with (CH2CH2O)4XeO3, were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and computational studies that show the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts with the crown ethers and water molecules are &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.







Abstract
Following on our report of the first coordination complex between a noble&#8208;gas compound and a crown ether, (CH2CH2O)5XeO3, the reactions and structures of XeO3 complexes with 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 were investigated. The reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with XeO3 in dilute aqueous HF solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, whereas reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with moist solid XeO3 in acetone solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O complexes are air&#8208;stable and shock&#8208;insensitive, whereas [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF is a treacherous, shock&#8208;sensitive detonator. Low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that XeO3 is coordinated to the crown ether and H2O through short Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts. Mappings of the XeO3 Hirshfeld surfaces onto 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O reveal regions of negative electrostatic potential (EP) on the oxygen atoms of the crown ethers and regions of high positive EP on the Xe(VI) atom of XeO3 that are consistent with &#963;&#8208;hole bonds. The calculated gas&#8208;phase geometries, Wiberg bond valences and indices, and empirical bond valences corroborate the descriptions of the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;

         <title>Highly Strained Electron&#8208;Rich Molecular Bowl and Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowls is essential due to their potential complementary properties to molecules such as corannulene and sumanene. However, their development is challenging because of the inherent high strain. Herein, the small electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1 (C20N2H8) and the wavy dimer 2 have been synthesized, and their optical, electronic, and supramolecular properties are extensively studied.







Abstract
Introducing two pyrrole rings at the armchair edges of perylene creates the small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1, which can be viewed as a nitrogen&#8208;doped end&#8208;cap of C70. Despite numerous attempts since 2008, its synthesis has been hindered by strain and synthetic challenges. In this study, we present the synthesis and property analysis of molecular bowl 1 and its dimer, the wavy&#8208;shaped nanographene 2. Substituents on nitrogen atoms significantly affect the bowl depth, intermolecular interactions, and supramolecular behaviors. Consequently, the butyl&#8208;substituted molecular bowl 1&#8201;a forms unusual polar crystals with all bowls oriented similarly, suggesting potential pyroelectric or ferroelectric applications. Due to the electron&#8208;rich nature, compounds 1 exhibit significantly strong binding affinity towards fullerene, with 1&#8201;a forming a sandwich structure with C70. Furthermore, neutral bowls 1 display counter&#8208;rotating ring currents similar to corannulene, while their dications exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The wavy&#8208;structured nanographene 2 demonstrates two continuously reversible oxidation processes, and its dication 22+ shows remarkably high stability under ambient conditions. In summary, this work constructs a small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl and its nanographene dimer, highlighting their exceptional properties, promising applications, and potential as foundations for future advanced nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Constructing Dense Morphology of Sn with High Reversibility under High Areal&#8208;capacity for Anode&#8208;Free Tin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiourea (TU) was proposed as an effective additive to constructing dense morphology of deposited Sn in acidic methylsulfonate&#8208;based electrolyte. By participating in double electrode layer, TU reduces exchange current density of Sn2+/Sn redox, suppresses rampant two&#8208;dimension, and makes Sn anode exert high coulombic efficiency of 99.85% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free Sn battery was developed.







Abstract
Sn electrode possesses high reversibility, redox kinetics and corrosion resistance, as well as non&#8208;toxic and environmental compatibility, which is competitive candidate for aqueous batteries. However, due to huge size of deposition particles and &#8220;dead Sn&#8221;, it is a great challenge to obtain high areal&#8208;capacity (&gt;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible Sn redox electrochemistry with high areal&#8208;capacity enabled by thiourea additive. Systematical investigations reveal the participation of thiourea molecules in the electrical double layer, reducing exchange current density and suppressing rampant two&#8208;dimensional diffusion. As a result, flat and dense scale&#8208;like deposition Sn morphology is obtained, which enables high cycle stability with high areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for symmetrical cell with lean electrolyte (25&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and delivering a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;% with practical high 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 area&#8208;capacity for asymmetrical cell. More importantly, anode&#8208;free Organic||Sn battery is developed, and 62&#8201;% capacity retention can be obtained after 570 cycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Triple&#8208;Atom Sites Combined with Oxygen Vacancy for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Propionic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a defect engineering strategy to create asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs), which achieves high propionic acid synthesis rates and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the key roles of OVs and triple&#8208;atom sites. Such OVs&#8208;engineered asymmetric catalytic sites efficiently promote the multistep C&#8722;C coupling process.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon products is an emerging approach for achieving carbon neutrality; however, the design of active sites that effectively promote multistep C&#8722;C coupling remains a challenge. Here, we propose a straightforward defect engineering approach to construct asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (named CWO&#8208;OVs). The optimized CWO&#8208;OVs achieve a photochemical synthesis rate of propionic acid (C3H6O2, PA) of 86.46&#177;2.92&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with an electron&#8208;based selectivity of 89.27&#8201;%, which exhibits a remarkable advantage in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations corroborate the prominent role of OVs in inducing the triple&#8208;atom sites: (1) the asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+ triggers the first step of C1&#8208;C1 coupling to form *CH2CH3; (2) Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+ facilitates subsequent C2&#8208;C1 bonding, ultimately leading to PA production. This charge&#8208;asymmetric cascade reaction system offers new insights into the design of efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon products.

         <title>Anion Adsorption at the Inner&#8208;Helmholtz Plane Directs Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of anion adsorption at the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane in directing CEI formation was investigated using multiple in situ/operando techniques. QCM&#8722;D directly observes its influence on interfacial structure, while in situ spectroscopy and EQCM&#8722;D confirm its impact on CEI chemistry. The anion&#8208;driven interphase leads to a more inorganic&#8208;rich CEI, suppressing electrolyte decomposition and enhancing LiCoO2 cycling stability at high voltages.







Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (CEI) on cathode surface constitutes the foundation of realizing high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet its formation, a highly heterogeneous process involving irreversible reactions between electrolyte components and cathode materials, remains poorly understood. Herein, combining multiple in situ/operando interfacial characterization techniques, we establish the correlation between interfacial structure and interphasial chemistry, and reveal the key role played by adsorptive behavior of various electrolyte components in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane during CEI formation. Quartz crystal microbalance equipped with dissipation modification detects that difluorooxalatoborate (DFOB&#8722;) anion preferentially adsorbed on LiCoO2 tends to expel carbonate solvents from the adsorption layer, thus suppressing their electrochemical decomposition at high voltages and leading to a more compact CEI derived from anions with limited contribution from organic ingredients. Consequently, the CoO2 lattice structure protected by the dense CEI remains intact despite near&#8208;complete delithiation, thereby ensuring excellent cycling stability for 4.7&#8197;V operation of LiCoO2 cathode. The atomistic&#8208;level insight into the key factors that govern CEI formation provides directive knowledge that accelerates electrolyte design for high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Nanourchin&#8208;like Uricase&#8208;Poly(L&#8208;proline) Conjugate with Retained Enzymatic Activity, Mitigated Immunogenicity, and Sustained Efficacy Upon Repeated Administrations</title>

Poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugated uricase was facilely produced via a grafting&#8208;from approach, which showed mitigated immunogenicity and preserved activity in vivo after repeated injections.







Abstract
The poor half&#8208;life and strong immunogenicity of proteins such as uricase (UOx), a therapeutic enzyme for chronic refractory gout and hyperuricemia, are pressing clinical challenges. Although conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGylation) of UOx can improve the pharmacokinetics, preexisting or induced anti&#8208;PEG antibodies, which lead to accelerate blood clearance (ABC) and reduced response rate, have been a major clinical hurdle. Herein, we report the facile &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; preparation of a nanourchin&#8208;like uricase&#8208;poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugate, namely UOx&#8208;PLP, with high grafting&#8208;density, enhanced thermal, lyophilization, freeze&#8208;thaw, and proteolytic stability. Through a transient preblocking strategy in the synthesis, the UOx&#8208;PLP overcomes activity loss and retains ~82&#8201;% enzyme activity. In Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats, UOx&#8208;PLP stimulates minimum complement activation and anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Unlike PEG&#8208;UOx gave a significantly reduced half&#8208;life after repetitive administrations, UOx&#8208;PLP shows no sign of ABC effect. Moreover, the half&#8208;life of UOx&#8208;PLP remain almost unchanged when cross&#8208;administrated to rats previously received PEG&#8208;UOx and with high titers of anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Finally, UOx&#8208;PLP shows minimum loss of efficacy after five straight administrations in a UOx knock&#8208;out hyperuricemia mice model, whereas PEG&#8208;UOx experiences sharp loss of efficacy upon the same treatment. Overall, the simple preparation and outstanding nonclinical results highlight the enormous potential of UOx&#8208;PLP for future clinical translation.

         <title>Nanofabrication via SEM Electron&#8208;Beam Stimulated Suzuki&#8211;Miyura Type Reaction: Fingerprints of Carbazole Derivative Revealed by Synchrotron&#8208;IR Nanospectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>

This study investigates the conditions under which 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole can be formed in solid state by using a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction triggered by electron beam irradiation. Synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and mass spectrometry revealed signatures of the target product, suggesting a potential palladium&#8208;free reaction pathway and offering a direct route to the fabrication of nanodevices.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based compounds have demonstrated interesting physical and chemical properties for OLED devices. 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole has a direct application in the composition of structures with potential to suppress the loss of efficiency under high luminance conditions along with its use in the emitting layer. In this study, we reveal and explore the conditions in which a triggered electron beams (e&#8208;beams) solid state Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction between 3,6&#8208;diiodocarbazole and phenylboronic acid could be carried out. Applying typical SEM acceleration voltage (30&#8197;keV), sufficient energy transfer enabled the activation of the reaction. Synchrotron Infrared Nano Spectroscopy (SINS) was used to acquire nanoscale molecular vibrational spectra and compare with conventional FTIR absorption spectra for chemical characterization. Evidences obtained by mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole under higher e&#8208;beam dose (30&#8197;keV, 10&#8197;minutes), when compared to 5 and 10&#8197;keV. In addition, the phenylboronic acid seems to have a role in the reaction outcome. Both samples irradiated in the presence and in the absence of palladium exhibited the fingerprints of the expected product 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole shedding light on possible alternative mechanisms and the straightforward construction of nanodevices.

         <title>Crystallization Modulation and Comprehensive Defect Passivation by Carbonyl Functionalized Spacer Cation Towards High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation strategy was proposed of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. By this synergetic strategy, improved crystallization, reduced defect density, released residual stress and minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses were accomplished simultaneously. The inverted devices delivered a champion PCE of 25.77&#8201;%.







Abstract
The inverted cesium/formamidinium (CsFA)&#8208;based methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells possess great potential in simultaneously realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent stability. However, the uncontrollable crystallization process and poor film quality hinder further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Herein, we propose a synergistic modulation strategy of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. L&#8208;Alanine benzyl ester hydrochloride (L&#8208;ABEHCl) containing carbonyl functionalized ammonium cation is incorporated into perovskite precursor solution, increasing the nucleation rate and reducing the crystal growth rate because of its strong interaction with precursor components, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. No 2D perovskite is formed for L&#8208;ABEHCl as additive whereas 2D perovskite is formed upon L&#8208;ABEHCl post&#8208;treatment. It is revealed that FA+ and Cs+ in precursor solution suppress the formation of 2D perovskite. As a result, the L&#8208;ABEHCl passivates the defects at GBs in the form of organic salts and passivates interface defects in the form of 2D perovskite. Due to minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses, the inverted devices using synergistic modulation strategy achieve a maximum PCE of 25.77&#8201;% (certified stabilized PCE of 25.59&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation method. The unencapsulated target device maintains 90.85&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 2300&#8197;h of continuous maximum power point tracking, among the most excellent stabilities accomplished by inverted devices.

         <title>Exploiting Bis&#8208;Sulfonimide Featuring Multiple d&#8211;p&#960; Bonds to Construct Interlayers for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), distinguished by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently introduced as an adaptable electron&#8208;withdrawing motif to construct interlayer materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). The unique conformational and electronic structure of BSI imparts excellent thickness tolerance and universal applicability to the interlayer materials, leading to 19.80&#8201;% efficiency OSCs with good operational stability.







Abstract
Herein, bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), characterized by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently utilized as a general and extendable building block to develop a series of multifunctional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). An illustrative CIM, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI, demonstrates favorable alcohol processability, superior work function tunability, appropriate energy levels, strong self&#8208;doping effect, and decent crystallinity. These attributes contribute to its high conductivity exceeding 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm, as well as precise optimization of the interfacial connection between the active layer and metal cathode. Therefore, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI&#8208;based OSCs delivers an outstanding efficiency of 18.08&#8201;% using PM6:Y6 active layer while retaining 84&#8201;% of its initial performance after tracking at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1100&#8197;hours. Additionally, the devices maintain over 94&#8201;% of the optimal performance across a film thickness range of BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI from 5 to 90&#8197;nm. Moreover, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI exhibits high compatibility with various active layers, enabling a record efficiency of 19.80&#8201;% with the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO active layer. This work not only introduces a new library of water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type semiconductors containing BSI, while also pioneers the creation of thickness&#8208;insensitive CIMs for stable and efficient OSCs by integrating electron&#8208;withdrawing components with d&#8208;p&#960; bonds.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Lamellar Conductive Heterochannels with Optical&#8208;Electrical Coupling Sensitivity for Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing PyGO conductive heterochannel with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity were fabricated through super&#8208;assembly strategy for smart ion transport. Benefiting from the coupling conductivity and photosensitivity of the PPy conductive network, the output power density of salinity gradient energy device with this lamellar photoelectric membrane could achieve 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under illumination.







Abstract
Artificial nanofluidic devices inspired bylight&#8208;driven ion transport in biological systems, leveraging the photoelectric effect, have attracted extensive attention for their potential in signal transduction and smart ion transport applications. However, effective separation of photogenerated carriers in traditional p&#8208;n junction interface can be hindered by energy band structure of different semiconductor materials. Here, we present a novel approach using conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to modify graphene oxide (GO), creating polypyrrole&#8208;graphene oxide (PyGO) functional lamellar conductive nanochannels with tailored channel&#8208;sized gradients and inherent optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity via a facile super&#8208;assembly strategy. This design facilitates the PyGO own conductive lamellar channels and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly enhanced selective ion transport behavior. Coupling the conductivity and photosensitivity of PPy contributes to a peak power density of 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under a salinity differential of 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl, which is 35.6&#8201;% higher than that under dark conditions. Additionally, combing the salinity gradients with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity of the nanofludic devices, we demonstrate the application of PyGO in a real&#8208;time detection device for monitoring ion concentrations in nutrient solutions, paving the way for smart irrigation systems in agriculture. This work presents a novel and effective strategy for light&#8208;driven ion transport with potential applications in energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes by Interfacial Engineering of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) disrupt the hydrogen bond network through the surface amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands, activate the interfacial water, and enrich the alkyne molecules. In addition, their unique enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets adsorb alkyne molecules through the &#963;&#8208;bonding mode, allowing the timely desorption of alkene, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Owing to its green energy and hydrogen sources, electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes is an attractive alternative for industrial alkene production. However, its broad application is hindered by low selectivity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to side reactions like over&#8208;hydrogenation to alkanes. Here, we demonstrate that atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) can electrocatalyze alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with 98&#8201;% conversion, 99&#8201;% selectivity, and 85&#8201;% FE, in a broad substrate pool. This is achieved by engineering the local environment at the catalytically active sites. We leverage amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands to pre&#8208;concentrate water molecules and alkynes near the ligand&#8208;layer/Ag25 interface. Long&#8208;chain ligands can disrupt the hydrogen&#8208;bond network at the interface, the high negative charge of Ag25 can attract weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water through counterions and promote the generation of active hydrogen (H*), while the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets on the surface of Ag25 NCs facilitate adsorption of terminal alkynes via &#963;&#8208;bonding to the surface Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the preference of the &#963;&#8208;bonding model of alkyne and further revealed the facile release of product alkene. This work not only exemplifies an atomically precise interface engineering strategy to control the local environment of active sites for optimized activity and selectivity.

         <title>Twist and Shine: Ultra&#8208;Narrow Red Emission from Nitrogen and Oxygen Co&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen are synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy. These molecules feature a bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene core, with benzopyran rings fused at the periphery to enhance the rigidity of &#960;&#8208;framework. This unique design enables ultra&#8208;narrow red emission, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Nanographenes, known for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have garnered significant interest for their tunable electronic structures, particularly through heteroatom doping. Herein, we report the synthesis of two twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes (h&#8208;NGs) co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen via a three&#8208;step strategy, where the tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization and ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution serve as a key step. Both h&#8208;NGs incorporate a unique bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene (BFDAC) core, with one further extending the &#960;&#8208;system via peri&#8208;fusion of four benzopyran units. Single&#8208;crystal analyses reveal that BFDAC core of both h&#8208;NGs adopts a highly twisted geometry, whereas the benzopyran&#8208;fused one has enhanced rigidity. Theoretical studies confirm a global aromaticity with 30 &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized along BFDAC periphery. Notably, co&#8208;doping enables precise electronic tuning, with pyridinic nitrogen lowering the LUMO level and benzopyran oxygen raising the HOMO level. Both h&#8208;NGs display the red photoluminescence (PL), and the benzopyran&#8208;fused derivative exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm, among the narrowest reported for organic red&#8208;emitting materials. Both h&#8208;NGs exhibit acid&#8208;responsive optical behavior including near&#8208;infrared absorption shift and PL quenching, providing additional functional versatility.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Uric Acid Oxidation via Interdistance&#8208;Dependent Switching Pathways in Correlated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Boosting Sensing Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlated ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Ru c&#8208;SACs) with tailored single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) of 9.3&#8197;&#197;, 7.0&#8197;&#197;, and 6.2&#8197;&#197; were prepared via organometallic design. The Ru c&#8208;SAC with 6.2&#8197;&#197; SAD exhibited superior uric acid electrooxidation activity due to the optimal inter&#8208;atomic distance facilitating a three&#8208;electron transfer pathway, substantiated by comprehensive experimental studies and theoretical computations, and unveiling atomic&#8208;level SAD&#8208;activity relationships in single&#8208;atom electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The overly simplistic geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a significant bottleneck in the field of single&#8208;atom sensing, impeding both the design of highly efficient electrochemical sensors and the establishment of structure&#8211;activity relationships. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy to boost the sensing performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by precisely tuning the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs). A series of Ru&#8208;based c&#8208;SACs (Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197;, Rud=7.0&#8201;&#197;, and Rud=9.3&#8201;&#197;) are synthesized with predetermined SAD values, which are comprehensively characterized by various techniques. Electrochemical studies on uric acid (UA) oxidation reveal that Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197; demonstrates an extraordinary sensitivity of 9.83&#8197;&#956;A &#956;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;2, which is superior to most of electrochemistry biosensors reported previously. Kinetic analysis and product examination unveil that the 6.2&#8197;&#197; Ru SAD instigates a distinctive three&#8208;electron oxidation of UA, with an extra electron transfer compared to the conventional two&#8208;electron pathway, which fundamentally enhances its sensitivity. Density functional theory calculations confirm the optimal SAD facilitates dual&#8208;site UA adsorption and accelerated charge transfer dynamics. This investigation provides novel insights into the strategic engineering of high&#8208;performance SAC&#8208;based electrochemical sensors by precisely controlling the atomic&#8208;scale structure of active sites.

         <title>Nucleation Engineering to Strengthen Interface Contacts in Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the nucleation barrier at the substrate surface, the nucleation process is prone to occur at the substrate, resulting in intimate interface contact, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed interface nonradiative recombination. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with improved thermal stability is achieved, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on single crystals hold potential for higher efficiency and stability, while the incomplete interface contact hinders hole carrier extraction and device performance. Herein, we report strengthening crystal/substrate contact by nucleation engineering based on in situ growth strategy. Through modulating the hole transport layer (HTL) to induce the nucleation process at substrate surface, interface residual solution, voids, and small&#8208;sized crystals are eliminated, thus ensuring intimate interface contact physically. Combining with strong interaction between perovskites and HTL, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed nonradiative recombination are achieved. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8&#8201;% is obtained, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Moreover, the thermal&#8208;induced peeling&#8208;off of crystals from substrates is mitigated, which improves the device thermal stability distinctly.

         <title>Sequence Similarity Network Guided Discovery of a Dehydrogenase for Asymmetric Carbonyl Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive sequence similarity network based approach enabled the identification of a diverse array of uncharacterized enzymes from nature, leading to the discovery of several novel asymmetric carbonyl desaturation enzymes. Among them, the most outstanding enzyme, TgDH, demonstrated remarkable stereoselectivity and reactivity, catalyzing the synthesis of various chiral cyclohexenones bearing &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters with high efficiency.







Abstract
Carbonyl dehydrogenation is one of the most valuable transformations in modern synthetic chemistry. As compared to traditional chemical synthesis methods, enzymatic dehydrogenation offers a greener and more selective alternative. However, except for a few rare natural dehydrogenases for desaturation, current enzymatic methods predominantly rely on enzyme promiscuity, which often suffers from lower efficiency and limited reaction controllability. Herein, we employed sequence similarity networks to mine natural dehydrogenases from a vast array of sequences with potential dehydrogenation activity. This approach led to the discovery of an uncharacterized FAD&#8208;dependent enzyme capable of efficiently performing the desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones, thereby generating diverse cyclohexenones bearing remote &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. The current method has enhanced the turnover frequency (TOF) by approximately 178&#8208;fold as compared to the best existing biocatalytic strategies and displayed almost no overoxidation reactions. Through a combination of experimental assays and computational studies, we elucidated that this enzyme enhances its dehydrogenation capability through an unconventional proton relay system, absent in previously reported enzyme promiscuity systems. Additionally, this streamlined enzymatic process demonstrated scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis with maintained efficiency and selectivity, offering robust and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of chiral cyclohexenones with high optical purity.

         <title>Manipulating Crystal Packing in Heterocycloarenes by an Atom Engineering Strategy for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains in single&#8208;crystal form enable chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes to be systematically investigated for the first time. Notably, NS achieves a record&#8208;high mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), which enlarges the family of emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSCs with high mobility for practical applications.







Abstract
Developing (hetero)cycloarenes, an emerging class of ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications remains significantly constrained due to their synthetic challenge and limited diversity of available materials. Herein, a series of coplanar chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains were synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form, and chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes was investigated in detailed. Sulfur&#8208;fused NS exhibits a closest herringbone crystal packing with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance as low as 3.11&#8197;&#197;, resulting in a record&#8208;high hole mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped OSCs. Remarkably, selenium&#8208;fused NSe without intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in its crystalline state, also manifests the second highest mobility of up to 2.11&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is attributed to the presence of extensive short&#8208;range edge&#8208;to&#8208;face Se&#8230;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions. Furthermore, these heterocycloarenes exhibit a selective supramolecular interaction with C70, with the trend in binding constants being: NS &lt; NO &lt; NSe. Overall, this work not only systematically elucidates the role of atom engineering on heterocycloarenes for the first time, but also paves the way for practical applications of the emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSC materials.

         <title>Volatile Imide Additives with Large Dipole and Special Film Formation Kinetics Enable High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three volatile imide additives with large dipole moments which improved the performance of the OSCs device by manipulating the crystallization process of the acceptor were reported. These additives could induce the acceptor to first nucleate and then grow, forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains and improving charge transport. One of the highest power conversion efficiencies of 19.04% was achieved for D18:L8&#8208;BO devices treated with pClPA.







Abstract
Large dipole moment additives have strong interactions with the host materials, which can optimize morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these additives are difficult to remove due to their strong intermolecular interactions, which may impair stability. Developing volatile additives with large dipole moments is challenging. Herein, we first report volatile imide additives that could effectively improve the performance of OSCs through morphology modification. Three additives N&#8208;(o&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (oClPA), N&#8208;(m&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (mClPA), and N&#8208;(p&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (pClPA) were screened to investigate the effort of positional isomerization on molecular configuration and interaction. These additives (ClPAs) have larger dipole moments (2.0664 Debye for oClPA, 4.2361 Debye for mClPA, and 4.7896 Debye for pClPA) compared to reported solid additives. In contrast to traditional simultaneous nucleation and crystal growth, ClPAs could induce the acceptor to nucleate first and then grow, which contributes to forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains with better crystallinity. To our knowledge, this unique film formation kinetics was reported first. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 treated with pClPA was improved from 16.13&#8201;% to 18.58&#8201;%. Additive pClPA also performed well in PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:Y6, and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, and a high PCE of 19.04&#8201;% was achieved. Our results indicate using imide unit to construct solid additives is a simple and effective strategy, and the positional isomerization of halogen atom also has a large effect on the photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Superhelical Self&#8208;Assembly of Microcrystals from Cyclodipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclodipeptide platform delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures. It undergoes complicated pathway including the hierarchical organization of molecular blocks in a spontaneous and ordered manner. Here we present a cyclodipeptide platform which delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. Homochiral linear dipeptides bearing tyrosine and phenylglycine residue go through cyclization to afford cyclodipeptides, leading to the in situ reaction&#8208;induced aggregation into giant helices with ultra&#8208;high yields and phase purity. The pathway comprises formation of subunit microcrystals and the subsequent assembly through adhesion of favorable planes. The cyclodipeptide adopts a folded geometry that generates 2D hydrogen bonded networks differing from the typical 1D duplex hydrogen bonding of diketopiperazines skeletons. The assembly of subunit crystals driven by the hydrogen bonding undergoes dislocations mediated by the inherent chirality of cyclodipeptides. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Blue&#8208;Emitting Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or v&#8208;DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.







Abstract
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). High&#8208;performance blue OLEDs still pose a considerable challenge. Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronic technologies. In this study, we designed a series of original high&#8208;triplet PHC materials based on a multi&#8208;substitution approach of the 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (SBF) backbone and used them, for the first time, as a host in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs. Devices based on the 2,6&#8208;bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR&#8208;TADF OLED devices based on v&#8208;DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQEmax of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Closed Four&#8208;Link Chains and Borromean Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (841links) and Borromean links (632 links) have been successfully synthesized in one&#8208;step processes. The interlocked molecules were generated by the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions of bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole ligands and binuclear Cp*Rh/Ir&#8208;based precursors.







Abstract
Despite substantial advancements in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), the efficient construction of higher order links remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the highly efficient one&#8208;step directed construction of a series of unprecedented molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (84 1 metalla&#8208;links), achieved through the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions involving binuclear rhodium/iridium precursors and bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligands. Meanwhile, modulating the substituent positions of the pyridine groups in the ligand resulted in a change in topological structure, leading to the formation of two molecular Borromean links (

metalla&#8208;links). The molecular configurations of the abovementioned metalla&#8208;links were clearly identified through mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, structural transformation between the molecular Borromean links and corresponding monocycles was achieved through concentration effects, as validated by solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy investigations.

         <title>Luminescent Alkylaluminium Anthranilates Reaching Unity Quantum Yield in the Condensed Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrameric alkylaluminium anthranilates have been synthesised that&#160;exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent photoluminescence performance. In one of the complexes,&#160;intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions have been found to lead to a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Transition, post&#8208;transition and rare earth metal complexes supported by (O,N)&#8208; and (N,N)&#8208;type ligands dominate organometallic photochemistry. However, despite a vast number of aminobenzoate metal complexes having been reported, and aluminium being globally abundant, alkylaluminium anthranilates have not yet been considered as effective luminophores. Herein, using a family of commercially available ligands composed of anthranilic acid (anth&#8208;H2) and its N&#8208;substituted derivatives, we report the isolation and characterisation of a series of unique tetrameric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal alkylaluminium anthranilates, [(R'&#8208;anth)AlR]4. The resulting compounds are characterised using spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction to analyse structure&#8208;determining factors in the solid state and solution. Moreover, by changing the N&#8208;substituents from H to Me and Ph, we have yielded a series of luminophores that exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent performance, providing a [(Ph&#8208;anth)AlEt]4 derivative that achieves a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase, which is unprecedented for aluminium complexes.

         <title>A Trimming&#8208;&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trimming&#8208;&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino&#8208;metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.







Abstract
Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming&#8208;&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation&#8208;after&#8208;coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four&#8208;point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz&#8208;based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&#8722;2 to 1.3&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc&#8208;based MOF counterparts. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra&#8208;small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with built&#8208;in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity&#8208;dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH3 and NO2 using a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V.

         <title>Electrochemical Responsive Alginate Chains Rendered Sol&#8208;to&#8208;Gel Gradient Electrolyte towards Practical Ah&#8208;level Zinc Metal Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte was designed to break the trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity from aqueous electrolyte and the stable interface from hydrogel electrolyte, through the high ionic conductive bulk electrolyte and lean&#8208;water hydrogel&#8208;like state interface. This work paves a new way for electrolyte design towards pratical zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Zinc metal batteries have been considered as an appealing candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage devices, but are hindered by the instable interface. Herein, we design a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte through the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Zn2+ and alginate. The electrochemical gelation of alginate creates a gradient sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel interface and enables the high ionic conductivity, where vehicular mechanism dominated transport is maintained in the bulk electrolyte, while a lean&#8208;water hydrogel like state is created at the Zn/electrolyte interface to reduce water activity. The electrochemical active alginate undergoes a gelation process to form an egg&#8208;shell to confine the Zn2+, rendering a 2D growth mode and inhibiting dendrite growth. By taking the advantages of both fast ion transport and stable interface, the full cell based on Zn/VO2 achieved a stable cycling of 400 cycles at an industrial&#8208;level areal capacity of over 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity retention of 89.25&#8201;%. Additionally, we demonstrate the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell, which stably operates for over 200 cycles with an almost unity average coulombic efficiency (over 99.90&#8201;%). By demonstrating the remarkable performance, our work represents an advancement in zinc metal batteries toward a practical scale and is expected to set a stepping stone for transformative advancements in energy storage technologies.

         <title>A Druglike Ferrostatin&#8208;1 Analogue as a Ferroptosis Inhibitor and Photoluminescent Indicator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole as a bio&#8208;isostere of the ester group in Fer&#8208;1 not only provides druglike Ferfluor&#8208;1 with high potency and favorable blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability for a significant anti&#8208;ferroptosis effect in vivo, but also creates a unique ratiometric photoluminescent probe sensitive to the fluctuation of ferroptosis by an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) mechanism.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic applications have long suffered from a shortage of suitable drugs and probes of high specificity. In the context of anti&#8208;ferroptosis research for neurological diseases, the inaccessibility of a blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeable small molecular ferroptosis inhibitor, and the lack of specific ferroptosis probes, seriously impeded a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis and the development of clinically applicable drugs. We report herein a novel 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole&#8208;functionalized druglike ferrostatin analogue entitled Ferfluor&#8208;1 with superior anti&#8208;ferroptosis potency, favorable BBB permeability and in vivo activity against stroke and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the exclusive pseudo&#8208;excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) property of Ferfluor&#8208;1 via a long&#8208;distance hydrogen&#8208;bonding network makes it the first sensitive ratiometric photoluminescent probe to detect phospholipid hydroperoxides and a specific indicator for the fluctuation of ferroptosis. These unprecedented advantages not only make Ferfluor&#8208;1 a potential tool for ferroptosis&#8208;related diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the central nervous system, but also pave the way to developing new theragnostic agents for precision redox detection and regulation.

         <title>Dynamic Short Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network Enhancing Hydrophilicity in Biomimetic Membranes with Artificial Water Channels for Efficient Removal of Dyes and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated biomimetic membrane combining I&#8208;quartet water channels and sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide achieves simultaneous dye and salt rejection with high water permeance. Leveraging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, this design enhances antifouling performance and provides an energy&#8208;efficient solution for textile wastewater treatment.







Abstract
The development of an integrated biomimetic membrane capable of rejecting both dyes and salts in a single step, while sustaining stable water permeation, presents a promising solution for textile wastewater treatment. Herein, we report a novel integrated biomimetic membrane integrating an I&#8208;quartet artificial water channel (AWC) with sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide (PA&#8208;SO3H), which can stably reject both dyes and inorganic salts. The I&#8208;quartet channels (2.68&#8197;&#197;), formed via self&#8208;assembly of alkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole (HC8) molecules, facilitate selective water transport and rejection of both dyes and inorganic salts. Concurrently, the sulfonic acid groups (&#8722;SO3H) could grab water molecules, forming dynamic short hydrogen&#8208;bonding network (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O). These hydrogen bonds not only serve as jumping force, lowering the energy barrier for water transport through the alternating hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic matrix, but also act as an effective antifouling barrier, significantly reducing membrane fouling. The optimal HC83.0&#8208;PA&#8208;SO3H membrane exhibits a water permeance of 13.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8208;2&#8197;h&#8208;1&#8197;MPa&#8208;1, approximately 2.7&#8208;fold higher than that of the pristine PA membrane, and both high dyes and salts rejection efficiency. Moreover, the membrane sustains stable antifouling characteristics throughout a 19&#8208;day endurance test. This innovative membrane design provides a promising solution for the efficient separation of both dyes and inorganic salts in textile wastewater treatment.

         <title>Mussel Foot Protein Membrane&#8208;Enclosed Crystalline Drug with Zero&#8208;Order Release Kinetics for Long&#8208;Acting Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a mussel foot protein (Mfp) membrane&#8208;enclosed zero&#8208;order controlled release system by biomimicking the working principle of the mussel plaque. The thin membrane forms directly in situ on the surface of the crystalline drugs, achieving a high drug&#8208;loading capability. In streptozotocin&#8208;induced type 1 diabetic mice, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated insulin crystals can maintain blood glucose at normoglycemia for a week. Similarly, in healthy rats, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated progesterone crystals can maintain its plasma drug concentration for up to one week.







Abstract
Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half&#8208;life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane&#8208;enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro&#8208; and small&#8208;molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&gt;90&#8201;%). It exhibits sustained and zero&#8208;order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane&#8208;enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7&#8197;days. Meanwhile, membrane&#8208;coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7&#8197;days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35&#8197;days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and the treatment of distinct diseases.

         <title>Enhanced Water Permeation in Positively Charged Water Channels: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The higher permeability of positively charged water channels Ch+ arises from shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes and faster water rotation at the entrance. This is due to weaker H&#8208;bond interactions of NH3+ groups with water compared to COO&#8722; groups in negatively charged channels Ch&#8722;, and K+ ions around COO&#8722; slowing water rotation more than Cl&#8722; ions around NH3+.







Abstract
The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCs is influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar[5]arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (Ch+) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (Ch&#8722;). The higher permeability of Ch+ channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of Ch+. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in Ch+ and Ch&#8722; channels: the direct interactions of the NH3+/COO&#8722; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&#8722;/K+) around these charged groups. NH3+ groups in Ch+ channels exert less stable H&#8208;bond interaction with water than the COO&#8722; group in Ch&#8722; channels. K+ ions concentrated around the COO&#8722; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&#8722; ions around the NH3+ groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance AWCs at the molecular level.

         <dc:description>
The efficient enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral ferrocenes with a chiral aminoalcohol group was developed via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. The desired products were obtained in excellent yield with high enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) by using phosphine&#8211;olefin ligands with a planar chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold.







Abstract
Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring&#8208;opening of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin ligand consisting of a cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring&#8208;opening products in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of the starting 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring&#8208;opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.

         <title>Integrated Electrochemical Biomass Oxidation and CO2 Reduction over Ultra&#8208;wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

A Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V and a large CO partial current density of 608.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Integrated solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.

         <title>Ultrathin Polymersomes with Controllable Light&#8208;Responsivity via Adjusting the Electronic Effect from Para&#8208;Substituents of Azobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with vesicular thickness of ~2.0&#8197;nm were crafted using the self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs). The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transition toward these UTPS was achieved owing to the photo&#8208;isomerization feature of azobenzenes, where the isomerization rate of these UTPS is highly dependent on the electronic effect of the para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release performance using these light&#8208;responsive UTPSs as carriers proved the potential on bionanotechnology.







Abstract
Achieving ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with controllable light&#8208;responsive kinetics poses a prospective strategy to address the growing demands of intelligent and miniature systems, but it remains challenging. Herein, we reported the self&#8208;assembly of numerous side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs) into a series of UTPSs with diameters spanning 210&#8211;270&#8197;nm and ultrathin vesicular thickness spanning 1.91&#8211;2.14&#8197;nm. The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transitions for these UTPSs are rendered by the photo&#8208;isomerization of azobenzene moiety upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light. The systematical isomerization kinetic study proved that the light&#8208;responsive rate of distinct UTPSs was highly dependent on the electronic effect of para&#8208;substituents of azobenzenes within AAACs. Notably, the rate constant of electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro&#8208;modified UTPSs was 6.7&#8197;times greater than that of electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl&#8208;modified UTPSs. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release activity for different UTPSs was evaluated using a hydrophilic model drug of methylene blue (MB), with a light&#8208;controllable releasing performance that highly depended on the para&#8208;substituent&#8208;induced light&#8208;responsive kinetics. Our work offers an innovative strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a controllable responsive performance for the targeted applications in bionanotechnology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ionogels from Dynamic Polyrotaxane&#8208;Based Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes were designed by introducing ionic liquid to dynamically crosslinked polyrotaxane networks. The competitive coordination of lithium ions between the polymer chain segments and the ionic liquid molecular clusters facilitates lithium&#8208;ion migration. The ionogel electrolyte enables lithium symmetrical cells with stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours and the NMC622||Li battery with excellent rate and cycling performance at 20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The swelling of a polymer matrix by ionic liquids and additional lithium salts may lead to the formation of ionogel electrolytes. However, the introduction of additional ions usually results in a decreased lithium&#8208;ion transference number, because of the trapping of the lithium ions in clusters and polymer&#8208;ion complexes. Achieving highly efficient lithium&#8208;ion migration and increasing lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium&#8208;ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and tLi+=0.45 at 20&#8201;&#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium&#8208;lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20&#8201;&#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03&#8201;%). This work provides new insights for the design and synthesis of ionogel electrolytes, facilitating lithium ion migration within the electrolytes.

         <title>Modulated Multicomponent Reaction Pathway by Pore&#8208;Confinement Effect in MOFs for Highly Efficient Catalysis of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully modulated reaction pathway in the multicomponent reaction of propargylic amines, phosphine oxide and CO2 through the confinement effect of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a catalyst. The MOF with pores of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; can selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, preferentially react to form oxazolidinones, which further react with the phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce the final product. This result in high catalytic performance and excellent substrate generality.







Abstract
The conversion of flue gas CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals via multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers the advantages of atom economy, bond&#8208;formation efficiency and product complexity. However, because of the competition between reaction sequences and pathways among substrates, the efficient synthesize the desired product is a great challenge. Herein, a porous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free framework (Cu&#8208;TCA) was synthesized, which can highly effectively catalyze the multicomponent conversion of CO2 by modulating reaction pathways. The pores with the size of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; in Cu&#8208;TCA selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, At the same time, the larger&#8208;sized phosphine oxide is hindered outside the pores. Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO2 and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in Cu&#8208;TCA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of Cu&#8208;TCA with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.

Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2-oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in &lt;b&gt;Cu-TCA&lt;/b&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of &lt;b&gt;Cu-TCA&lt;/b&gt; with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Generation of Negative Hydrogen with Bimetallic&#8208;Ternary&#8208;Structured Catalysts for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen evolution form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1 and achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours using AB as H in converting nitrobenzene to anilines.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) with in situ negative hydrogen (H&#8722;) has received extensive attention as an alternative to conventional high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation processes. However, the insufficient activity of hydrogen production and unclear the conversion process of hydrogenation remain a great challenge. In this work, brand new bimetallic ternary&#8208;structured catalysts (Ru1+nM1&#8208;TiO2, M=Co, Cu, Fe, Ni) were synthesized to efficiently generate H&#8722; donors from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under moderate conditions. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen production form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours in converting nitrobenzene to anilines using AB. Mechanistic studies revealed that the high hydrolysis activity was due to that the Ru SA and Co SA sites of the bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalyst required the lowest energy for the activation of AB and H2O, respectively. Remarkably, the Co SA and Ru clusters exhibited an obvious synergistic effect in the TH process, which promoted the tandem hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. This work demonstrated an efficient approach to generate H&#8722; donor with bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts in TH process and further provided new inspiration on the development of multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme Surface Residues Direct Encapsulation into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Performance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to guide the formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by exposing surface residues of proteins, thereby embedding enzymes into MOFs. Nitrogen&#8208;enriched Cyt&#8197;c serves as a model to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, leading to significantly improve enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency. The strategy is applicable for a variety of enzymes, demonstrating the potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Herein, we highlight the role of nitrogen&#8208;enriched surface groups on proteins in directing topological transformations of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Using a modified&#8208;protein&#8208;directed MOFs template synthesis (mDTS) strategy, we demonstrate that these surface modifications on cytochrome c (Cyt&#8197;c) selectively induce the formation of leaf&#8208;like zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;L). This approach not only enables a structural transition from ZIF&#8208;8 to a more open ZIF&#8208;L framework but also substantially enhances the catalytic activity and loading of Cyt&#8197;c beyond traditional immobilization methods. Adjusting the concentration of the surface modifier allows for precise tuning of the Cyt&#8197;c activity, allowing optimal enzyme function at specific modifier levels. Furthermore, our results reveal that surface modifications of a variety of proteins can facilitate the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, emphasizing the broad applicability of the mDTS method. This approach offers significant promise for developing highly efficient protein&#8208;MOF composites, offering transformative potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Reduction and Biosynthesis Towards Sustainable CO2 Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

This work delivers a photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis tandem strategy towards upgrading CO2 into long&#8208;chain sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene, which offers a sustainable paradigm for CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added compounds.







Abstract
Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO2) into long&#8208;chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value&#8208;added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO2 reduction to energy&#8208;rich sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8722;ZnO). The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8722;ZnO preferentially reduces CO2 to CH4 with a production rate of 1539.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 90&#8201;%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#946;+). Subsequently, Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene using photocatalytically&#8208;obtained CH4 as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. This study provides a green, low&#8208;energy pathway for the synthesis of long&#8208;chain compounds from CO2 as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long&#8208;term energy demands and sustainable CO2 upcycling.

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given that chiral bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are stacked straight forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assembly, eight assemblies with different symmetries can be considered. In this study, seven of eight assemblies are selectively synthesized with minimal alternations in their molecular structures. These assemblies will be useful for the quantitative discussion for structure&#8211;property relationship.







Abstract
Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.

Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self-assembly pattern of bowl-shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of Alkenes and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a new masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent that enables previously inaccessible radical chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of alkenes, as well as highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of heteroarenes. The method involves conversion of the weakly electrophilic bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate into a masked electrophile, significantly increasing its reactivity, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Structural modification of drug candidates with fluorine atoms has revolutionized drug discovery, frequently enhancing pharmacological properties. However, the strategic integration of privileged bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol moiety remains challenging, primarily due to the overreliance on closed&#8208;shell strategies typically involving toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. Alternative radical&#8208;based strategies exist but are constrained by the inherently weak electrophilicity of the key bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate, significantly limiting the scope of accessible transformations. Here we report the development of a novel masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent, enabling the efficient generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical species with significantly enhanced electrophilicity under mild photocatalytic conditions. This approach facilitates chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates 515 candidate structures featuring a planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atom, adhering to the 18 valence electron rule and formulated as OXnYmq. Among these, 35 global minima were identified, primarily stabilized by Group 13 elements with charge states spanning &#8722;1 to +1. Notably, bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions&#8212;from covalent to polar ionic&#8212;that challenge traditional assumptions about unconventional oxygen bonding motifs.







Abstract
Planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atoms are rare, with only a few examples confirmed to date. This study systematically investigates 515 potential structures, formulated as OXnYmq, where n+m=4, q ranging from +2 to &#8722;2, and following the 18&#8208;valence electron rule. High&#8208;level ab initio calculations identified 35 global minima containing a ptO atom, predominantly stabilized by Group&#8197;13 elements. Bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions, from covalent to polar ionic, and confirms high electron delocalization. The findings challenge traditional bonding paradigms, improve the understanding of ptO&#8208;containing clusters, and propose viable ptO clusters for gas&#8208;phase detection, advancing the study of unconventional oxygen bonding.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Boosted Stability and Kinetics under a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce silk fibroin (SF) as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, boosting the reaction kinetics and cycling stability of aqueous Zn ion batteries across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. SF disrupts H&#8208;bond networks in H2O and coordinates Zn2+, reducing viscosity and suppressing side reactions. It also forms a hydrophilic/zincophilic SF&#8208;film on both electrodes, enabling uniform Zn plating and preventing cathode dissolution.







Abstract
Sustainable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) necessitate a wide operational temperature range to ensure practicability, yet achieving this often compromises either reaction kinetics at low temperatures or cycling stability at high temperatures. Here we present an electrolyte design that balances this trade&#8208;off, enhancing the stability and kinetics of AZIBs across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Our approach incorporates silk fibroin as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, which modifies both electrolyte structure and electrode interphase. Specifically, Zn||Zn half&#8208;cells with this electrolyte realize low hysteresis (180&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and stable operation (200&#8197;hours at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This electrolyte is compatible with both inorganic and organic cathode materials. Remarkably, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level Zn||V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&#8722;1 with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy provides a powerful solution to the challenges of aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries at extreme temperatures.

         <title>From Holodirected to Hemidirected Coordination Activated by Oxygenation Strategy: A Facile Route to Long Wave Infrared Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair electrons of Sb3+ in halides can be activated by oxygen atom, which inspired the creation of the first alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalide Rb2Sb2OCl6. Its birefringence has been increased by an order of magnitude compared with the holodirected coordination Rb13Sb8Cl37. Large&#8208;sized crystal measurements show that Rb2Sb2OCl6 features a good transmittance from 0.4 to 13.5&#8197;&#956;m, covering the near, mid and long wave infrared range, confirming its potential as a long wave infrared birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Long wave infrared (LWIR) birefringent crystals are essential for infrared optical applications but such materials are rarely reported due to the requirements of large birefringence and wide infrared transmission range. This study proposes a facile route to create new LWIR birefringent crystal by oxygenation strategy in halides with cations containing lone pair electrons. Given the tendency of such cations to form holodirected geometry, a divalent oxygen was introduced to substitute the monovalent halogen to decrease the coordination number and activate the lone pair electrons. Our efforts in Rb+&#8208;Sb3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; system result three new structures, namely, Rb13Sb8Cl37, Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6. The holodirected SbCl6 in Rb13Sb8Cl37 has been successfully translated to hemidirected SbOCl4 in Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6, which are the first examples in alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides. The birefringence of Rb2Sb2OCl6 reached to 0.191@550&#8197;nm, which is 11.2 times that of Rb13Sb8Cl37 (0.017@550&#8197;nm). Large&#8208;sized crystal of Rb2Sb2OCl6 have been successfully grown (6&#215;6&#215;2&#8197;mm3). It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4&#8211;13.5&#8197;&#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system &#8211; alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.

Our efforts in Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; system result three new structures, namely, Rb&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt;, Rb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;holodirected&lt;/i&gt; SbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in Rb&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; has been successfully translated to &lt;i&gt;hemidirected&lt;/i&gt; SbOCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in Rb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which are the first examples in alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides. The birefringence of Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; reached to 0.191@550&#8197;nm, which is 11.2 times that of Rb&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; (0.017@550&#8197;nm). Large-sized crystal of Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; have been successfully grown (6&#215;6&#215;2&#8197;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4&#8211;13.5&#8197;&#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system &#8211; alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Re and Ru Co&#8208;Doped Transition Metal Alloy as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Electrooxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru and Re co&#8208;doped NiCoFe alloy exhibited efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. By employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously with a stable operation over 450&#8197;h.







Abstract
Glycerol electrooxidation (GOR), as an innovative strategy for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, is considered a promising anodic alternative to oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalysis. However, the high potential and the limited selectivity and faradaic efficiency impede the industrial&#8208;scale application toward GOR. Herein, we for the first time constructed rhenium and ruthenium co&#8208;doped transition metal alloy (NiCoFeRuRe) for the efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. Benefiting from the rapid generation of M3+&#8208;OOH induced by Ru element and the inhibition of OER and excessive oxidation of glycerol by Re species through in situ chacterization, the optimized NiCoFeRuRe requires only 1.133 VRHE to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a faradaic efficiency of 95.6&#8201;% for formate product with a stability more than 450&#8197;h. Importantly, employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously, which is 265&#8197;mV lower than the electrolytic water splitting owning an excellent stability of 350&#8197;h. This work provides a facile strategy for rationally designing high&#8208;performance GOR catalysts for biomass upgradings.

         <title>Co Nanoparticle: An Efficient H&#8208;pump for Pt Single Atoms Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover</title>

A facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy is applied to create NMP&#8208;SACs consisting of Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC) for exceptional HER activity. As an H&#8208;pump, Con supply hydrogen for Pt1 sites through accelerated water dissociation, enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.







Abstract
Introducing OH&#8208;interaction sites to accelerate water dissociation can increase hydrogen coverage on active site surfaces and thus accelerate H&#8208;spillover, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent studies on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) combined with nano&#8208;metal&#8208;particles (NMPs) have developed various homologous NMP&#8208;SACs, however, synthesizing the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs remains a significant challenge. Particularly for HER catalysts under alkaline conditions, the ideal heterologous structure requires a synergy between non&#8208;noble NMPs with strong oxophilicity and noble&#8208;metal SAs with suitable hydrogen binding energy. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy to create the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs, comprising Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC). This catalyst demonstrates outstanding HER activity and superior stability in alkaline electrolyzer. Calculations reveal that Co nanoparticles serve as an H&#8208;pump, dissociating water to supply hydrogen to Pt1 sites, thereby enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.

         <title>Niobium Phosphide&#8208;Induced Sulfur Cathode Interface with Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Flux Enables Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbP induces the decomposition of lithium salts, which resulting in the formation of a LiF&#8208; and LiN&#8208;rich interfacial layer at the sulfur cathode interface for facilitating high&#8208;flux Li+ transport. The optimized interface reduces the conversion energy barrier of Li2S and effectively prevents the passivation of catalytic active sites.







Abstract
Research on the Li&#8722;S catalytic chemistry primarily focus on the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts and the exploration of their reaction mechanisms, with limited attention given to the impact on the interface at the cathode. Moreover, regulating the Li+ flux at the cathode interface can enhance Li2S conversion kinetics without compromising the intrinsic catalytic activity of catalyst. This work presents a paradigm that employs interface regulation to enhance Li&#8722;S battery (LSB) cycling stability. A novel phosphorus doped carbon supported niobium phosphide nanocrystals (NbP/PC) catalyst is developed and demonstrates exceptional intrinsic activity for lithium polysulfide conversion while it facilitates lithium salt dissociation through intermolecular hybridization. The NbP&#8208;induced functional interface layer with abundant LiF and Li3N provides efficient Li+ transport channel for Li2S decomposition, which further mitigates the passivation of active sites. In consequence, the assembled LSB exhibits a capacity retention rate of 0.04&#8201;% per cycle after 1100 cycles at a 1&#8197;C. Furthermore, the pouch battery with an energy density of 451&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 maintains stable performance over 20 cycles. This strategy addresses the limitations of traditional catalytic material design in the chemical regulation of the cathodic interface for promising future of LSBs.

         <title>Synthesis of Selenium&#8208;Doped Heteroacenes: Unveiling the External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes have been synthesized to unveil the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host molecules. Compared to oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based analogues, selenium&#8208;embedded host enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling, accelerates reverse intersystem crossing, and improves bipolar transport, enabling the assembly of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a wide color gamut.







Abstract
The internal heavy&#8208;atom effect (IHAE) has garnered considerable attention as a promising approach for developing highly efficient emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host materials, despite being equally important, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce a selenium&#8208;doping strategy to unlock the potential of EHAE in host molecules. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a straightforward method for synthesizing structurally diverse pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes via an intramolecular radical cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylselanyl)pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;amine derivatives. This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz&#8208;BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BFP) and sulfur&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz&#8208;BSeP significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz&#8208;BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high&#8208;performance, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut TADF&#8208;OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off.

     alt="Synthesis of Selenium-Doped Heteroacenes: Unveiling the External Heavy-Atom Effect in Host Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyridine-fused, selenium-containing heteroacenes have been synthesized to unveil the external heavy-atom effect (EHAE) in host molecules. Compared to oxygen- and sulfur-based analogues, selenium-embedded host enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling, accelerates reverse intersystem crossing, and improves bipolar transport, enabling the assembly of high-performance organic light-emitting diodes with a wide color gamut.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal heavy-atom effect (IHAE) has garnered considerable attention as a promising approach for developing highly efficient emitters in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the external heavy-atom effect (EHAE) in host materials, despite being equally important, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce a selenium-doping strategy to unlock the potential of EHAE in host molecules. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a straightforward method for synthesizing structurally diverse pyridine-fused, selenium-containing heteroacenes via an intramolecular radical cyclization of 2-(arylselanyl)pyridin-3-amine derivatives. This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz-BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen-based (DCz-BFP) and sulfur-based (DCz-BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz-BSeP significantly enhances spin-orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz-BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high-performance, wide-color-gamut TADF-OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll-off. Additionally, its successful application in phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph-OLEDs) and TADF-sensitized narrowband red fluorescence OLEDs (TSF-OLEDs) highlights its versatility in advancing OLED technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Bromine Battery with Highly Reversible Bromine Conversion Chemistry</title>

ZnSO4 solution is initially screened as the electrolyte for bromide cathodes. Subsequently, a targeted sequestration strategy is proposed to modify KBr cathode, achieving high&#8208;reversibility bromine conversion chemistry. In situ Raman spectra reveal a Br3&#8722;/Br&#8722;&#8208;dominated conversion mechanism. A large&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;Br pouch cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 98.46&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92&#8201;% after 775 cycles at 3&#8197;C.







Abstract
Br2/Br&#8722; conversion reaction with a high operating potential (1.85&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn) is promising for designing high&#8208;energy cathodes in aqueous Zn batteries. However, the ultrahigh solubility of polybromides causes significant shuttle effects, capacity deterioration, and self&#8208;discharge, rendering the study of static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries still in its infancy. Here, various aqueous zinc salt electrolytes are first screened, showing that, compared to other salts, ZnSO4 is more suitable for Br&#8208;based cathodes benefiting from its higher negative charge density and lower cost. Nevertheless, the significant shuttle effect of polybromides remains in such an electrolyte. We further develop a targeted sequestration strategy to fundamentally confine polybromide migration from KBr cathode into electrolyte. In high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading (22 mgKBr cm&#8722;2) pouch cells, the average Coulombic efficiency enhances from 92.3&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;%, and self&#8208;discharge performance dramatically improves from 17.4&#8201;% capacity retention to 85.2&#8201;% after 72&#8197;h of resting, indicating the effectiveness of our strategy in confining the shuttle effects. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell delivers an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.88&#8201;% and a zinc utilization of 22&#8201;% at a high rate of 3&#8197;C. Our findings also pave the way for the design of advanced Br&#8208;based cathodes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanochemical&#8208;assisted approach converts elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymers with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) junctions, mimicking natural leaves for efficient CO2 photoreduction with H2O, without additional photosensitizers, sacrificial agents, or cocatalysts. The key innovation is a mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction, enabling sustainable solid&#8208;state condensation of sulfur with 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes to form bent thianthrene units.

&lt;p&gt;A novel mechanochemical-assisted approach converts elemental sulfur into thianthrene-bridged porous ladder polymers with dense donor-acceptor (D-A) junctions, mimicking natural leaves for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, without additional photosensitizers, sacrificial agents, or cocatalysts. The key innovation is a mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction, enabling sustainable solid-state condensation of sulfur with 1,2-dihaloarenes to form bent thianthrene units.

         <title>Sustainable Pathways for the Synthesis of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite) plays a key role in construction as a hydraulic binder. Due to its instability in water, industrial production primarily relies on thermal dehydration of gypsum. This review examines alternative, potentially more sustainable methods for the synthesis of bassanite, including gypsum conversion at lower temperatures and direct precipitation from organic solvents or in the presence of specific additives. The benefits, drawbacks, and overall impact on sustainability of the different proposed approaches are critically assessed.







Abstract
Calcium sulfate, and especially its hemihydrate form (bassanite), is crucial in the construction industry, primarily used as a hydraulic binder in cements, mortars, and wallboards. Because of the rapid transformation of bassanite into thermodynamically stable gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) upon contact with water, natural deposits are scarce, rendering it one of the most extensively produced inorganic materials worldwide. Currently, bassanite is derived from mined or waste gypsum through a thermal dehydration process, which is energy&#8208;intensive and costly. As sustainability has become a key target for industrial processes and products, a series of studies aiming to increase the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of bassanite production was published recently. Two primary approaches are pursued: conversion of gypsum and direct precipitation of bassanite from solution. In both cases, organic solvents, (specific) additives and/or elevated temperatures have been used to control the activity/availability of water in the reaction medium and thus direct phase selection towards bassanite. This review offers a comprehensive overview of alternative bassanite production methods, critically examining their benefits, potential downsides, and overall impact on the sustainability of industrial&#8208;scale use.

         <title>Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of PFAS emission abatement, this minireview addresses catalytic gas phase PFAS decomposition and the associated overarching challenges involving fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and reaction engineering. In addition, concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions are introduced.







Abstract
While the outstanding stability of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) paved the way for their widespread application in a huge variety of applications, it also resulted in their nickname &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221;. The rising awareness for PFAS&#8208;related environmental and health concerns drives a discussion on the most effective ways to abate PFAS emissions into the environment, i.e. water, soil, and air, and remediation of contaminated matter. In order to address the knowledge gap regarding air pollution by PFAS, this minireview summarizes the current corpus of work in the field and outlines how catalysis can contribute to PFAS abatement in the gas phase. Beyond a mere collection of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, overarching challenges in catalytic PFAS removal are identified, spanning from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, i.e. C&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation, to heterogeneous catalysis, i.e. surface reactions at the gas&#8208;solid interface, to reaction engineering, i.e. scaling relations and technical hurdles. In addition, the article introduces concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereoelements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights recent advances in the construction of nonadjacent stereogenic elements and summarizes the various strategies employed, including bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis, and other approaches. The synthetic applications and mechanistic investigations are also discussed to facilitate understanding of this field.








Abstract
Nonadjacent chiral scaffolds are privileged motifs in bioactive molecules and medicines, which have stimulated chemists&#8217; ingenuity in achieving the asymmetric construction of non&#8208;contiguous chiral elements directly. Current strategies include bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis and others, enabling the production of a wide range of enantiomerically enriched compounds featuring different combinations of nonadjacent chirality, including multiple elements of central chirality, central and allenyl axial chirality, and central and biaryl axial chirality. As compared to the patterns of multiple nonadjacent elements of central chirality, the latter two are less frequently reported. This minireview aims to summarize the key developments in reaction design, mechanistic studies, and synthetic applications, with the goal of stimulating further exploration in this important area of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Sulfur Conversion to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder Polymer Networks through Mechanochemical Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state synthetic approach was developed to directly convert elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor molecular junctions, by exploiting mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting sulfur&#8208;rich conjugated polymer exhibits successful CO2 photoreduction with H2O vapor, without adding any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of synthetic methods capable of converting elemental sulfur into conjugated porous sulfur&#8208;rich polymers remains a great challenge, although direct utilization of this readily available feedstock can significantly enrich its uses and circumvent environmental problems during sulfur storage. We report herein mechanochemical (MC) nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) that enables sulfur conversion into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) molecular junctions. We demonstrate that the key lies in the generation of bent thianthrene units through a solid&#8208;state ball&#8208;milling condensation reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes and elemental sulfur. We also show that the assembling of D&#8722;A structural motifs into porous networks affords efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. Exceptional photoinduced charge separation along with boosted exciton dissociation results in a high&#8208;performance of carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 306.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by H2O oxidation to O2, as confirmed by both experimental and theoretical results. We anticipate this novel MC SNAr approach will advance processing techniques for direct sulfur utilization and facilitate new possibilities for the synthesis of D&#8722;A ladder polymer networks with promising potential in photocatalysis.

Abstract
Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET&#8208;based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB1R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB1R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB1R with comparable affinity (pKi=5.34 and 5.67, respectively).

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Highly O&#8208;Glycosylated MUC7 Glycopeptides for Probing Inhibitory Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of four highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing different glycoforms has been achieved via an efficient chemoenzymatic approach, relying on the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that sialylated glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
MUC7, a highly glycosylated protein in saliva and respiratory tract, plays potential roles in facilitating bacterial clearance and preventing microbial invasion. The complexity of glycan structures and multiplicity of glycosylation sites of MUC7 make it very difficult to explore accurate biofunctions against pathogens. Here, we report an efficiently convergent chemoenzymatic approach to firstly synthesize highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing various glycoforms via the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and enzymatic&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that different glycoforms of synthetic MUC7 glycopeptides mediate unique activities against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among which sialylated MUC7 glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity and has the potential to develop antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Cocatalyst for Hydroquinone Oxidation Enables Aerobic Oxidation of Primary Alcohols to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A commercially available heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst supports efficient aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone, outperforming homogeneous molecular cobalt and iron cocatalysts that have been used to support redox cascades. This Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/benzoquinone cocatalyst system supports the highly efficient oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a homogeneous Ir catalyst in organic solvent.







Abstract
Benzoquinone (BQ) is commonly used as a cocatalyst in multi&#8208;component catalyst systems for aerobic oxidation of organic molecules. Such methods often proceed by a redox cascade in which a secondary catalyst supports aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) to BQ. The present study shows that a commercially available non&#8208;precious metal heterogeneous catalyst, PAJ&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, is much more efficient than established homogeneous catalysts for aerobic oxidation of HQ to BQ, and this improved reactivity is crucial to support aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with the homogeneous iridium catalyst, [Ir(trop2DAD]OTf (trop2DAD=N,N&#8208;bis(5&#8208;H&#8208;dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene). The combination of this heterogeneous/homogeneous catalyst system operates with Ir catalyst loadings as low as 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover frequencies &#8805;350&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Reinforced Nonlinear Optical Performances Induced by P&#8208;P Homoatomic Bond in Phosphide SrIn3Si4P11</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn3Si4P11 demonstrates superior second&#8208;harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn3Si4P9.







Abstract
Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi&#8208;asymmetric&#8208;module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn3Si4P11, which showcases the characteristics of a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si3P10] and [In3P10] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8722;P bond distinguishes SrIn3Si4P11 from the kindred SrIn3Si4P9, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30&#8208;fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50&#8197;eV broadening in band gap compared to SrIn3Si4P9. Theoretically calculated analysis reveals that the &#960; interactions and the significant polarization anisotropy of the P&#8722;P bond are critical factors contributing to the enhancement of NLO performances. The present study uncovers the pivotal significance of P&#8722;P bond in structural design and NLO properties optimization, and delineates a clear research direction for the extensive advancement of phosphides NLO materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Arylations and Alkenylations of 2&#8208;Aminobiaryls with Atmospheric Air as the Sole Oxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a mild, enantioselective method for the arylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aminobiaryl compounds to produce highly valuable, enantioenriched anilines exhibiting axial chirality. The kinetic resolution process is catalyzed by Pd(II) in combination with an isobutyryl&#8208;protected isoleucine ligand (iBoc&#8208;Ile&#8208;OH), using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant and DMSO as cosolvent. The products can be divergently manipulated to give optically active, axially chiral derivatives of high interest for asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Optically active 2&#8208;aminobiaryls are valuable chiral frameworks with broad applications in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present a simple and practical methodology for their asymmetric synthesis via enantioselective palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations or alkenylations of racemic precursors. The methodology utilizes a kinetic resolution strategy, producing two highly valuable enantioenriched axially chiral molecules: the C&#8722;C coupling product and the unreacted starting material. Notably, we have established reaction conditions that enable the in situ regeneration of the active Pd(II) catalyst using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of this approach by preparing several derivatives relevant to the field of asymmetric catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;This paper describes a mild, enantioselective method for the arylation and alkenylation of 2-aminobiaryl compounds to produce highly valuable, enantioenriched anilines exhibiting axial chirality. The kinetic resolution process is catalyzed by Pd(II) in combination with an isobutyryl-protected isoleucine ligand (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Boc-Ile-OH), using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant and DMSO as cosolvent. The products can be divergently manipulated to give optically active, axially chiral derivatives of high interest for asymmetric catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optically active 2-aminobiaryls are valuable chiral frameworks with broad applications in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present a simple and practical methodology for their asymmetric synthesis via enantioselective palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations or alkenylations of racemic precursors. The methodology utilizes a kinetic resolution strategy, producing two highly valuable enantioenriched axially chiral molecules: the C&#8722;C coupling product and the unreacted starting material. Notably, we have established reaction conditions that enable the in situ regeneration of the active Pd(II) catalyst using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of this approach by preparing several derivatives relevant to the field of asymmetric catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme Controlled Transient Phospholipid Vesicles for Regulated Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the in situ formation of a phospholipid and its chemical energy driven assembly into transient vesicles. Our synthetic phospholipid vesicles, which are uniform and 65&#8197;nm in diameter, were obtained by a metabolism&#8208;like process i.e., formation by simply mixing the precursors and simultaneous degradation by an enzyme. This results in temporally controlled vesicles. Moreover, the cargo release from our vesicles can be dynamically regulated for drug delivery.







Abstract
Metabolism in biological systems involves the continuous formation and breakdown of chemical and structural components, driven by chemical energy. In specific, metabolic processes on cellular membranes result in in situ formation and degradation of the constituent phospholipid molecules, by consuming fuel, to dynamically regulate the properties. Synthetic analogs of such chemically fueled phospholipid vesicles have been challenging. Here we report a bio&#8208;inspired approach for the in situ formation of phospholipids, from water soluble precursors, and their fuel driven self&#8208;assembly into vesicles. We show that the kinetic competition between anabolic and catabolic&#8208;like reactions leads to the formation and enzymatic degradation of the double&#8208;tailed, vesicle&#8208;forming phospholipid. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis demonstrate the formation of transient vesicles whose lifetime can be easily tuned from minutes to hours. Importantly, our design results in the formation of uniform sized (65&#8197;nm) vesicles simply by mixing the precursors, thus avoiding the traditional complex methods. Finally, our sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm vesicles are of the right size for application in drug delivery. We have demonstrated that the release kinetics of the incorporated cargo molecules can be dynamically regulated for potential applications in adaptive nanomedicine.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry in a Capillary Applied to the Facilitation of the Crystalline Sponge Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;One&#8208;droplet&#8221; host&#8211;guest chemistry was achieved by using a glass capillary, enabling the efficient crystallization and structure determination of various host&#8211;guest complexes. Two coordination hosts, the cage and the crystalline sponge (CS), were examined. Notably, using a capillary addressed several persistent technical challenges in the CS method, greatly simplifying and accelerating the analysis of molecular structures.







Abstract
Capillary is a handy tool for transferring, mixing, and storing small volumes of liquid. Here, we show that the stepwise dipping of host and guest solutions into a capillary allows efficient preparation, crystallization, and X&#8208;ray analysis of various host&#8211;guest complexes. The crystals formed in capillaries are comparable in quality to those grown in regular flasks and subjected to X&#8208;ray analysis without being removed from the capillary. We further apply the capillary technique to the crystalline sponge method, a practical domain of host&#8211;guest chemistry, successfully overcoming several technical issues.

         <title>Lithium Anionic Dicarbenes or Acetylides: What is in the Name?</title>

The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called lithium anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC). X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies reveal that Li(ADC) exist as lithium acetylides Li(ACT). Exposure of Li(ACT) to CO2 and N2O readily afford ADC&#8208;compounds Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] and Li[(ADC)N2O], respectively.







Abstract
The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts (IPr&#8208;Ar)X (1&#8208;Ar)X (IPr&#8208;Ar = ArC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Ar = Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (2&#8208;Ar) (ADC = ArC{N(Dipp)C}2). 2&#8208;Ar can be used to prepare a variety of main group heterocycles, however their structures in the solid&#8208;state remained hitherto unknown. Herein reported single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal an acetylide type [ArC{N(Dipp)}(Dipp)NC&#8801;CLi)]n (3&#8208;Ar) dimeric (n = 2) or trimeric (n = 3) molecular structure for 2&#8208;Ar. Treatment of 3&#8208;Ph with Et3B cleanly yields the monoanionic carbene Li[(ADC)(BEt3)] (4&#8208;Ph) featuring a weakly coordinating anion embedded in the same molecular entity. 3&#8208;Ar readily undergo reactions with CO2 and N2O to form the ring&#8208;closing products Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] (5&#8208;Ar) and Li[(ADC)N2O] (6&#8208;Ar), respectively.

         <title>Borohydride Oxidation as Counter Reaction in Reductive Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, anodic borohydride oxidation is demonstrated to have great potential for successfully replacing sacrificial metal anodes in a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic counter reaction effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 at inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.







Abstract
An efficient reaction at the counter electrode is of key importance for the success of net oxidative and net reductive electrochemical transformations. For electrooxidative processes, cathodic proton reduction to H2 serves as the benchmark counter reaction. In contrast, net reductive electrochemical transformations have less attractive oxidative counter reactions to choose from and commonly rely on dissolution of a sacrificial anode that effectively results in stoichiometric metal consumption for the processes. In this study, we demonstrate that anodic borohydride oxidation has great potential to successfully replace the use of such sacrificial anodes for a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic transformation effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 using inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of the first stable geminal 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane is reported. Remarkably, the novel 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane exhibits three distinct structural motifs in the solid state, which are determined by the synthesis conditions: (1)&#8197;an unsolvated co&#8208;aggregate of two 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannanes with two silyllithium molecules; (2)&#8197;an ionic solvated trimeric stannyllithium dianion associated with two THF&#8208;solvated Li+ cations; (3)&#8197;a THF&#8208;solvated dimeric contact&#8208;ion pair of 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane.







Abstract
The synthesis of the first isolable geminal 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane is reported. In the solid state, the novel 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane has three different structural motifs, depending on the reaction conditions used for its synthesis: (1)&#8197;an unsolvated co&#8208;aggregate consisting of two 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane molecules and two silyllithium molecules, {[(tBu2MeSi)2SnLi2]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[tBu2MeSiLi]2}; (2)&#8197;a solvated trimeric stannyllithium dianion {[(tBu2MeSi)2Sn]3Li4}2&#8722; associated with two fully dissociated THF&#8208;solvated Li+ cations; (3)&#8197;a THF&#8208;solvated contact&#8208;ion pair dimer of 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane, [(tBu2MeSi)2SnLi2]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(THF)4.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Dual Ammonia Activation and Transfer by an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Boryloxy Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the first single&#8208;site main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dual activation of ammonia (NH3) to hydrogen (H2) using a low&#8208;valent aluminyl compound. This transformation is driven by a (coordination/proton shuttling) N&#8722;H oxidative addition pathway and selective protonolysis. These findings highlight the potential of main&#8208;group complexes in traditionally transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dominated transformations.







Abstract
The reactivity of an N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligated aluminyl compound has been harnessed for main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative dual activation of ammonia. The Al(I) system K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al] reacts with excess NH3 to give the Al(III) bis(amide) K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] and in the process generates H2. The initial stage of the reaction proceeds via formal N&#8722;H oxidative addition at Al(I) (via a coordination/proton shuttling sequence) to give an aluminium(III) primary amido hydride. Subsequent protonolysis of the strongly hydridic Al&#8722;H bond selectively yields the corresponding aluminium bis(amide) and H2. This step occurs without competing protolytic ligand loss &#8211; exploiting the limited basicity of the supporting [(boryl)O]&#8722; donors. In terms of amide transfer reactivity, the utility of K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] in delivering one or both equivalents of [NH2]&#8722; to electrophilic substrates (HBpin, CO2 and Ph2CO) has been demonstrated.

         <title>Photogeneration and Visualization of a Surface&#8208;Stabilized Dinitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication we report the formation of a stable, surface&#8208;supported dinitrene achieved through the photolysis of a diazide precursor on an Au(111) metal substrate. We combine high&#8208;resolution scanning probe techniques with theoretical calculations, providing the first real&#8208;space imaging of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface and exploring the associated photoreaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nitrenes are known as key intermediates in various chemical reactions. Nitrene transfer reactions are particularly effective for synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, where metal catalysts play a crucial role in controlling nitrene reactivity and selectivity. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a stable surface&#8208;supported dinitrene on Au(111) through UV irradiation of its diazide precursor, characterized by scanning probe techniques. The photoreaction mechanism is elucidated with wavelength&#8208;dependent experiments and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. Our findings present the first real&#8208;space visualization of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface, highlighting its potential in catalysis and surface functionalization.

         <title>Promoting the Kinetics of Ethylene Electrosynthesis via the Facet&#8208;Dependent Activation of Acetylene over Silver Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;dependent acetylene activation phenomenon over silver (Ag) catalysts is discovered, and Ag (100) is selected as a suitable candidate to increase the hydrogenation kinetics to improve the activity of ethylene electrosynthesis through the electrocatalytic acetylene conversion process. In addition, the activation of acetylene (C2H2) is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of acetylene hydrogenation, guiding future catalyst design.







Abstract
Metallic silver (Ag) sites exhibit a robust ability to suppress undesired C&#8722;C coupling in the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) into ethylene (ESAE), leading to satisfactory selectivity and stability. However, the relatively low reaction kinetics still hinder its practical value. Here, the facet&#8208;dependent ESAE performance is first evaluated to increase the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics and provide mechanistic insight for subsequent catalyst design. As a result, the Ag nanocubes with {100} surfaces demonstrate a partial current density of 337&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, greatly outperforming their counterparts with {111} surfaces exposed. Further comparisons of H2O splitting and C2H2 hydrogenation reveal that the activation of C2H2 is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of ethylene electrosynthesis. Additionally, experimental and theoretical mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that stronger C2H2 adsorption over the {100} surface strengthens the &#960; conjugation of C2H2, leading to the delocalization of &#960; electrons to promote the activation of C2H2 for enhanced hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>Dynamic Ultralong Phosphorescence and Optical Waveguiding Switches in Silver&#8208;Organic Complex via Reversible Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal conversion and the heavy&#8208;atom effect, dynamically controllable ultralong phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable optical waveguide can be designed within an Ag&#8208;organic complex. This approach provides a straightforward way to expand room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence towards intelligent switches and Information storage.







Abstract
Dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have attracted considerable interest for applications in sensors, light&#8208;emitting devices, and information security. Here, we introduce a novel class of silver (Ag)&#8208;organic complexes exhibiting rare, direct ultralong RTP, achieved through the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Ag+ ions and highly ordered assembly of coordination polymers. The Ag&#8208;based complex displays reversible solvent&#8208;responsive RTP, shifting from green to yellow emission in response to humidity and solvent variations. This transformation is driven by a solvent&#8208;mediated single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) conversion, enabling color&#8208;tunable active optical waveguides and one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polarization switching. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for creating dynamically controllable ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic complexes and advances the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive 1D photonic systems for promising information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Engineering 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate Aldolase for anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is promoted by an engineered variant of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA), giving rise to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent enantiopurity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
The enzyme 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) naturally catalyzes the reversible aldol addition between acetaldehyde and D&#8208;glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate to yield 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate. Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non&#8208;natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. This repurposed aldolase, named DERA&#8208;EP, is able to utilize H2O2 to accomplish both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA&#8208;EP in a substrate&#8208;free and substrate&#8208;bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented anti&#8208;selectivity of DERA&#8208;EP with multiple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the syn&#8208;selectivity of previously reported enzyme&#8208;, metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysts, making DERA&#8208;EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.
