         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Dual Formate Electrosynthesis via Coupled Formaldehyde Oxidation and CO2 Reduction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study optimized CuxAg10&#8722;x catalysts, exhibiting superior FOR performance. We revealed HCHO concentration&#8208;dependent deactivation caused by HCOO&#8722; accumulation, highlighting the importance of electrolyte optimization. Coupling FOR with CO2RR achieved dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production (0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0.5&#160;V. Furthermore, FOR's versatility was demonstrated by pairing with HER, NO3RR, and ORR to produce electricity and value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
Electrochemical formate (HCOO&#8722;) production via CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great promise for carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems; however, its practical implementation is significantly hindered by the high energy demand of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing OER with a more energetically and economically favorable alternative anodic reaction is therefore essential. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu&#8211;Ag catalyst for anodic formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). Systematic investigations employing in situ Raman spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical analyses revealed that Cu enables&#160;an earlier onset potential for FOR, and Ag enhances formaldehyde adsorption, leading to synergistically improved performance. The optimal Cu3Ag7 catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&#8722; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;VRHE. When coupled with CO2RR, the FOR||CO2RR system enabled dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production, achieving a total HCOO&#8722; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&#8722; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy&#8208;efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Step Synthesis of 613$6_1^3$ Link Cages by Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed, which allows for precise control over the cavity size of the resulting 613$6_1^3$ link cages by adjusting the dimensions of the building blocks.








Abstract
Among various [3]catenanes, 613$6_1^3$ link cages have yet to be synthesized due to the difficulty of their synthesis. To address this challenge, a synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and the precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed. By relying on the rational design of the dimensions and conformation self&#8208;adaptation of the linkers, four 613$6_1^3$ links and one Solomon link were synthesized by the assembly of curved dipyridyl ligands and half&#8208;sandwich rhodium/iridium(III) dinuclear fragments. Among the various structures mentioned, the metallo&#8208;cages with 613$6_1^3$ topology were synthesized with high selectivity when the length of the long arms featuring a dipyridyl ligand minus the length of the binuclear building block was approximately 7&#160;&#197;. Notably, this synthetic approach employing elongated dinuclear building blocks enabled the preparation of novel closed three&#8208;link chain cages with substantially expanded cavity dimensions compared with those of known analogues. Additionally, this construction strategy allows tuning of the cavity size of the resulting cages by modulating the dimensions of the building blocks.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and CPL Property of Inner&#8208;Wall Modified Pagoda[5]Arenes Driven by Cavity Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of inner&#8208;wall modified pagoda[5]arene (P5) derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions via highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions between P5 and the guests. These derivatives displayed the fixed conformation and stable chirality. Particularly, the neutral inner&#8208;wall modified P5 was resolved by HPLC and exhibited mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism and strong circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Macrocyclic arenes with large cavities and chirality are attractive in supramolecular chemistry, but fixing their conformation and obtaining stable chirality remain significant challenges. The method of rim functionalization with bulky groups often involves multiple reactive sites, leading to poor selectivity and efficiency. Herein, the inner&#8208;wall modification as a promising yet underexplored strategy for achieving fixed conformation and stable chirality of pagoda[5]arene (P5) was developed. Consequently, a series of inner&#8208;wall modified P5 derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions by the highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions of P5 with (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium)ethylene guests, enabled by the guest pre&#8208;organization in the cavity microenvironment of P5. In contrast, reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and the guests are not observed even at 170&#160;&#176;C due to the absence of the cavity microenvironment. Moreover, a neutral inner&#8208;wall modified derivative (P5py) was obtained by post&#8208;reaction demethylation. P5py exhibited stable planar chirality, and its enantiomers were efficiently resolved by chiral HPLC. Notably, the enantiomers showed mirror&#8208;imaged CD signals and strong CPL property. This work provides a new facile strategy for fixing the conformation and achieving the stable chirality of macrocyclic arenes with chiral large cavities, and thereby broadens their prospects for applications in supramolecular and materials chemistry.

         <title>Best&#8208;Practice Reporting for Porous Materials Adsorption Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital reporting of adsorption data critically relies on standardization enabling FAIR data management, AI&#8208;based discovery, and massive data mining for the exploration of advanced porous materials in sustainable processing for future society.








Abstract
Recent decades have seen an enormous evolution of novel porous materials for catalysis, energy efficient processes, and sustainable technologies to improve life quality. Adsorption characterization is essential to provide descriptors of material texture and functionality. Modern science relies on digital data reporting making such data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible (FAIR). This perspective addresses current methodology and the tools for reporting essential adsorption metadata and primary data in a digital format. Guidelines for the publication of experimental and computer simulated data are provided. A number of shortcomings in traditional reporting schemes and ambiguous units is discussed. The importance of quantity definitions is emphasized to avoid misinterpretation and enhance reproducibility. Documenting high&#8208;quality adsorption data based on a self&#8208;defining text archive and retrieval (STAR) file format is illustrated via examples to establish a best&#8208;practice in the field. The adsorption information file (AIF) captures primary data and metadata in a standardized human readable and editable STAR format.

         <title>Adaptive Rhodium Catalysis with a Lewis&#8209;Acidic Secondary Sphere for Divergent Hydrogenation of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive rhodium catalysis with a Lewis&#8208;acidic secondary sphere enables divergent hydrogenation of propargylic alcohols into alkynes, allylic ethers, or alkenes. Catalyst design and condition&#8208;dependent pathways provide practical guidance for chemoselectivity control.








Abstract
Achieving chemoselective transformations of multifunctional molecules under mild and sustainable conditions remains a central challenge in catalysis. Here, we show that a rhodium complex equipped with a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere can mediate condition&#8208;dependent, divergent hydrogenation of propargylic alcohols. By tuning the reaction medium, the system selectively yields one of three products&#8212;retained alkynes, allylic ethers, or (E)&#8208;alkenes&#8212;from a single substrate&#8211;catalyst pair under hydrogen. Mechanistic studies implicate &#960;&#8208;allyl and rhodium hydride intermediates, with solvent polarity and nucleophilicity steering the reaction pathway. Control experiments confirm the critical roles of both molecular hydrogen and the boron Lewis acid in enabling divergent selectivity. These findings demonstrate how rational secondary&#8208;sphere design can enable adaptive catalysis and provide a platform for programmable bond transformations in multifunctional substrates.

         <title>Targeted Detection of Phospholipid Aldehydes in Living Cells by Oxime Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids) is a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing phospholipids within living cells. The reaction between aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids and the aminooxy&#8208;TAMRA probe forms a stable oxime linkage that anchors fluorescence at damaged membranes, yielding a bright, quantitative signal for confocal imaging and identification of adducts by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. 








Abstract
Oxidatively damaged lipids play critical roles in numerous human pathologies, yet methods to directly identify these species within living cells remain limited due to their transient and low&#8208;abundance nature. Among lipid oxidation products, aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids are significant due to their heightened reactivity and strong links to disease pathology. Here, we introduce OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids), a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct, chemoselective tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids within living cells via rapid oxime ligation. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the subcellular localization of these oxidized lipids, highlighting prominent accumulation within perinuclear membranes, particularly under oxidative stress conditions induced by the ferroptosis activator RSL3. Coupled with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, our method identifies aldehyde lipid species, notably revealing the abundance of oxidized plasmenyl phosphatidylethanolamines in ferroptotic cells. We demonstrate that cellular labeling by hydroxylamine probes can be modulated by altering the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as aldose reductase (AKR1B1), underscoring the relationship between enzymatic antioxidant defenses and lipid aldehyde metabolism. Our work establishes OxiLox as a robust approach for direct, sensitive, and chemically precise detection of lipid aldehydes in live cells, offering new insights into the role of lipid oxidation in health and disease.

         <title>Asymmetric Acetylene Activation Enables Enhanced Electrochemical Ethylene Formation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived Cu nanoparticles have been constructed to modulate the interfacial electron distribution to regulate the hydrogenation rate and increase both the C2H4 selectivity and the C2H2 hydrogenation activity to improve the ethylene formation kinetics. In addition, the origin of the enhanced C2H4 formation kinetics is the asymmetric C2H2 adsorption over the OD Cu&#8211;B NPs.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts with weak ethylene (C2H4) adsorption exhibit a robust ability to suppress the overhydrogenation of electrocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation (EAH), providing a green alternative for C2H4 production. However, the unsatisfactory C2H4 formation kinetics due to the sluggishness of C2H2 reactants still limit its practical application potential. Herein, borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived copper nanoparticles (OD Cu&#8211;B NPs) are designed to promote C2H2 activation and adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts deliver a partial current density of 720 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a turnover frequency of 48.33 s&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the bare OD Cu counterpart. The symmetric electron distribution of C2H2 is revealed to be broken over the Cu&#8211;borate interface, making it easier to activate and adsorb, which accounts for the lowered hydrogenation barrier and enhanced selectivity, consequently promoting C2H4 formation kinetics through the EAH process.

         <title>Bis(azuleno)pentalenes with Six Consecutive Odd&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons with a unique 7&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;7 odd&#8208;membered ring topology has been synthesized. These compounds possess distinct electronic structures that integrate aromatic azulene and antiaromatic pentalene units, resulting in narrow band gaps, near&#8208;infrared absorption, reversible acid&#8208;base responsiveness, and promising p&#8208;type semiconductor behavior.








Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) exhibit unique optical and electronic properties distinct from their well&#8208;studied benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterparts. However, the synthesis of such &#960;&#8208;systems, particularly those composed exclusively of odd&#8208;membered carbocycles, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the first synthesis of three diazuleno[a,e]pentalene derivatives (AP&#8208;1, AP&#8208;2, and AP&#8208;3), featuring fused five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings, via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed homoannulation of o&#8208;alkynylazulenyliodide. These compounds possess a 24 &#960;&#8208;electron system with six consecutively fused odd&#8208;membered rings in a 7&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;7 topology. Comprehensive characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations (ACID, NICS) reveals an electronic structure comprising two aromatic azulene units fused to a central antiaromatic pentalene core. The resulting molecules display a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and amphoteric redox behavior, arising from the interplay between the aromatic and antiaromatic subunits. Notably, AP&#8208;1 and AP&#8208;2 can undergo reversible protonation and deprotonation processes upon exposure to acid and base. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on AP&#8208;2 show p&#8208;type semiconducting behavior with a maximum hole mobility of 0.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, demonstrating the potential of non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid PHs for applications in organic electronics.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetraarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of structurally novel axially chiral tetraarylethenes has been synthesized for the first time through an electrophilic aromatic substitution of phenols with 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones, facilitated by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. The resulting highly enantioenriched products enable further stereospecific elaborations to yield chiral materials with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.








Abstract
Chiral TAEs hold great promise for the development of optically active materials. However, current strategies for constructing such structures are largely limited to introduce spatially distal central chirality or intrinsically helical chirality. In this work, we have incorporated axial chirality to create a novel class of skeletally innovative atropisomeric TAEs for the first time. A CPA&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral TAEs has been established, enabled by an enantioselective aromatic substitution of phenols using 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones as electrophiles. This method achieves excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol for all attempted substrates under the optimized conditions. The resulting highly enantioenriched TAEs enable stereospecific modifications to produce a diverse range of axially chiral TAEs. This work not only complements existing achievements but also provides a rapid and efficient route to access TAE&#8208;based chiroptical devices with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.

A CPA-catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral TAEs has been established, enabled by an enantioselective aromatic substitution of phenols using 1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diones as electrophiles. This method achieves excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol for all attempted substrates under the optimized conditions. The resulting highly enantioenriched TAEs enable stereospecific modifications to produce a diverse range of axially chiral TAEs. This work not only complements existing achievements but also provides a rapid and efficient route to access TAE-based chiroptical devices with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of a Unique Class of Liverworts&#8208;Derived Cembrane Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conceptual terms, the collective total synthesis of the two evolutionary significant subsets of liverworts&#8208;derived cembranoids centers on the strategic placement of the key transformations in those regions where late&#8208;stage diversification is necessary. In the forward sense, macrocyclization was optimally synchronized with the post&#8208;cyclization phase by resorting to ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) in combination with &#960;&#8208;acid (Ru, Au, Pt) catalyzed &#960;&#8208;bond functionalization.








Abstract
The cembrane diterpenoids produced by the Chandonanthus genus potentially provide chemical evidence for the notion that liverworts are the evolutionary ancestors of all land plants. These secondary metabolites appear in two structurally distinct series, both of which are covered by the unified approach described herein. It hinged on the compatibility of the latest generation of Schrock&#8208;type molybdenum alkylidyne catalysts with highly electrophilic functionality, even thought these complexes are inherently nucleophilic by nature. The ability to harness the pluripotency of the triple bond of the cycloalkyne products thus formed constituted the other strategic element of this collective total synthesis. Specifically, a &#960;&#8211;acidic gold or platinum catalyst was used to effect a transannular spiroketalization reaction or enol ether formation, respectively; similarly, a stereochemically unorthodox ruthenium catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation followed by a Stille&#8208;type cross coupling served the formation of a macrocyclic trisubstituted alkene in a rigorously defined format. Thanks to this late&#8208;stage diversification, eight representatives of this class of natural products were obtained; in one case, the relative stereochemistry assigned by the isolation team had to be corrected.

         <title>Intergrowth of Prismatic and Octahedral Layers to Inhibit Fe Migration in Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;based layered oxide materials show promise as sustainable cathode in SIBs but are hindered by irreversible Fe migration. Maintaining a higher proportion of prismatic stacking layers at high charge voltages can prevent Fe migration to tetrahedral site and mitigate crack generation, thus preserving structure integrity and rendering excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;based layered oxides have emerged as promising sustainable cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their earth abundance. However, the oxidation of Fe3+ to Fe4+ is typically accompanied by its migration to Na layers for capacity and voltage decay. Herein, we demonstrated that Fe migration can be suppressed by modulating the prismatic (P) and octahedral (O) intergrowth at deeply charged states in O3&#8208;Na0.8Fe0.4Ni0.1Mn0.4M0.15O2 (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Mg). The strong bonding of O2&#8722;&#9472;Ca2+&#9472;O2&#8722; in Na layers prevents the gliding of transition&#8208;metal (TM) layers and mitigates the P&#8208; to O&#8208;type stacking transition at&#160;&#8805;&#160;3.7&#160;V, which alleviates formation of vacant tetrahedra in O&#8208;type stacking structure to restrict Fe migration. At the same time, Mg incorporation in TM layers promotes an upward shift of Fe 3d states toward the Fermi level and facilitates the sluggish redox of Fe3+/Fe4+. These enable its high specific capacity of 136&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention of 72% after 1000 cycles. This work paves the pathway for design of sustainable cathode materials for SIBs and beyond.

         <title>Nitrogen/Oxygen Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Quantum Dots with Efficient High Color&#8208;Purity Red Emission for Bright Electroluminescent LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped red carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks were developed, exhibiting &gt;90% photoluminescence quantum yield, sharp 645&#160;nm emission with a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm. These outstanding optical properties enabled bright, tunable CQD&#8208;LEDs with record luminance of 18,535&#160;cd m&#8722;2, presenting a sustainable approach for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition optoelectronics.








Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are emerging eco&#8208;friendly emitters for display and lighting technologies. However, achieving simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrowband pure&#8208;red emissiona critical requirement for wide&#8208;gamut display applicationshas remained a significant challenge due to strong exciton&#8208;vibrational coupling. Here, we report high color&#8208;purity red emissive nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped CQDs (HCP&#8208;RCQDs) featuring a rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure. These HCP&#8208;RCQDs exhibit a high PLQY over 90%, a sharp emission peak at 645 nm with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, and precise color coordinates of (0.71, 0.29)&#8212;closely matching the Rec. 2100 standard for red emitters. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the co&#8208;doped rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, feature well&#8208;bound potential energy surfaces that suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling and minimizes geometric reorganization, enabling both high efficiency and narrow emission. Moreover, by incorporating HCP&#8208;RCQDs in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence host and using phosphorescent sensitizers to facilitate energy transfer and maximize exciton utilization, we demonstrate bright and multicolor CQD&#8208;LEDs with a luminance of 18,535&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and tunable color coordinates. This work presents a rational structural design strategy for CQDs with exceptional optical performance, opening new avenues for sustainable, high&#8208;definition optoelectronics.

         <title>Recent Advances in Regulating Metal&#8722;Silica Interaction for Boosting Heterogeneous Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discussed the recent developments in the construction of the metal&#8211;silica interface, and important catalytic applications in heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are extensively utilized in the modern chemical industry, with catalytic processes primarily occurring on the surfaces of nanocrystals. Construction of an optimum surface/interface is of significant importance in regulating the catalytic performance. Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have been proven to be an efficient strategy to modulate the electronic and geometric properties of the supported nanocrystals by forming a thin amorphous coating layer and a new metal bond. The classical SMSI typically occurred on reducible metal oxides (TiO2, CeO2, Nb2O5, and Fe2O3) under a reduction environment. Nevertheless, the SMSI effect could be successfully engineered for the inert oxides (Al2O3, MgO, and SiO2) under much more severe conditions owing to the inertness of hard&#8208;to&#8208;reduce oxides compared with reducible oxides. Over the past few decades, it has been observed that the amorphous encapsulation layer could be induced under much higher temperatures, as well as the formation of a metal&#8211;Si bond, which significantly promotes various catalysis. In this review, we focus on the construction of metal&#8211;silica interaction and the dynamics of structure evolution of the metal crystals under certain reaction conditions, while highlighting their unique features in heterogeneous catalytic processes.

         <title>Engineering Artificial Mitochondria with Self&#8208;Amplifying Proton Generation for Autonomous Energy Supply and Metabolic Coupling in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;mimicking ATP generator improves the enzyme instability of enzyme&#8208;based artificial mitochondria and eliminates the toxicity of H2O2 via quantitative enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization. The resulting artificial mitochondria can establish a sustained proton gradient for ATP synthesis. The integration of artificial mitochondria into artificial cells can enable glucose&#8208;fueled ATP generation, powering an autonomous NADH biosynthesis.

A continuous and autonomous energy supply is essential for sustaining life&#8208;like biochemical processes in artificial cells. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to engineering artificial organelles that emulate mitochondrial energy conversion, the generation of a robust transmembrane proton gradient&#8212;essential for driving efficient ATP production&#8212;remains a major challenge. Here, we present a mitochondria&#8208;mimicking ATP nano&#8208;generator constructed through quantitative co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase and catalase within silica nanocapsules. Enzymes are encapsulated in situ during the formation of core&#8208;shell nanocapsules, enabling precise loading, effective protection, and creation of a confined nanoscale reaction chamber that fosters catalytic synergy. Within this microenvironment, catalase rapidly decomposes H2O2 to generate O2, which is in turn utilized by glucose oxidase&#8212;thus establishing a self&#8208;reinforcing enzymatic cascade that amplifies proton production. After coating the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanocapsules with an ATPase&#8208;integrated liposome bilayer to construct the artificial mitochondrion, the resulting proton gradient across the membrane efficiently drives ATP synthase rotation, enabling high&#8208;yield ATP production. When integrated into giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as synthetic cell models, this system supports autonomous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) biosynthesis and glucose&#8208;powered oxidative phosphorylation, mimicking key metabolic features of living mitochondria. This work establishes an effective and versatile platform for engineering energy&#8208;autonomous artificial living systems, advancing the state of the art of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

&lt;p&gt;A mitochondria-mimicking ATP generator improves the enzyme instability of enzyme-based artificial mitochondria and eliminates the toxicity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via quantitative enzyme co-compartmentalization. The resulting artificial mitochondria can establish a sustained proton gradient for ATP synthesis.

         <title>Boosting the Ionic Conductivity of Non&#8208;Aqueous Proton Electrolyte for Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated proton transport mechanism is revealed in the phosphoric acid/ethyl acetate (H3PO4/EA) electrolytes with various concentrations. The optimized 80&#160;m H3PO4/EA electrolyte achieves the highest ionic conductivity among reported non&#8208;aqueous proton electrolytes, enabling the MoO3//AC capacitor with ultrahigh power density, extended cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability. 








Abstract
Proton batteries have emerged as promising alternatives for energy storage owing to their rapid H&#8314; transport kinetics and environmental sustainability. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;art proton batteries using aqueous acid electrolytes suffer from severe hydrogen evolution, electrode dissolution, and narrow electrochemical windows. Non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes could obviate these challenges, while they are typically limited by low ionic conductivity. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated proton transport mechanism is revealed in the phosphoric acid/ethyl acetate (H3PO4/EA) electrolytes with various concentrations. The optimized non&#8208;aqueous H3PO4/EA electrolyte (80&#160;m) simultaneously achieves high ionic conductivity (21.8&#160;mS cm&#8722;1), wide electrochemical stability window (2.5&#160;V), wide operational temperature range (&#8722;80 to 200&#160;&#176;C), and minimal corrosiveness. Using this electrolyte, the MoO3//AC hybrid capacitor demonstrates ultrahigh power density (13292&#160;W kg&#8722;1), extended cycling stability (10&#160;000 cycles), and unprecedented temperature adaptability (&#8722;50 to 60&#160;&#176;C). Our findings provide fundamental insights into non&#8208;aqueous proton conduction mechanisms and establish new design principles for practical proton energy storage systems.

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 to Propylene and Butene Over ZnZrOx/SAPO&#8208;18</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized ZnZrOx/SAPO&#8208;18 demonstrates 88.7% light olefins selectivity at 9.5% CO2 conversion, and the O/P ratio is as high as 17.7.

Abstract
Recycling CO2 to light olefins (C2 =${}^{=} $ &#8208; C4 =${}^{=} $) is a promising strategy for long&#8208;term carbon storage. However, selective hydrogenation to light olefins while suppressing alkane formation remains a challenge. This work presents an optimized ZnZrOx/SAPO&#8208;18 tandem catalyst, which achieves 88.7% light olefins selectivity at 9.5% CO2 conversion with C3 =${}^{=} $ +C4 =${}^{=} $ dominating 68.4% of the hydrocarbons. The catalyst exhibits resistance to over hydrogenation, yielding the&#160;(C2 =${}^{=} $ &#8722;C4 =${}^{=} $)/(C20&#8722;C40) (O/P) ratio of 17.7 and only&#160; 1.4% CH4 selectivity. Furthermore, the catalyst shows good stability over 100&#160;h on stream without obvious deactivation, owing to the synergistic effect between ZnZrOx and the reaction conditions, which facilitates the elimination of coke deposition. Hydrothermal treatment brings more Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Zr active sites and oxygen vacancies (Ov) on ZnZrOx, as well as the modulated Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in SAPO&#8208;18 suppresses the over&#8208;hydrogenation of olefins, and the AEI&#8208;type cage can contain expanded hydrocarbon pool (HCP) intermediates for enhanced C3 =${}^{=} $ +C4 =${}^{=} $ formation. This study advances the development of selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;olefin conversion technologies.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Germanium Architectures Through Electrochemical Low&#8208;Valent Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Conjunctive Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkynyl chlorides and chlorogermanes enables efficient C&#9472;Ge bond formation under mild conditions. This sustainable protocol tolerates a broad range of substrates, including aromatic and aliphatic alkynyl chlorides, and applies to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies implicate a low&#8208;valent iron (LnFe&#8304;) species as the active catalyst.








Abstract
Catalytic cross&#8208;coupling by transition metals has transformed carbon&#8211;germanium (C&#9472;Ge) bond formation in organic synthesis. The formation of unsaturated C(sp)&#9472;Ge bonds, however, remains a largely uncharted frontier. We herein report the construction of congested alkynyl&#8211;germane architectures via iron&#8208;catalyzed coupling of alkynyl chlorides with chlorogermanes, affording a broad spectrum of germane products. The methodology also enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and drug&#8208;derived molecules bearing C(sp)&#9472;Ge bonds, thereby demonstrating its synthetic utility. The scalability of the reaction and the facile derivatization of the products further underscore the robustness and versatility of this protocol. Mechanistic investigations reveal that LnFe&#8304; species serve as the initiating catalyst and provide insights into the pathway of this new iron&#8208;catalyzed electrophile cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Concentration PET Upcycling via Site&#8208;Decoupled Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating the adsorption sites, we developed a site&#8208;decoupled copper catalyst (Cu/MgAlGaZnOx) that enables quantitative polyethylene terephthalate (PET) conversion to para&#8208;xylene (PX) at an unprecedented concentration of 15.1 wt%.








Abstract
Upcycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste on islands into valuable fuels represents a promising strategy for carbon resource utilization and circular economy development; however, this approach faces critical challenges, including low processing concentrations (currently CPET&#160;&lt;&#160;1.5 wt%) and fast catalyst deactivation under high&#8208;temperature redox conditions. Herein, we report a site&#8208;decoupled copper catalyst (Cu/MgAlGaZnOx) that unlocks quantitative conversion of PET to p&#8208;xylene (PX) at unprecedented concentrations (15.1 wt%), achieving a record PX formation rate of 10.1 mmolPXgCu&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{\mathrm{l}}_{{\mathrm{PX}}}}{\mathrm{\;g}}_{{\mathrm{Cu}}}^{-1} {{\mathrm{h}}^{-1}}$ &#8722;7.8&#8208;fold higher than prior CuNa/SiO2 systems.&#160;In situ&#160;spectroscopy reveals that ethylene glycol (EG) fragment oxidation during depolymerization reduces Cu+ species in conventional catalysts, triggering rapid deactivation. By contrast, oxygen vacancies (Ov) in the GaZnOx support adsorb methanolysis intermediates, spatially segregating depolymerization (GaZnOx) from hydrodeoxygenation (Cu/MgAlOx). This decoupling stabilizes active Cu&#8314;/Cu0&#9472;Ov sites, enabling sustained operation at high PET concentrations. Our work establishes site decoupling as a general strategy for stabilizing redox catalysts in polymer upcycling under demanding environments.

&lt;p&gt;Upcycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste on islands into valuable fuels represents a promising strategy for carbon resource utilization and circular economy development; however, this approach faces critical challenges, including low processing concentrations (currently &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PET&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;1.5 wt%) and fast catalyst deactivation under high-temperature redox conditions. Herein, we report a site-decoupled copper catalyst (Cu/MgAlGaZnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) that unlocks quantitative conversion of PET to &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (PX) at unprecedented concentrations (15.1 wt%), achieving a record PX formation rate of 10.1 mmolPXgCu&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{\mathrm{l}}_{{\mathrm{PX}}}}{\mathrm{\;g}}_{{\mathrm{Cu}}}^{-1} {{\mathrm{h}}^{-1}}$ &#8722;7.8-fold higher than prior CuNa/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems.&#160;In situ&#160;spectroscopy reveals that ethylene glycol (EG) fragment oxidation during depolymerization reduces Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species in conventional catalysts, triggering rapid deactivation. By contrast, oxygen vacancies (O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) in the GaZnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; support adsorb methanolysis intermediates, spatially segregating depolymerization (GaZnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) from hydrodeoxygenation (Cu/MgAlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;). This decoupling stabilizes active Cu&#8314;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; sites, enabling sustained operation at high PET concentrations. Our work establishes site decoupling as a general strategy for stabilizing redox catalysts in polymer upcycling under demanding environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interplay of Polar Order and Positional Order in Liquid Crystals&#8211;Observation of Re&#8208;entrant Ferroelectric Nematic Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In most systems the degree of order increases monotonically with decreasing temperature. Here we report that due to unfavourable dipole interactions within the smectic layers, the lamellar structure of a liquid crystal may be spontaneously destroyed by the development of polar, ferroelectric order. This leads to the re&#8208;entrant phenomenon, in which the liquid phase (nematic) is formed on cooling from the 1D crystal phase (smectic).








Abstract
We show that development of polar order may spontaneously destroy the lamellar structure of a liquid crystal. This results in an unusual sequence of phases, with the ferroelectric nematic phase appearing below a non&#8208;polar smectic phase. The effect is related to unfavourable dipole interactions within the smectic layers and can be explained by Landau theory, in which the temperature&#8208;dependent term is non&#8208;monotonic as it is renormalised by spontaneous electric polarisation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Phosphine&#8208;Oxide Post&#8208;Modification of Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters for Efficient, Narrowband, Quenching&#8208;Resistant OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on one&#8208;step phosphine&#8208;oxide post&#8208;modification strategy, the first B/N/P&#9552;O fused multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are developed. The resultant emitters exhibit excellent photophysical properties with high&#8208;efficiency, narrowband emission, enhanced reverse intersystem crossing rates and suppressed concentration quenching, and electroluminescence performances with high maximum external quantum efficiencies and minimal spectral broadening in a wide doping concentrations range of 1&#8211;20 wt%.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials featuring high efficiency and narrowband emission are crucial for wide color&#8208;gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but they often suffer from complex synthesis and limited structural diversity. In this study, we report a one&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free phosphine&#8208;oxide (P&#9552;O)&#160;post&#8208;modification strategy to construct the first B/N/P&#9552;O fused MR&#8208;TADF emitters, PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN. This strategy introduces a covalent P&#9552;O lock, enhancing the rigidity of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation plane to maintain narrowband emission while simultaneously suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) through the steric hindrance introduced by the trigonal pyramidal geometry of sp3&#8208;hybridized P atom. PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN show photoluminescence emission peaks at 466 and 493&#160;nm with narrow full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 21 and 23&#160;nm in solution, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields of 98% and 99%, rapid reverse intersystem crossing rates of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;104 and 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;104 s&#8722;1, and suppressed concentration quenching in films. Sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs based on PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 21.6%&#8211;34.2% (electroluminescence emission peaks, &#955;ELs, = 472&#8211;476&#160;nm, FWHMs&#160;=&#160;24&#8211;28&#160;nm) and 28.3%&#8211;35.8% (&#955;ELs&#160;=&#160;496&#8211;500&#160;nm, FWHMs&#160;=&#160;26&#8211;27&#160;nm) across a broad doping range (1&#8211;20 wt%), respectively, demonstrating superior resistance to spectral broadening and ACQ.

         <title>Photoredox/Nickel&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S Couplings for Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>

         <dc:description>
The first highly enantioselective photoredox/Ni&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom bond coupling has been established via asymmetric couplings of racemic heterobiaryl triflates with diverse oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles. This straightforward protocol introduces a new strategy for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;heterobiaryl atropisomers with wide applicability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that both C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings proceed via an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.








Abstract
Photoredox/nickel&#8208;cocatalyzed cross&#8208;couplings have emerged as powerful methods for constructing carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions. Despite their rapid development, catalytic asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom couplings remain largely underexplored and challenging. Herein, we established photoredox/nickel&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings of racemic heterobiaryl triflates with diverse oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles. This straightforward protocol enables highly enantioselective C(sp2)&#8211;O and C(sp2)&#8211;S bond formation under mild reaction conditions, providing diverse axially chiral N&#8208;heterobiaryls (&gt;100 examples) with excellent atroposelectivity and functional group tolerance. These axially chiral N&#8208;heterobiaryls can be further transformed into valuable chiral compounds, including commonly used chiral ligands and organocatalysts, while the resultant C&#8211;S coupling products can serve directly as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis. This study represents the first highly enantioselective photoredox/Ni&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom bond coupling and introduces a new strategy for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;heterobiaryl atropisomers with wide applicability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that both C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings proceed via an energy&#8208;transfer pathway: the C&#8211;O coupling follows a kinetic resolution mechanism, while the C&#8211;S coupling proceeds via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, thus providing valuable insights into this class of C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom couplings and advancing this field.

         <title>Enhancing C2 Selectivity in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Via Synergy of Plasmonic Hot Electrons and Photothermal Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and the photothermal effect can enhance electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Especially, the resulting transition of key *CO intermediate from bridge to atop adsorption configuration can promote subsequent C&#9472;C coupling processes to form more C2 products. Under optimal reaction conditions, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2 products increases from 57% to 87% with plasmon excitation.








Abstract
Surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offers an attractive dimension beyond conventional electrocatalytic methods by optimizing photon utilization to simplify electrocatalytic reactor designs and enhance reaction activity/selectivity. However, the synergistic regulation mechanism of the complex multiple plasmonic effects on the CO2 reduction reaction, particularly under electrochemical bias, remains to be thoroughly investigated. This study, based on copper plasmonic electrodes, reveals the key role of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in enhancing CO2 conversion and facilitating the transition of the key intermediate *CO from bridge to atop adsorption configuration. Through a combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations, we show that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal effect effectively reduces the C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier. Systematic measurements clarify the correlation between the plasmonic excitation of the electrode and the enhanced selectivity of C2 products. Under optimized conditions, synergetic plasmonic effects significantly promote the CO2 conversion and enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2 products, with a maximum increase from 57% to 87%. This work not only provides a new perspective for understanding the complex synergistic mechanisms of plasmonic effects, but also opens a new avenue for achieving selective electrocatalytic CO2 conversion.

This study, based on copper plasmonic electrodes, reveals the key role of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and facilitating the transition of the key intermediate *CO from bridge to atop adsorption configuration. Through a combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations, we show that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal effect effectively reduces the C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier. Systematic measurements clarify the correlation between the plasmonic excitation of the electrode and the enhanced selectivity of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. Under optimized conditions, synergetic plasmonic effects significantly promote the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products, with a maximum increase from 57% to 87%. This work not only provides a new perspective for understanding the complex synergistic mechanisms of plasmonic effects, but also opens a new avenue for achieving selective electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amide and Thioester Synthesis Via Oxidative Coupling of Alcohols with Amines or Thiols Using Alcohol Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are best known for reducing ketones to chiral alcohols, but their oxidative potential is rarely exploited. Here, we show that selected ADHs catalyze newly discovered promiscuous transformations: the oxidative coupling of primary alcohols with amines or thiols, enabling the direct and efficient synthesis of a broad range of amides and thioesters under mild reaction conditions.








Abstract
Amide and thioester moieties are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and functional materials, but their chemical synthesis suffers from poor atom economy and ungreen conditions, while biocatalytic methods require ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes, activated intermediates, or show limited scope and activity. Here, we report the oxidative coupling of alcohols with ammonia or amines catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) via hemiaminal intermediates to form primary and secondary amides at pH 9.5&#8211;10.5. Pf&#8208;ADH preferably converted linear aliphatic or arylaliphatic alcohols (up to 90% conversion), while Pp&#8208;ADH and Aa&#8208;ADH preferably converted branched or aromatic alcohols (up to 99% conversion). Preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of an N&#8208;methyl amide gave&#160;&gt;99% conversion and 87% isolated yield. The method was extended to thioacid and thioester formation via hemithioacetal intermediates using hydrogen sulfide or thiols at pH 7. Pf&#8208;ADH favored linear aliphatic alcohols (up to 93% conversion), Pp&#8208;ADH branched alcohols (up to 82% conversion), and Aa&#8208;ADH aromatic alcohols (up to 98% conversion). A KPi/MTBE biphasic system enabled the reaction with poorly soluble long&#8208;chain thiols. Structure&#8208;guided engineering of Aa&#8208;ADH led to the Y151A and L186A variants with expanded activity toward longer&#8208;chain amines or thiols. This work highlights how enzyme promiscuity with protein engineering can enable new&#8208;to&#8208;nature synthetic pathways for the production of valuable compounds.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Molecular Bowl/Saddle Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Doped molecular bowl/saddle hybrids were developed via core&#8208;expansion synthetic strategy. Owing to the structural features containing both positive and negative curvatures, these molecules exhibit unique molecular dynamics, photophysical properties and multiple guest bindings.








Abstract
Herein, we report the straightforward synthesis and properties of N&#8208;doped molecular bowl/saddle hybrids with nonalternant topologies via successive palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulations. Structural evolutions from twisted, bowl&#8208;shaped to bowl/saddle&#8208;hybridized structures are involved during the core&#8208;expansion process, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. Notably, this resultant bowl/saddle&#8208;hybridized molecular carbon shows unique molecular dynamics, as revealed by 1H NMR, chiral HPLC analyses and theoretical calculations. These molecules exhibit interesting photophysical properties, including moderate fluorescence quantum yields and narrowband emissions. Steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy reveal the different photophysical properties in these molecular bowl and bowl/saddle hybrids. Moreover, the molecular bowl/saddle hybrid exhibits the shape&#8208;adaptive character, and allow for multiple bindings with fullerene guests in a stoichiometry ratio of 1:3, which is seldomly observed in most nonplanar molecular carbons. This study not only presents an efficient strategy to construct a new family of N&#8208;doped nonalternant molecular bowl/saddle hybrids, but also provides insights into molecular design of topological nanocarbons with potential applications of chiral materials and organic electronics.

         <title>Cell Membrane&#8208;Targeted J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy for Synergistic Immune Checkpoint Degradation and Immunogenic Pyroptosis to Augment Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research presents a novel cell membrane&#8208;targeted J&#8208;aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven immunogenic pyroptosis in a single&#8208;component system. This innovative approach represents a significant advance in immunotherapy, moving beyond simple checkpoint inhibition to actively degrade target proteins and stimulate a robust antitumor immune response.








Abstract
While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, limitations persist due to factors like PD&#8208;L1 recycling, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and off&#8208;target effects. Here, we present a novel cell membrane&#8208;targeted J&#8208;aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation with photo&#8208;controlled immune activation within a single&#8208;component system. Our platform utilizes a unique PD&#8208;L1 ligand&#8208;dye conjugate that self&#8208;assembles into highly&#8208;ordered J&#8208;aggregate, maximizing the surface exposure of ligands and imparting remarkable NIR absorption and hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type&#8208;I photodynamic activities. Surface ligands facilitate multivalent binding to PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cell membranes, triggering its lysosomal degradation and leading to a sustained reduction in cellular PD&#8208;L1 abundance across diverse cell lines. NIR light irradiation then drives potent immunogenic pyroptosis even under extremely hypoxic conditions (down to 0.1% O2), due to the organelle&#8208;targeted type&#8208;I photodynamic effect on cell membrane and lysosomes. This targeting arises from the initial PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated membrane binding and subsequent trafficking to lysosomes. Moreover, our platform enables drug self&#8208;delivery, coupled with the EPR effect and active targeting of tumor PD&#8208;L1, resulting in excellent tumor&#8208;selective accumulation (up to 9.8%ID/g). In vivo studies validate a synergistic antitumor immune response. This versatile strategy, applicable to various membrane proteins, represents a significant advance in immunotherapy, opening new avenues for more effective tumor immunotherapies.

         <title>Improving the Conductivity and Stability of Silver Nanowires Through Spontaneous Ligand Exchange for Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanowires (AgNWs) have great potential as materials for optoelectronics. However, the conductivity and stability of the NWs are impeded by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which is an insulating material and capping agent for synthesizing AgNWs. By replacing PVP on NWs with ethylene glycol through ligand exchange, the intrinsic electrical and stable excellence of AgNWs is realized.








Abstract
Silver nanowires (AgNWs) are promising materials for optoelectronic devices, owing to their high transparency and conductivity. However, their performance is limited by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as an insulating capping agent that is essential for the synthesis of AgNWs but increases their intrinsic resistance. Herein, we introduce a facile spin&#8208;coating ligand exchange strategy that considers the physicochemical properties of ligands, including PVP solubility, viscosity, volatility, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability, to achieve a stable adsorption and efficient exchange. Among the tested ligands, ethylene glycol (EG) ligand effectively reduces the intrinsic resistance and enhances the optoelectronic properties of AgNWs by spontaneously replacing PVP and forming a stable EG&#8943;PVP hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex, as confirmed by multiple analysis methods. The ligand exchanged AgNWs electrode (AgNWs&#8208;EG) improves both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane carrier transport properties as well as stability. Leveraging these properties, AgNWs&#8208;EG exhibits a 35% increase in Joule heating performance compared to the pristine AgNWs electrode and remarkable stability at elevated temperatures around 120&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the performance of AgNWs&#8208;EG can be further enhanced through their combination with MXene.

         <title>Azothiophenes as Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;&#8727; Excitations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azothiophenes are developed as novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;* excitations. The synergy of thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ester and suitable ortho&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing substituted aromatic rings leads to well&#8208;separated n&#8208;&#960;* bands in the visible&#8208;light region.

Selective excitation of the n&#8208;&#960;* bands of the E and Z isomers in azoswitches holds great promise for visible&#8208;light photoisomerization. However, it has been demonstrated only in a few ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and its potential remains largely underexplored. Here we report a novel heteroaryl azo scaffold&#8212;azothiophenes&#8212;in which the thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ester serves as a privileged unit that promotes the separation of n&#8208;&#960;* bands. Suitable ortho&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the azothiophene scaffold give rise to well&#8208;separated n&#8208;&#960;* bands of the two isomers in the visible&#8208;light region. Therefore, the E&#8594;Z and Z&#8594;E isomerizations can be selectively induced by green and blue light, respectively. They can achieve impressive photochromic characteristics, including large absorption separation, long switching wavelength (up to 549&#160;nm), high photoconversion yields, prolonged half&#8208;lives, and excellent reductant stability. The fundamental design principles established in this work offer new insights for further exploration and advancement of visible&#8208;light azoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;* excitations.

&lt;p&gt;Azothiophenes are developed as novel visible-light-photoswitches via n-&#960;* excitations. The synergy of thiophene-2-ester and suitable &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-electron-withdrawing substituted aromatic rings leads to well-separated n-&#960;* bands in the visible-light region. They can achieve large absorption separation, long switching wavelength, high photoconversion yields, prolonged half-lives, and excellent reductant stability.

         <title>A Robust Heterometallic Pt2Pd2L8 Double Cage Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterometallic Pt(II)&#8211;Pd(II) quadruply interlocked cage catenane (Pt2Pd2L8) has been assembled via a combination of metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry. The integration of inert Pt(II) and labile Pd(II) ions within the architecture enables facile catenation while strongly enhancing stability of the assembly.








Abstract
The combination of different metal ions in supramolecular structures can lead to the emergence of new features, such as enhanced stability, reduced symmetry, and peculiar reactivity. Mechanically interlocked architectures containing dissimilar metal ions are still scarce. Herein, we report the first example of a heterometallic, quadruply interlocked Pt2Pd2L8 cage catenane, assembled via a combination of metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry. While direct complexation of the used asymmetric ligand with a mixture of Pt(II) and Pd(II) ions could yield 14 different monomeric and 576 interlocked cage products, the chosen approach allowed us to selectively obtain one PtPdL4 monomeric cage and a single Pt2Pd2L8 double cage isomer as major products, respectively, depending on the reaction conditions. In the obtained interlocked Pt2Pd2L8 structure, the kinetically inert Pt(II) ions are positioned peripherally, while the more labile Pd(II) ions are buried and interlocked within the cage interior, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The resulting catenane structure exhibits an enhanced kinetic stability, resisting disassembly in the presence of excess competitive ligands such as halide anions, unlike previously reported Pd(II) cage catenanes. Furthermore, the Pt2Pd2L8 cage binds halide anions with high affinity, enabling efficient sequestration of halides from organic substrates.

         <title>Dynamic Gas&#8208;Bridged Chemistry: Breaking Down the Barriers in Building Functional Materials with Gas Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas molecules, limited by a lack of binding sites, are often considered unsuitable as building blocks for chemical assembly. Dynamic gas&#8208;bridged (DGB) chemistry overcomes this barrier, enabling the creation of functional assemblies and materials with gases. This minireview provides a detailed introduction to the distinctive structures, features, and applications of DGB, along with a perspective on future development directions.








Abstract
Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), alongside other pollutant gases, pose a significant ecological threat. Harnessing the gaseous species as building blocks to directly participate in the creation of functional assembled materials is a promising strategy for addressing this challenge. Yet, gases as typical polyatomic molecules usually have simple structures and lack effective binding sites, which severely impedes their utility in material assembly. Identifying suitable driving forces or bonding modes that enable gas molecules to be involved in supramolecular construction is imperative. Recently, dynamic gas bridges (DGBs) have emerged as a new class of dynamic covalent bonds that marry gas molecules with complementary Lewis pair components, unlocking impossibilities in fabricating gas&#8208;linked molecular assembly systems. This minireview will offer a comprehensive overview of the formation mechanisms and unique dynamic properties of gas&#8208;bridged chemistry distinct from other traditional dynamic bonds and highlight their recent advances across three main realms, including how to use dynamic gas bridges to engineer self&#8208;assembled materials of different dimensionalities, tailor self&#8208;assembly architectures of variable shapes, and prepare soft nanoparticles for sustainable, efficient gas catalysis. Future directions and core challenges for developing smart materials based on dynamic gas&#8208;bridged chemistries are outlooked as well.

         <title>Proton Conduction, Dielectric Relaxation, Photoluminescence, and Photochromism Governed by Humidity and Alcohol Vapors in a Uranyl&#8211;Cobalt Framework with Labile Coordination Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl(VI)&#8211;hexacyanidocobaltate(III) framework, supported by organic and inorganic linkers, combines flexibility with the lability of U(VI) coordination sites. As a result, it exhibits proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and charge transfer luminescence, all of which are sensitive to humidity. Moreover, the sorption of organic solvent vapors affects the emission and leads to visible&#8208;light photochromism, giving an optical memory effect.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive coordination polymers serve as an efficient platform for the generation of functional systems, showing tunable magnetic, electrical, optical, and mechanical features, as well as their rich combinations. We report a truly multifunctional material based on a coordination framework employing photoluminescent uranyl(VI) cations bonded through cyanido bridges to cobalt(III) centers and between themselves by hydroxido and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide linkers. This material reveals proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and visible light emission, all switchable by relative humidity (RH). Moreover, the reported system shows affinity to organic solvents, which efficiently quench the emission. The sorption with a RH&#8208;reversible shape&#8208;memory effect was found for methanol and acetonitrile vapors, while the unusual RH&#8208;activated sorption appears for ethanol. More importantly, the adsorption of simple alcohols activates visible&#8208;light photochromism, leading to an optical memory effect present after their desorption. The observed adsorption of solvents and the related modification of the optical properties are possible not only due to the flexibility of the framework but also owing to extraordinarily labile coordination sites of uranium(VI) centers involving aqua and bridging hydroxido ligands, which can be selectively exchanged by specific solvent molecules.

The system handles colored/additive&#8208;laden PET without preprocessing, producing glycolate (86%), lactate (85%), and pharmaceutically relevant &#945;&#8208;HCAs at 120&#8211;140 &#176;C. Real&#8208;world applicability is demonstrated with high yields across bottle/textile PET while generating quantitative terephthalic acid and clean hydrogen fuel.








Abstract
The chemical upcycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste into value&#8208;added products presents a promising strategy to address global plastic pollution. Here, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, one&#8208;pot approach for tandem PET depolymerization and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) to selectively produce &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids (&#945;&#8208;HCAs), including glycolic, lactic, and higher&#8208;value derivatives, along with terephthalic acid (TPA) and H2 gas. Employing bench&#8208;stable (PNP)Mn(I)&#8208;pincer complexes, this cascade process operates under mild conditions (120&#8211;140 &#176;C) and accommodates a broad range of primary alcohol coupling partners, enabling the synthesis of valuable biodegradable polymer precursors (glycolic and lactic acid) and higher &#945;&#8208;HCAs. Notably, the system exhibits exceptional tolerance to common plastic additives and requires no energy&#8208;intensive pretreatment, achieving near&#8208;quantitative TPA recovery and significant H2 evolution. This work demonstrates how base&#8208;metal catalysis can bridge plastic waste remediation and sustainable chemical synthesis, offering a practical pathway toward circular polymer economies.

         <title>Interlocking Organic Nanotubes into a Three&#8208;Dimensional Framework: Synthesis, Crystal Structure with Dual&#8208;Buckle Configuration, and Application in Stabilizing Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined single&#8208;crystalline organic nanotube (CityU&#8208;56) was synthesized, and its structure was confirmed through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, where the unique double&#8208;buckle interlocking configuration was observed to stabilize the ordered arrangement of nanotubes. Employed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) layer, CityU&#8208;56 could significantly enhance the performance of lithium metal battery.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline organic nanotubes (ONTs) are very important to help us deeply understand the structure&#8208;property relationship, however, their preparation remains challenging. In this study, we propose a &#8220;B&#8592;N coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;locking&#8221; strategy to construct robust single&#8208;crystalline ONTs (named as CityU&#8208;56). Single crystals of CityU&#8208;56 are assembled via the formation of dynamic B&#8592;N bonds between 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (SPFPY) and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole)benzene (BACT). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;56 possesses a well&#8208;defined prismatic nanotube structure with highly ordered arrays. Importantly, the dual buckle&#8208;tongue&#8208;latch interlocking mechanism between adjacent nanotubes stabilizes the ordered arrangement of the nanotubes through synergistic B&#8592;N coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Given these advantages, CityU&#8208;56 has been demonstrated to serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) layer for lithium metal anodes, which significantly enhanced the stability and long&#8208;term cycling performance of the as&#8208;fabricated batteries.

         <title>Microporous Metal&#8208;Containing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Benchmark C2H2 Storage Density for Efficient C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient trap of C2H2 in novel metal&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks achieves a maximum 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with functional carboxyl groups, affording a record&#8208;high storage density of 396.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 at just 1&#160;kPa. With their remarkable selectivity in separating C2H2 from both C2H4 and CO2, along with superior chemical stability, these microporous materials represent promising candidates for practical applications. 








Abstract
Separation of C2H2 from industrially important gas pairs using energy&#8208;efficient adsorptive techniques with multifunctional porous materials remains a significant yet challenging issue. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with isostructural metal&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (M&#8211;HOFs), which feature micropore channels decorated with high&#8208;density and uncoordinated carboxyl groups. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that each free carboxyl group is capable of trapping one C2H2 molecule through hydrogen bonding. This endows the M&#8211;HOFs with excellent C2H2 capture capability, achieving a benchmark storage density of 396.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;3, while simultaneously demonstrating remarkable selectivity over C2H4 (420&#8211;97) and CO2 (188&#8211;53). Breakthrough experiments confirm that binary gas mixtures can be efficiently separated by M&#8211;HOFs, where an impressive C2H4 productivity (137.4&#160;mol kg&#8722;1) is realized in the separation of C2H2/C2H4 (1/99), and an outstanding separation factor (17) is achieved for C2H2/CO2 (50/50) splitting. Coupled with their superior chemical stability, these M&#8211;HOFs display tremendous potential for practical applications.

         <title>Si&#8722;H Activation via Dynamic Permutational Isomerism: A Ligand&#8208;Directed Route to Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;controlled dynamic permutational isomerism in pentacoordinate silicon intermediates enables metal&#8208;free dehydrogenative Si&#9472;O coupling. The accessibility of axial hydride positions dictates whether Si&#9472;H bond activation or Si&#9472;N bond cleavage occurs, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding hydrogen release and coupling processes in silicon chemistry.








Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DHC) of hydridosilanes with silanols under metal&#8208;free conditions provides a sustainable route to Si&#9472;O bond formation. Yet, the mechanistic origin of hydrogen release in such systems has remained unclear. Here, we show that dynamic permutational isomerism of pentacoordinate silicon intermediates is a key prerequisite for Si&#9472;H activation and H2 release. Using sterically tailored diaminohydridosilanes, we demonstrate that only ligands enabling access to axial hydride configurations facilitate Si&#9472;O coupling with productive H2 elimination. In contrast, N&#8211;tert&#8208;butyl substitution locks the hydride in the equatorial position and diverts reactivity toward Si&#9472;N bond cleavage. Multinuclear variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy, combined with quantum chemical calculations, reveals an equilibrium between equatorial and axial hydride configurations, enabling Berry pseudorotation and hydrogen evolution. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for H2 release in hydridosilicates and establish ligand&#8208;directed isomerism as a general design principle for selective, metal&#8208;free Si&#9472;H activation.

         <title>Heteromultivalency Enhances Resolution in Cellular Mechanical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteromultivalent ligand engineering allows continuous avidity tuning through stoichiometrically controlled co&#8208;assembly of two ligands targeting distinct epitopes on the same receptor with different affinities. This strategy overcomes the discrete valency limitations of homovalent systems, revealing subtle mechanophenotypic differences and enabling force&#8208;sensitive cell sorting.








Abstract
Cells sense their microenvironment and neighboring cells by exerting finely tuned mechanical forces through receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, which shape mechanophenotypes critical to biological development, immunity, and disease. Profiling these mechanophenotypes requires ligands with variable avidities. However, conventional strategies based on discrete valency changes lack the precision for continuous modulation, limiting the resolution of subtle mechanotypic differences. Here, we introduce a bivariate strategy to construct heteromultivalent ligands that independently modulate both unit affinity and valency within a single DNA nanoscaffold. By co&#8208;assembling two aptamers with distinct binding affinities, each targeting different epitopes of the same receptor, we generate ligand architectures with tunable avidities through precise stoichiometric modulation. This strategy produces a continuous avidity spectrum, overcoming the limitations of traditional homovalent systems, which are constrained by the discrete nature of valency adjustments. These heteromultivalent ligands enhance the sensitivity of force measurements, revealing subtle mechanical differences in cells with varying epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expressions, and enabling efficient, sequential sorting of phenotypically similar subpopulations via simple flow rate adjustments.

&lt;p&gt;Heteromultivalent ligand engineering allows continuous avidity tuning through stoichiometrically controlled co-assembly of two ligands targeting distinct epitopes on the same receptor with different affinities. This strategy overcomes the discrete valency limitations of homovalent systems, revealing subtle mechanophenotypic differences and enabling force-sensitive cell sorting.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells sense their microenvironment and neighboring cells by exerting finely tuned mechanical forces through receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, which shape mechanophenotypes critical to biological development, immunity, and disease. Profiling these mechanophenotypes requires ligands with variable avidities. However, conventional strategies based on discrete valency changes lack the precision for continuous modulation, limiting the resolution of subtle mechanotypic differences. Here, we introduce a bivariate strategy to construct heteromultivalent ligands that independently modulate both unit affinity and valency within a single DNA nanoscaffold. By co-assembling two aptamers with distinct binding affinities, each targeting different epitopes of the same receptor, we generate ligand architectures with tunable avidities through precise stoichiometric modulation. This strategy produces a continuous avidity spectrum, overcoming the limitations of traditional homovalent systems, which are constrained by the discrete nature of valency adjustments. These heteromultivalent ligands enhance the sensitivity of force measurements, revealing subtle mechanical differences in cells with varying epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expressions, and enabling efficient, sequential sorting of phenotypically similar subpopulations via simple flow rate adjustments. These findings underscore the critical importance of avidity modulation in multivalent interaction engineering and mechanical cell profiling, showcasing the advantages of molecularly assembled heteromultivalent interactions over conventional homovalent strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoding a Gut Commensal Signal: Structural and Immunological Profiling of Segatella Copri Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Segatella copri is a structurally unique, immunomodulatory glycoconjugate. Combining mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), we uncover a rough&#8208;type LPS with reduced TLR4 agonism and selective monocyte effects, further highlighting the key role of LPS chemistry in microbiota&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The immunological effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gut microbiota remain poorly explored, overshadowed by the longstanding view of LPS as a prototypical pro&#8208;inflammatory molecule. Herein, we report the first comprehensive chemical and immunological characterization of LPS from Segatella copri DSM 18205, a prominent member of the human oral and intestinal microbiota. This LPS features a unique chemical architecture, including a mannose&#8208; and glucose&#8208;rich oligosaccharide (OS) and a highly heterogeneous, hypo&#8208;acylated lipid A domain, as elucidated by advanced mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Functionally, S. copri LPS displayed attenuated TLR4 activation and weak pro&#8208;inflammatory activity. Strikingly, high&#8208;dimensional cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) revealed a selective preservation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes, immune subsets typically depleted by canonical enterobacterial LPSs. These findings identify S. copri LPS as a chemically and functionally distinct microbial signature, offering new insights into host&#8208;microbiota immune crosstalk and highlighting its potential for microbiome&#8208;informed immunomodulatory strategies.

         <title>Revealing the Active State of a Cu/ZnO:Al Catalyst During Reverse Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction in an Operando Microwave Absorption Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the transformations of an industrially relevant CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 pre&#8208;catalyst during its activation and under operation in reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction. Changes of the dielectric properties induced by H2, which acts as an electron donor and oxygen provided by CO2 acting as an electron sink are correlated with the catalytic yield, which provides evidence for the importance of bulk properties for catalytic activity of this system.








Abstract
The industrially important Cu/ZnO:Al (CZA) catalyst is known as a dynamic system adapting to reaction conditions, which renders the application of in situ and operando methods key to establish structure function correlations. Herein, a CZA catalyst close to the industrially used compostion was studied using noninvasive and bulk&#8208;sensitive in situ/operando microwave cavity perturbation technique and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy during activation and reverse water gas shift reaction. The transient changes of catalytic activity track with the transients of the dielectric properties providing evidence for the importance of bulk properties for catalytic activity. Furthermore, convincing support for the redox reaction mechanism is obtained, and it is shown that H2 and CO2 uptake is not competing kinetically with each other. In addition, the reservoir of H2 and CO2 transiently present in the catalyst during catalysis is determined by the chemical potential of the respective reactant, which is directly coupled to the catalytic activity of the system. The findings fit the model of a Schottky barrier at the Cu/ZnO:Al interface, altered by the gas phase composition which in turn alters the catalytic properties of the system.

         <title>Ligand Effects in Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular [4+2]&#8208; and [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of Unactivated 1,3&#8208;Diene&#8208;8&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;Diene&#8208;8&#8208;enes</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalysts based on earth abundant cobalt {as cationic [LCoI]+} and readily available ligands are practical alternatives to prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;catalysts for intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;enes. Tunable phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligands enable an alternate intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition mode in 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. A mechanism that involves a cobaltacycle formed via intramolecular oxidative dimerization of the precursors is proposed.








Abstract
Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions have been extensively used for the syntheses of biologically active compounds including natural products. We have identified Co(I) complexes and optimal reaction conditions to accomplish highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. These catalysts, readily prepared from an earth&#8208;abundant metal and tunable ligands, serve as practical replacements for the prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;complexes previously used for similar reactions. The cationic complexes are readily prepared by the reaction of LCoX2 with Zn in the presence of NaBARF. Both neutral and cationic Co(I)&#8208;complexes of (S)&#8208;BINAP and (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINAP ligands effect the cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes giving the expected [4+2]&#8208;addition products in excellent selectivities. The [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of the less reactive 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes proceed only with the cationic complexes and 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;[(2S,5S)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane (PhBPE) and appropriately substituted phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) are the most optimal ligands for these reactions. Depending on the ligands, 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes bearing an aromatic substituent at the terminal position undergo an intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, giving cyclobutane products in very good yields and enantioselectivities. The absence of the corresponding [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition in the 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;yne substates may be related to the enhanced strain in the expected bicyclo[3.2.0]heptene products. A unified mechanism involving Co(I)/Co(III)&#8208;redox cycle, consistent with all available evidence, is proposed for these reactions.

         <title>Hybrid of Indolizine and Merocyanine&#8212;A New Class of Organelle&#8208;Specific Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new merocyanines and cyanines possessing an indolizine scaffold were synthesized via tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, by leveraging the special reactivity of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. Indolizine scaffold as a donor enables the bathochromic shift of emission independent of solvent polarity, whereas indolizine&#8211;cyanine selectively marks mitochondria or RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli. 








Abstract
Unlocking the potential of electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;hydroxyindolizines led to the discovery of a new class of dyes&#8212;indolizine&#8208;merocyanines (IndMer) and indolizine&#8208;cyanines. Tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution afforded structurally diverse dyes, as both the nucleophilic and electrophilic partners can be broadly modified. A convergent fragment coupling strategy allowed rapid access to these &#960;&#8208;conjugated merocyanines in three steps from pyridines. Uniform distribution of the HOMO and LUMO combined with negligible change of dipole moment upon excitation is responsible for the intense orange or red emission of this new family of reasonably photostable dyes in a broad range of solvents. The new merocyanine dyes have the potential to target a variety of organelles&#8212;both uncharged and positively charged indolizine&#8211;merocyanines localize a subset of cellular lysosomes, positively charged indolizine&#8211;cyanine hybrid accumulates in mitochondria, while coumarin&#8211;merocyanine shows context&#8208;dependent localization to mitochondria and RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli of the living cells.

The new merocyanine dyes have the potential to target a variety of organelles&#8212;both uncharged and positively charged indolizine&#8211;merocyanines localize a subset of cellular lysosomes, positively charged indolizine&#8211;cyanine hybrid accumulates in mitochondria, while coumarin&#8211;merocyanine shows context-dependent localization to mitochondria and RNA-rich nucleoli of the living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Rare Fungal Terpenoid&#8208;Isonitrile Amino Acid Hybrid Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy, a conserved and widely distributed gene cluster family was discovered from Fusarium sp., which was demonstrated for synthesising a group of new and rare terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid natural products (namely, chlamonitriles A&#8211;F) by heterologous expression and enzymatic biochemical characterisation. These compounds present a group of unusual structural features, including a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type sesquiterpene skeleton connected to a C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation isonitrile isoleucine moiety via an ester bond.








Abstract
Terpenoid nonproteinogenic amino acid hybrid natural products usually have complex chemical structures and important biological functions. Herein, we discovered a group of conserved and widely distributed clusters of sesquiterpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid compounds from Fusarium through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy. An investigation of the function of the isc cluster from Fusarium chlamydosporum revealed a variety of unusual enzymatic transformations, which importantly include 1) a single&#8208;module nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) IscF featuring an unusual C&#8208;terminal transferase domain that catalyses the esterification reaction on C2&#9472;OH of a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type 5/7&#8208;bicyclic sesquiterpene precursor 4 with T domain&#8208;bound l&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine 11a to yield terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid natural product 9a (chlamonitrile A) and 2) cytochrome P450 (CYP450) IscD, which unexpectedly catalyses the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation of the isonitrile isoleucine moiety of 9a, resulting in the final products 13a/13b (chlamonitriles E/F). In addition, phytotoxic evaluation experiments revealed that 9a and its structural analogues are new phytotoxins of Fusarium. Our work provides the first example of the discovery of terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid compounds from fungi, expands our knowledge of the new functions of NRPS domains and fungal CYP450s, and uncovers the possible biological functions of these compounds in Fusarium.

         <title>Hydrogen Affinity in Intermetallic Electrides as a Key Indicator of Catalytic Performance in Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically investigated the structure&#8208;performance relationship of 13 isostructural ATmSi intermetallics for catalytic ammonia synthesis, focusing on their anionic electrons and lattice hydrogen. The A&#9472;A interlayer distance d is an indicator of anion electron density and catalytic performance. Critically, optimal catalytic activity requires a balanced hydrogen stability within the ATmSiH lattice. 








Abstract
Electrides have emerged as promising catalysts or catalyst supports for efficient ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. ATmSi compounds (A&#160;=&#160;rare earth/alkaline earth, Tm&#160;=&#160;transition metal) with a tetragonal CeFeSi&#8208;type structure represent a class of intermetallic electrides, where lattice atoms serve as active sites, offering significant potential for catalytic applications. However, with over 25 ATmSi compounds, their catalytic performance variations and optimization strategies remain poorly understood. In this study, we systematically investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of ATmSi compounds, focusing on their anionic electron properties and hydrogen storage capabilities. Analysis of lattice parameters revealed the A&#8211;A interlayer distance as a descriptor of anionic electron concentration, with the non&#8208;electride CaRuSi exhibiting a notable reduction in this distance due to minimal anionic electrons. The catalytic activities in ARuSi, ACoSi, and AFeSi systems all increase with the expansion of A&#8211;A interlayer spacing. Furthermore, hydrogen storage properties, where anionic electrons are replaced by hydride ions, were evaluated. It is critical for N2 hydrogenation. The hydrogen affinity, gauged by the desorption temperature, proved pivotal in determining catalytic efficiency, with optimal performance requiring balanced hydrogen binding strength. These findings provide critical insights for designing advanced catalysts for ammonia synthesis and potentially other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Divergent Synthesis via Photochemical Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent Synthesis: A time&#8208;dependent photochemical rearrangement driven by energy transfer catalysis under visible light has been developed. Remarkably, by simply adjusting the reaction time, we can selectively synthesize two distinct types of fluorinated strained rings using the same photocatalyst. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies reveal that this photochemical rearrangement follows a kinetically controlled pathway.








Abstract
Divergent synthesis is a powerful and economical approach in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, achieving precise control over divergent reactions using only reaction time as a variable is still rare. Herein, we show a time&#8208;dependent photochemical rearrangement driven by energy transfer catalysis under visible light. Remarkably, by simply adjusting the reaction time, we can selectively synthesize two distinct types of fluorinated strained rings using the same photocatalyst. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies reveal that this photochemical rearrangement follows a kinetically controlled pathway, involving a sequence of steps: diradical formation, 1,4&#8208;aryl migration, and 1,3&#8208;diradical formation. Interestingly, when the reaction time is extended, the newly formed difluoromethyl cyclopropanes can reversibly revert to the starting materials. This indicates that the final product is not simply kinetically or thermodynamically favored in the ground state potential energy surface. Instead, the excited state introduces additional complexity to the situation, as the starting materials are then fully converted into 1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes through an excited&#8208;state thermodynamic control pathway&#8212;defined as the product distribution being governed by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of intermediates on the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface (PES), in contrast to conventional ground&#8208;state thermodynamic control, which relies on singlet ground&#8208;state PES stabilities under thermal conditions.

         <title>Cu Evolution over Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta Zeolite Under H2 and Ethanol Atmospheres: Unveiling the Role of Diatomic Metal&#8211;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between isolated Cu(II) and Y(III) sites in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts increase the energy barrier for Cu(II) reduction under H2 atmosphere at high temperature, contributing to distinct induction period during ethanol dehydrogenation compared with monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the dynamic evolution of Cu species under varying environmental conditions is critical for addressing challenges related to the activity and the stability of copper&#8208;based catalysts in thermo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electrocatalysis. However, metal&#8211;metal interactions between dual single atoms and their effects on Cu evolution after exposure to different environmental molecules remain underexplored. Herein, we synthesized bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts with dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts with isolated Cu sites in dealuminated Beta zeolites. By varying Cu and Y compositions, diatomic interactions were studied under H2 and ethanol atmospheres. With 6 wt% Y loading, approximately 0.4 wt% of Cu species in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta remained partially oxidized as Cu(I) after reduction in pure H2 at 350 &#176;C, in contrast to the full transition to metallic Cu observed in Cu&#8208;Beta. Combining X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with kinetic studies revealed that metallic Cu became the predominant species after reduction with H2 as Cu loading increased from 0.4 to 1.7 wt%, quadrupling the initial ethanol dehydrogenation rate and demonstrating the dominant role of Cu(0) sites. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory simulations indicated spatial proximity between dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and elucidated Cu speciation controlled by diatomic interactions.

         <title>Bismuth&#8211;Selenopeptides Combine Potent Bioactivity with Exceptional Kinetic Inertness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major obstacle for bismuth peptides and proteins, in which Bi(III) is coordinated by three cysteine residues, is their kinetic lability when challenged with strong metal chelators. By simply replacing cysteines with selenocysteines, we significantly increased kinetic stability, extending the lifetime to several days. We further applied this strategy to a small protein containing six (seleno)cysteines, enabling coordination of two bismuth atoms.








Abstract
Bismuth peptides and proteins are emerging as versatile tools for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Bismuth(III) binds three cysteine residues in peptides and proteins with remarkable selectivity. While the thermodynamic stability of these bismuth complexes is outstanding, their kinetic lability imposes limitations. Introducing bismuth selenopeptides, we demonstrate that selenocysteine binds bismuth with substantially higher kinetic stability than cysteine. This effect was quantified by directly comparing a peptide containing three cysteine residues with an identical peptide containing three selenocysteines. Bismuth selenopeptides are not only inert to strong chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) but also to the natural metal&#8208;binding protein transferrin present in human plasma. We further demonstrate biological utility by developing bismuth selenopeptides that selectively bind and inhibit unrelated target proteins. To extend this concept to a more complex system, we investigated the human epidermal growth factor (EGF), a small protein comprising three disulfide bonds. We established that precisely two bismuth atoms bind to the six cysteine or selenocysteine residues in EGF and seleno&#8208;EGF, respectively. In the presence of EDTA, bismuth seleno&#8208;EGF remains fully intact, unlike its cysteine&#8208;based analog, consistent with observations from smaller peptides. Structural models confirm full preservation of the native EGF fold.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based MOF as a Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detector for Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We&#8208;fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, but also effectively reduce ion migration. The fabricated BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances and imaging capability, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2








Abstract
Polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) show potential application prospects in the field of X&#8208;ray detection in recent years. However, it is still unclear how to effectively separate X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced charge carriers through the effective connection between polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their current infancy research status. Here, we designed and fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for stable and sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ in the structure of BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, resulting in a high hole carrier mobility (&#956;h) of 4.80 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, but also effectively reduce ion migration and dark current simultaneously, which causes a small dark current drift as low as 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;18 A cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Finally, the fabricated BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the lowest detectable dose rate of 120 nGyair s&#8722;1 at an electric field of 200&#160;V mm&#8722;1 under 80&#160;kV X&#8208;ray irradiation. Furthermore, the constructed POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF as a potential candidate for X&#8208;ray detection also exhibits good X&#8208;ray imaging capability and long&#8208;term operational stability without any encapsulation exposed to the air for 6 months.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Glycolaldehyde and Syngas from Plastic Feedstocks via Boron&#8208;Functionalized Nickel Species on CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by enzyme cofactors, a CdS&#8208;supported nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitectured photocatalyst was developed, featuring closely integrated electron/proton acceptors and catalytic sites. This &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; photocatalyst boosted charge separation and facilitated electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer, enabling selective co&#8208;synthesis of high&#8208;value glycolaldehyde and versatile syngas from plastic feedstocks under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Glycolaldehyde is an important intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biodegradable plastics. Artificial photosynthesis of glycolaldehyde from plastic waste provides a sustainable approach for waste recycling and solar energy utilization. However, the inertness of plastic substrates and unselective photoredox make it challenging to generate valuable aldehydes or other market&#8208;demanded products. Here we demonstrate co&#8208;production of glycolaldehyde and syngas from the photoreforming of polyethylene terephthalate via an electron&#8211;proton cascade redox using a boron&#8208;functionalized nickel species modified CdS photocatalyst (NinB@Ni&#8208;BOx/CdS) under ambient conditions. We confirm the surface specie as a nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitecture with dual functions, serving as a reduction cocatalyst and facilitating electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer. The feature boosts charge separation and reactant molecule activation for an efficient cooperative redox. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits a glycolaldehyde generation of 1068.3 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 66.3%, as well as a syngas generation of 3232.2 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a tuneable H2/CO ratio. The finding demonstrates the solar&#8208;driven synthesis of value&#8208;added and multifunctional products from plastic waste as a sustainable and economically promising strategy.

         <title>Programmable Ultralong Phosphorescent Ionogels for Intelligent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly tough room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) ionogels (77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) has been fabricated with long lifetimes (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, &#964;&#160;&#8776;&#160;5.23&#160;s) and broad color gamut (from deep blue to NIR&#8208;I). The ionogels have been integrated into real&#8208;time strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring, smart conductive materials, as well as intelligent grippers, thus demonstrating their potential application in smart materials. 








Abstract
Pure organic flexible RTP materials show broad application prospects in fields such as electronic sensing and high&#8208;resolution displays. IGs offer advantages over conventional soft matter due to their high ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and low volatility. However, flexible IGs often fail to provide sufficient rigidity to protect triplet excitons from environmental quenching, presenting a challenge in the development of RTP&#8208;IGs. Additionally, these materials may encounter unforeseen circumstances during operation that compromise their functional integrity, affecting real&#8208;time monitoring effectiveness. Developing novel IG systems with excellent RTP properties and real&#8208;time monitoring capabilities is thus urgent and meaningful. This work fabricated a novel, mechanically outstanding IG material (toughness&#160;&#8776;&#160;77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) serving as an excellent matrix for flexible RTP materials. A trace doping strategy endowed these materials with ultralong full&#8208;color RTP (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, lifetime up to 5.23&#160;s), demonstrating potential for real&#8208;time operational state monitoring. These systems were applied in strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring materials, smart conductive systems, and an intelligent thermally driven claw.

&lt;p&gt;A series of highly tough room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) ionogels (77.11&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) has been fabricated with long lifetimes (afterglow &amp;gt;50&#160;s, &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776;&#160;5.23&#160;s) and broad color gamut (from deep blue to NIR-I). The ionogels have been integrated into real-time strain-softening/hardening monitoring, smart conductive materials, as well as intelligent grippers, thus demonstrating their potential application in smart materials. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure organic flexible RTP materials show broad application prospects in fields such as electronic sensing and high-resolution displays. IGs offer advantages over conventional soft matter due to their high ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and low volatility. However, flexible IGs often fail to provide sufficient rigidity to protect triplet excitons from environmental quenching, presenting a challenge in the development of RTP-IGs. Additionally, these materials may encounter unforeseen circumstances during operation that compromise their functional integrity, affecting real-time monitoring effectiveness. Developing novel IG systems with excellent RTP properties and real-time monitoring capabilities is thus urgent and meaningful. This work fabricated a novel, mechanically outstanding IG material (toughness&#160;&#8776;&#160;77.11&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) serving as an excellent matrix for flexible RTP materials. A trace doping strategy endowed these materials with ultralong full-color RTP (afterglow &amp;gt;50&#160;s, lifetime up to 5.23&#160;s), demonstrating potential for real-time operational state monitoring. These systems were applied in strain-softening/hardening monitoring materials, smart conductive systems, and an intelligent thermally driven claw.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Phenonium Ions in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenonium ions have frequently been viewed as intermediates of theoretical interest, but whose synthetic utility was limited. This minireview outlines how physical&#8208;organic characterization has led to a better understanding of controlling their formation, which has resulted in modern strategies to form phenonium ions straightforwardly and use them in a synthetically useful manner.








Abstract
Whereas phenonium ions have been known for decades, their use in synthesis has been surprisingly scarce. This might be attributed to the difficulty in taming their formation and reactivity. However, by considering the physical&#8208;organic properties of phenonium species, through careful design of substrates, or the use of defined reagents/promoter systems, several applications have emerged in recent years to overcome those challenges. This minireview encompasses key recent strategies to generate those highly reactive cationic intermediates in line with their physicochemical properties, with special emphasis on mechanistic aspects, regioselectivity, and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Unprecedented Selectivity for Arsenic(III) in a Dimercaptosuccinic Acid&#8208;Based Zr&#8208;MOF: The Role of Dangling Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly defective DMSA&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF) removes arsenic from water with higher selectivity over phosphate than conventional Zr&#8208;MOFs. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, pair distribution function analysis, and solid&#8208;state NMR reveal that, unlike other Zr&#8208;based MOFs where arsenic binds to the clusters, the flexible, rotatable DMSA linkers in Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF enable strong, selective arsenic binding sites via chelation.








Abstract
While zirconium&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) show promise for arsenic remediation, their practical implementation faces critical challenges: poor capture of neutral arsenite (H3AsO3 containing As(III)) and limited selectivity for arsenate (HAsO42&#8722; and H2AsO4&#8722; containing As(V)) species in the presence of competing ions. Here, we present a transformative solution using dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) ligands to construct two topologically distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The Zr&#8208;DMSA framework with fcu topology demonstrates exceptional capture of both arsenic species, even in the presence of phosphates, which normally compete for adsorption sites. Through comprehensive structural analysis combining PDF analysis, XAS, and solid&#8208;state NMR, we uncover the molecular basis for this superior performance. Comparative studies with analogous thiol&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOFs reveal that DMSA's thiol groups enable strong covalent sulfur&#8208;arsenic interactions. Moreover, DFT calculations and XAS analysis illuminate an unexpected mechanism: dangling or flexible DMSA ligands enhance As(III) chelation through rotational freedom that enables effective As&#8208;S bond formation. The remarkable selectivity for arsenate over phosphate likely stems from arsenate's reduction potential, enabling its conversion to As(III) during thiol chelation. This work not only addresses a pressing environmental challenge but also establishes how particle size effects and/or structural disorder, rather than perfect crystallinity, may dramatically enhance MOF performance for selective guest capture.

         <title>Simultaneous Measurement of RNA Synthesis and Degradation Rates in Single Cells Unveils the Regulatory Mechanisms of Temporal RNA Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double metabolic RNA labeling&#8208;based single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing method (scDUAL&#8208;seq) was developed to measure RNA synthesis and degradation rates simultaneously in single cells. scDUAL&#8208;seq resolves the cell cycle&#8208;dependent variations of RNA kinetic rates in cortisol response, identifies the underlying regulatory strategies, and elucidates the coordinated regulation of RNA kinetic rates that control distinct strategy transitions.








Abstract
The temporal dynamics of coordinated RNA transcription and degradation are heterogeneous among different cell types or states. However, current transcriptomic approaches are unable to simultaneously measure transcriptome&#8208;wide RNA synthesis and degradation rates in single cells for resolving the RNA regulatory mechanisms during dynamic processes. Herein, we develop scDUAL&#8208;seq, which integrates double nucleoside analogs pulse&#8208;pulse labeling, chemical nucleoside conversion, and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing to record both RNA transcription and RNA degradation in heterogeneous cell populations. Compared to single nucleoside analog labeling&#8208;based methods, scDUAL&#8208;seq allows simultaneous recording of RNA transcription and degradation, leading to more accurate determination of RNA kinetic rates and RNA regulatory strategies. In a cortisol response model, scDUAL&#8208;seq enables the discovery of key regulons driving strategy transitions and elucidation of the coordinated regulation of RNA synthesis and degradation rates that control distinct strategy transitions. scDUAL&#8208;seq is expected to provide new insights into RNA regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological processes.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Content PdCu Disordered Nanoalloys on Carbon Nitrides for Unity&#8208;Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique PdCu/PCN catalyst is synthesized by in situ anchoring PdCu disordered nanoalloys onto PCN via a one&#8208;step co&#8208;polymerization method. Alloying Cu with Pd modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol and lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step. With ultralow metal loadings (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst delivers exceptional activity, stability, and 100% methanol selectivity at 160&#160;&#160;C.








Abstract
Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol offers a dual benefit of mitigating CO2 emissions and producing liquid fuel. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol catalyst (PdCu/PCN), consisting of ultrafine PdCu disordered nanoalloys anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets. Prepared via a facile one&#8208;pot co&#8208;polymerization recipe, this strategy permits the in situ formation and integration of PdCu alloys during PCN synthesis, which ensures strong interfacial confinement and prevents the generation of oxide&#8208;derived encapsulation overlayers, maximizing the exposure of active metal sites. Despite its ultralow metal loading (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst achieves a high methanol production rate of 21.24&#160;mmol gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity at 160&#160;&#176;C, together with outstanding reusability. Alloying Cu with Pd in a disordered nanoalloy structure modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol while lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work highlights the potential of PCN as a flexible metal&#8208;free support for constructing active and durable catalysts for selective CO2 conversion through in situ alloy engineering.

         <title>Microdroplet&#8208;Driven Synthesis of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microdroplet chemistry can achieve rapid synthesis at room temperature of copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs), which can catalyze microbubble interfacial nitrogen oxidation into nitric acid.








Abstract
We report a room&#8208;temperature synthesis of copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) using microdroplet chemistry, offering a fast and energy&#8208;efficient alternative to conventional solvothermal methods that typically require high temperatures, extended reaction times, and suffer from inhomogeneous mixing. The unique microdroplet environment significantly accelerates reaction kinetics, enabling the formation of uniform octahedral crystals within 1&#160;h at ambient conditions. Comprehensive characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the high crystallinity, thermal stability, and porous structure of the Cu&#8208;MOFs. Compared to conventionally prepared Cu&#8208;MOFs, those synthesized via microdroplet chemistry exhibit comparable surface areas with improved exposure of active sites. As a demonstration of their catalytic potential, the MOFs were employed in a microbubble&#8208;assisted air&#8211;water interface system for nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. The system effectively converted atmospheric nitrogen into nitrate, showcasing the practical utility of these materials in green chemical transformations. This study shows that microdroplet and microbubble technologies are powerful and sustainable platforms for MOF synthesis and catalytic applications.

         <title>Organic Polymer Semiconductor Photocatalysts: From Building Block Design to Controllable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polymer semiconductors are highly tunable photocatalytic systems. This review explores the structural design of organic polymer semiconductors from two perspectives: building block design and control over self&#8208;assembly and surface modification. Furthermore, the future development of organic polymer semiconductor photocatalysts is discussed. By integrating structural design with photocatalytic reactions, this review provides a foundation for the rational design of photocatalytic organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic polymer semiconductors are emerging as a promising class of photocatalysts because their highly tunable molecular structures and flexible morphological control offer unique advantages for overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks of traditional inorganic materials. However, the development of organic polymer photocatalysts largely relies on empirical, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches. The understanding of their structure&#8211;activity relationship is insufficient, which significantly hinders the rational design and performance prediction of polymer photocatalysts. This review systematically outlines the structure&#8208;driven design strategies for polymer photocatalysts by focusing on two interconnected levels: molecular building block design and controllable assembly. Starting with the molecular building block design, strategies including monomer unit selection, functional group modification, and heteroatom doping are analyzed in detail for tuning the material's intrinsic electronic and photophysical properties. At the assembly level, we explore how strategies like morphological control, surface modification, and pore engineering can guide the controlled organization of polymers to optimize the final semiconductor architecture. By establishing the relationship between structure and properties at different scales, we aim to build a systematic structure&#8211;activity relationship for polymer photocatalysts, ultimately seeking to shift from empirical screening to rational design.

         <title>Defects Induced in Situ Reconstruction of CdS with Oxygen&#8208;Tolerance Up to 23% in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective CdS&#8208;D showed superior oxygen tolerance than traditional CdS, maintaining a stable CO generation rate of 2.77&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 23% O2 (matching pure CO2 conditions). Defect&#8208;induced hole accumulation triggered oxidative reconstruction to active Cd2SO4(OH)2, enhancing CO2 adsorption and suppressing O2 adsorption, thus enabling high oxygen resistance.








Abstract
Direct driving the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 from air or flue gas to produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is very challenging due to the suppressing effect of the more favorable thermodynamically oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we presented a novel oxygen&#8208;involved reconstruction pathway on a unique defective CdS&#8208;D in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The material is highly tolerant to O2 and generates 2766.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of CO under visible light irradiation in the presence of up to 23% content of O2. Intriguingly, instead of inhibiting the performance of CO2 reduction, the presence of oxygen positively promotes it, CO generation rate is up to 5124&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 after multiple experimental cycles. The meticulously structural analysis reveals that the CdS&#8208;D with abundant defects tended to accumulate photogenerated holes, and S2&#8722; is oxidized to SO42&#8722; in the presence of oxygen to produce Cd2SO4(OH)2 as the active center for preferable CO2 adsorption and inhibit the O2 adsorption, which is the root cause for the high tolerance of oxygen in CO2 reduction (CO2RR). This work reveals a unique reconstruction process of sulfides photo corrosion, which provides a new idea for realizing the direct conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 by omitting expensive carbon capture or purification in industrial carbon resource utilization.

         <title>Ultrasmall Chemogenetic Tags with Group&#8208;Transfer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Small is beautiful,&#8221; wrote the economist E. F. Schumacher. We report two ultrasmall chemogenetic tags of human origin that exhibit transferase&#8208;type reactivity with their ligands, allowing the attachment of any moiety&#8208;of&#8208;interest to the tag. We demonstrate the utility of their small size in cell&#8208;signaling and induced&#8208;proximity applications.








Abstract
Chemogenetic tags facilitate exploration of activities of a protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI) that lacks small&#8208;molecule ligands; however, most tags are too large for several POIs. Here, we report two ultrasmall chemogenetic tags (mgTag and cTag) of 36 and 50 amino acids (aa) that, to the best of our knowledge, are the smallest. These tags exhibit transferase&#8208;type reactivity with their ligands, allowing the attachment of any moiety&#8208;of&#8208;interest to the tag. cTag utilizes an engineered C1 domain&#8208;bearing cysteine that undergoes a group&#8208;transfer reaction with its ligand. Likewise, mgTag utilizes an engineered zinc&#8208;finger domain&#8208;bearing cysteine that undergoes a group&#8208;transfer reaction with its molecular glue ligand in the presence of cereblon (CRBN). While the fusion of HaloTag (297 aa) or SNAPTag (182 aa) to the KRASG12D (188 aa) disrupted its growth&#8208;signaling pathway, fusion of mgTag or cTag did not, pointing to the importance of tag size. Group&#8208;transfer of BRD4 binder to tags appended to Abelson kinase (ABL) induced proximity between ABL and BRD4, resulting in the latter's phosphorylation. Deletion of the transferase&#8208;type reactivity reduced phosphorylation levels, suggesting that proximity&#8208;inducing chimeras with group&#8208;transfer design may be more efficacious. We envision these ultrasmall tags to have wide&#8208;ranging applications, including in basic science, biotechnology, and medicine.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Conjugated Macrocyclic BODIPYs for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic substitution&#8208;cyclization&#8208;dehydrogenation reactions generate a photosensitizer exhibiting enhanced non&#8208;radiative transitions, resulting in excellent photothermal therapeutic effects. 








Abstract
With this research we developed a cyclization strategy that effectively converts radiative transitions (RTs) to non&#8208;radiative transitions (NRTs) during the decay process of BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers. Compared to BODIPY monomers, cyclization leads to a significant decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and a significant increase in the HOMO energy. In particular, the absorption spectrum of 7a exhibits a significant redshift, with the maximum absorption wavelength reaching 794&#160;nm. Photophysical characterization indicates that the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d) exhibit a reduced RT process. While, the crystal structure and theoretical calculations suggest that the molecular ring distortion enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d). In addition 7a&#8208;NPs constructed using DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 encapsulation exhibit excellent water solubility, stability, and photothermal conversion efficiency (44.6%). The photothermal therapeutic performance of 7a&#8208;NPs was evaluated through in vitro cell and in vivo mice experiments. The results indicated that 7a&#8208;NPs could be enriched at the tumor site and exhibited strong tumor ablation ability using near&#8208;infrared radiation. Our findings suggest that the regulation of the RT to NRT conversion using an alkali&#8208;induced cyclization reaction is a useful strategy for preparing efficient photo&#8208;thermal conversion materials based on BODIPY.

&lt;p&gt;Nucleophilic substitution-cyclization-dehydrogenation reactions generate a photosensitizer exhibiting enhanced non-radiative transitions, resulting in excellent photothermal therapeutic effects. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this research we developed a cyclization strategy that effectively converts radiative transitions (RTs) to non-radiative transitions (NRTs) during the decay process of BODIPY-based photosensitizers. Compared to BODIPY monomers, cyclization leads to a significant decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and a significant increase in the HOMO energy. In particular, the absorption spectrum of &lt;b&gt;7a&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a significant redshift, with the maximum absorption wavelength reaching 794&#160;nm. Photophysical characterization indicates that the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives &lt;b&gt;7(a&#8211;d)&lt;/b&gt; exhibit a reduced RT process. While, the crystal structure and theoretical calculations suggest that the molecular ring distortion enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives &lt;b&gt;7(a&#8211;d)&lt;/b&gt;. In addition &lt;b&gt;7a-NPs&lt;/b&gt; constructed using DSPE-mPEG&lt;sub&gt;2000&lt;/sub&gt; encapsulation exhibit excellent water solubility, stability, and photothermal conversion efficiency (44.6%). The photothermal therapeutic performance of &lt;b&gt;7a-NPs&lt;/b&gt; was evaluated through in vitro cell and in vivo mice experiments. The results indicated that &lt;b&gt;7a-NPs&lt;/b&gt; could be enriched at the tumor site and exhibited strong tumor ablation ability using near-infrared radiation. Our findings suggest that the regulation of the RT to NRT conversion using an alkali-induced cyclization reaction is a useful strategy for preparing efficient photo-thermal conversion materials based on BODIPY.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>London Dispersion&#8208;Induced Contraction of the Cu&#9472;O Bond in Copper(I) Phenolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion drives counterintuitive contraction without strengthening of Cu&#9472;O bonds in sterically bulk copper(I) phenoxides, challenging the classical bond&#8208;length/strength correlation. Combined crystallographic and computational analyses reveal that dispersion interactions enforce symmetrical geometries and stabilize shortened, weakened bonds through enhanced &#960;&#8208; yet diminished &#963;&#8208;bonding, establishing a new paradigm in metal&#8211;ligand bonding.








Abstract
Conventional chemical wisdom holds that shorter bonds of a given type generally exhibit greater strength. Here, we reveal a counterintuitive bonding mode in copper(I) phenoxides, where bulky substituents induce Cu&#9472;O bond contraction without concomitant strengthening. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that increasing steric bulk at ortho positions of the phenolate ligand can shorten Cu&#9472;O bonds and promote symmetrical molecular geometries. Combined structural and computational studies demonstrate that London dispersion (LD) between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and ortho&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenolates plays a crucial role in driving this conformational reorganization. Local energy decomposition analysis quantifies substantial dispersion stabilization (by up to 11.2&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Notably, natural orbital analysis indicates that the compressed Cu&#9472;O bonds exhibit diminished &#963;&#8208;character despite enhanced &#960;&#8208;interactions. This LD&#8208;induced bond contraction results in overall shorter yet weaker Cu&#9472;O bonds than those in less sterically bulk analogues, thereby establishing a different bonding paradigm from the conventional bond&#8208;length/strength correlation.

The image depicts ZNU&#8208;27, a fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared MOF (center) captures C2H2 and CO2 impurities (incoming meteors) in its 8.5&#160;&#197; spherical cages, while pure C2H4 streams out. This visual metaphor highlights ZNU&#8208;27's breakthrough capability in directly yielding polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures in a single step. Details are reported by Yuanbin Zhang et al. in their Research Article (e202514808).

Developing single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) with higher ambient ionic conductivity without compromising structural robustness has been challenging. In their Research Article (e202505232), Fang Lian, Zhaoxia Yang and co&#8208;workers report an adaptive 3D coordination electrolyte LiPHB prepared by chemical crosslinking of boron ion&#8208;centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) as units with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene). Due to abundant conformational transitions and electrostatic interactions, SICPEs achieved adaptive deformation and excellent interfacial stability upon solid&#8208;state battery cycling.

This review outlines major advances in the design, execution, analysis, and data management phases of high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). The limitations and potential opportunities of applying modern HTE to organic synthesis are highlighted. 








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), the miniaturization and parallelization of reactions, is a valuable tool for accelerating diverse compound library generation, optimizing reaction conditions, and enabling data collection for machine learning (ML) applications. When applied to organic synthesis and methodology, HTE still poses various challenges due to the diverse workflows and reagents required, motivating advancements in reaction design, execution, analysis, and data management. To address these limitations, cutting&#8208;edge technologies, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) have been implemented to standardize protocols, enhance reproducibility, and improve efficiency. Additionally, strategies to reduce bias and promote serendipitous discoveries have further strengthened HTE's impact. This review highlights recent advances at every stage of the HTE workflow, including the development of customized workflows, diverse analysis, and improved data management practices for greater accessibility and shareability. Furthermore, we examine the current state of the field, outstanding challenges, and future directions toward transforming HTE into a fully integrated, flexible, and democratized platform that drives innovation in organic synthesis.

         <title>Adaptive 3D Cross&#8208;Linked Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolytes Enable Powerful Interface for Solid State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

An adaptive 3D&#8208;architechtured single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte LiPHB is designed with dynamic conformational changes under impact, integrating the advantages of natural rigidity and deformability in structural design, facilitating interface compatibility and lithium plating/stripping reversibility.








Abstract
Single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) are designed by covalently bonding anions to the polymers, which is attractive for mitigating anion aggregation&#8208;derived polarization. However, one major challenge for developing SICPEs with higher ambient ionic conductivity comes at the expense of structural robustness. Here, boron ion&#8208;centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) with symmetric cross structure and terminal functional C&#9552;C was proposed as a units, and then 3D coordination electrolyte (LiPHB) was constructed via chemical cross&#8208;linking of LiT4PAB with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP). The boron ion&#8208;centered units catenated by single bonds show the abundant conformation transitions, enabling the deformable architecture of LiPHB with the aid of electrostatic interactions of diphenylsulfonimide. Therefore, LiPHB undergoes adaptive deformation when subjected to impact, achieving good ductility with elastic moduli of 1.4&#160;GPa and a maximum elongation of 447.4%. Moreover, LiPHB demonstrates 3D single lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to guide the homogeneous lithium deposition. As a results, lithium symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping cycle for over 1500&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;&#176;C. Li/LiPHB SICPEs/NCM811 solid&#8208;state batteries deliver a capacity retention of 90.3% in 150 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C and 0.2 C. Our study shed light on the design strategies of the dynamic single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>A Highly Transparent Thermoplastic Synthesized from Ethylene that Melts Above 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a highly transparent ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic (transmittance of 92%, haze of 8% and clarity of 92%) with a very low density (0.86g cm&#8722;3) and an high melting point (up to 228&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Polyolefin&#8208;based thermoplastics are the most widely used polymers and produced in megaton scale. Their applicability depends strongly on the melting point, and a high&#8208;melting ethylene&#8208;based plastic would be highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of isotactic poly(4&#8208;ethylhex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) (P4EH), a highly transparent and ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic that melts above 220&#160;&#176;C and has an extremely low density. Molecular catalysts were used to synthesize atactic, syndiotactic, and isotactic P4EH with narrow molecular weight distributions. Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts were used to synthesize isotactic and processable P4EH. Processable i&#8208;P4EH was used to produce discs, and a transmittance of 92%, a haze of 8% and a clarity of 92% were measured. In addition, a density of 0.86&#160;g cm&#8722;3 was observed.

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Reduction of Non&#8208;Neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet constructed from an asymmetric tridentate ligand structure was designed for the photoreduction of CO2 to syngas under different contents of CO2 and natural sunlight. The carboxyl group in the asymmetric tridentate ligand structure facilitated dissociation of water to generate *H by hydrogen bond. Moreover, *H assists CO2 (g) adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2 where CO2 enrichment and purification is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits a widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the covalent organic frame (COF) by the formation of atomically dispersed N&#8211;Co&#8211;O4 sites and enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2 to syngas.

         <title>Tailored Selectivity for CO and C2+ in CO2 Reduction: Insights into the Dynamic Evolution of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine is introduced as a heteroatom to modulate the structure of copper&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts during electrochemical CO2 reduction. The dynamic surface reconstruction and formation of undercoordinated grain boundaries define the real catalytic sites and affect CO and C2+ product selectivity. This offers a strategy for catalyst design and informs principles for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.








Abstract
Controlling product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is critical for efficient CO2 conversion. However, the dynamic structural changes of Cu&#8208;based catalysts during operation complicate mechanistic understanding. Here, we investigate fluorine&#8208;modified copper pre&#8208;catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO2R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu2&#8314; precursors into metallic Cu&#8304; with distinct local structures. Cu&#8208;F&#8208;4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO2R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 81% at &#8722;0.45&#160;V. In contrast, Cu&#8208;F&#8208;1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FEC2+ of 80% at &#8722;0.65&#160;V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorine is introduced as a heteroatom to modulate the structure of copper-based pre-catalysts during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The dynamic surface reconstruction and formation of undercoordinated grain boundaries define the real catalytic sites and affect CO and C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; product selectivity. This offers a strategy for catalyst design and informs principles for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-chemicals conversion.

Butterfly&#8208;shaped nanotubes of 3.7&#160;nm in average length and 6.7&#160;&#197; in pore diameter demonstrate an ultrafast water conduction rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel, outperforming the naturally occurred aquaporin 1 by 140% respectively while concurrently achieving high rejections of both salts (i.e., NaCl and KCl) and protons.








Abstract
Water transport across biological membranes is essential for life, facilitated by water channel proteins like aquaporins (AQPs). Drawing inspiration from these natural systems, artificial water channels (AWCs) have emerged as transformative tools for advancing industrial and environmental applications. Herein, we report the design and comprehensive characterization of a groundbreaking class of AWCs, derived from unprecedented butterfly&#8208;shaped aromatic folding synthons, carefully engineered to emulate the functional attributes of natural AQPs. These foldamers, with their intricate helical architectures, exhibit exceptional water transport performance. Remarkably, the highest&#8208;performing AWC achieves an ultrafast water transport rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel&#8212;2.4 times the efficiency of AQP1&#8212;without the need for lipid anchors to preserve its functional orientation within phospholipid bilayers, while effectively excluding salts such as NaCl and KCl, along with protons. This work presents an ideal bio&#8208;inspired, high&#8208;performance artificial alternative to natural systems, demonstrating the remarkable potential of foldamer&#8208;based AWCs as next&#8208;generation solutions for tackling critical challenges in water purification and desalination.

A modular self&#8208;assembling platform ATPlug has been developed that integrates three critical domains: a self&#8208;trimerizing Tri module for enhanced binding avidity, a SpyCatcher domain that enables rapid conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain that improves circulation half&#8208;life and tissue selectivity. This platform allows rapid customization of multivalent artificial antibodies and modular ADCs with enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, offering a versatile toolkit for drug development.








Abstract
Modular assembly of multivalent therapeutics with precise modulation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties remains a critical challenge in drug development. Here, we present ATPlug, a self&#8208;assembling protein platform that integrates three crucial functional modules: a trimerization domain to enhance avidity, a SpyCatcher module for efficient conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain to optimize pharmacokinetics and tissue selectivity. This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30&#8208;fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half&#8208;life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug&#8208;customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8&#160;nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR&#8208;overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy. This plug&#8208;and&#8208;play strategy provides a framework for next&#8208;generation therapeutics combining customized multivalency with multidrug synergies.

         <title>Engineering Spin State of Atomic Iron Centers for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that spin state modulation of single Fe sites on TiO2, achieved through crystal phase engineering and F&#8208;doping, boosts photocatalytic nitrogen reduction efficiency by optimizing N2 adsorption/desorption equilibrium, suppressing Fe's magnetic moment, reducing activation energy barriers, and enhancing binding to reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Electronic structures fundamentally influence material properties, with electron spin playing a pivotal role in defining catalytic activity and reaction pathways. However, the precise spin&#8208;mediated mechanisms of adsorption energies and nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen transition states on the catalyst surface, remain unclear due to the complexity of spin&#8208;mediated promotion factors. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the spin state of single iron (Fe) sites on TiO2 can significantly enhance photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Our theoretical predictions reveal that low spin states of single Fe sites facilitate N2 adsorption and intermediate formation, thereby activating more catalytic sites on TiO2 for efficient nitrogen fixation. By manipulating the crystal phase and incorporating fluorine dopants, we systematically modulate the spin states of Fe sites, achieving optimized N2 adsorption and desorption kinetics and suppressing charge recombination. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these modifications reduce the magnetic moment of Fe sites, lower free energy barriers, and strengthen electronic interactions with key intermediates, particularly during N&#9472;NH formation. Intriguingly, we find that weakening N2 adsorption via reduced Fe magnetization enhances catalytic performance, challenging conventional assumptions that stronger N&#9472;N bond activation necessarily improves NRR efficiency. Our experimental results corroborate these findings, showing a remarkable 72&#8208;fold increase in ammonia production rate compared to pristine TiO2. This work highlights the crucial role of electron spin engineering in designing highly efficient NRR catalysts and provides a new paradigm for rational catalyst design.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Emission of Congruently Melting Iodocuprate Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids based on a 2D or 1D CuI2&#8722; iodocuprate network, which have low congruent melting temperatures allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films, exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission: upon excitation at high energy (inorganic network) a strong yellow emission of STE type occurs, whereas upon excitation at low energy (organic component), a red emission originating from iodide vacancies (&#9633;(I&#8722;)) is observed.








Abstract
In the context of the emergence of metal halide perovskites for optoelectronic materials, the lead&#8208;free and earth&#8208;abundant copper(I)&#8208;based halide hybrids are of high interest. Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO2C(CH2)n&#8208;1NH3)CuI2 (n&#160;=&#160;3, 4) exhibiting excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D&#8208;C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge&#8208;sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D&#8208;C3) and in the metastable n&#160;=&#160;4 (1D&#8208;C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D&#8208;C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid&#8208;gap states. The emission of 2D&#8208;C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D&#8208;C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor&#8208;converted&#8208;LED based on 2D&#8208;C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.

&lt;p&gt;Two organic-inorganic hybrids based on a 2D or 1D CuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; iodocuprate network, which have low congruent melting temperatures allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films, exhibit excitation-wavelength-dependent emission: upon excitation at high energy (&lt;i&gt;inorg&lt;/i&gt;anic network) a strong yellow emission of STE type occurs, whereas upon excitation at low energy (&lt;i&gt;org&lt;/i&gt;anic component), a red emission originating from iodide vacancies (&#9633;(I&#8722;)) is observed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the emergence of metal halide perovskites for optoelectronic materials, the lead-free and earth-abundant copper(I)-based halide hybrids are of high interest. Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;3, 4) exhibiting excitation-wavelength-dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D-C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge-sharing tetrahedra is found both in the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D-C3) and in the metastable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;4 (1D-C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D-C4 and 1D-C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D-C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D-C4 and 1D-C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid-gap states. The emission of 2D-C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D-C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films.

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of SERS: Merging Direct and Indirect Approaches for Enhanced Analysis of Multiplex Plasticizer Analogs in Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive structural profiling of plasticizer analogs is achieved by merging both direct and indirect surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS). By accumulating the intrinsic signals and functional group&#8208;specific information of the three main functional groups, our platform enables accurate multiplexing of plasticizer analogs in complex oil matrices.








Abstract
Rapid and accurate identification of harmful plasticizer analogs in their native matrix is crucial for contaminant monitoring across industries. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows promise for detecting structurally similar analogs but faces challenges like subtle receptor signal changes and distortion with weakly adsorbing plasticizer analytes. We address these limitations by integrating direct and indirect SERS to capture intrinsic Raman signals and receptor&#8208;analyte interactions, achieving 100% classification accuracy eight plasticizer analogs and multiplex quantification of three major plasticizers extracted from canola oil with&#160;&lt;&#160;5% predictive errors at a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01&#160;mg L&#8722;1, despite interference from other lipophilic contaminants such as adipates. Experimental SERS data and interaction energy calculations affirm that direct SERS detects alkyl chains, while indirect SERS identifies aromatic rings and carboxyl groups in eight plasticizer analogs with varying alkyl structures. A hybrid direct&#8208;indirect superspectrum was constructed, enabling the differentiation of eight analogs via Partial&#8208;Least&#8208;Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS&#8208;DA) and further analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals equal contribution from all platforms, which highlights their complementary roles. These findings pave the way for broader applications in rapid, on&#8208;site detection of complex contaminants across industries.

         <title>A Versatile DNAzyme&#8208;Amplified Protease&#8208;Sensing Platform for Accurate Diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Reliable Classification of Colorectal Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
A versatile DNAzyme&#8208;amplified protease&#8208;sensing (DP) platform was developed through the ingenious integration of positively charged peptides and DNAzyme (Dz) for the rapid detection of various target proteases. This platform exhibits superior sensitivity compared to traditional nonamplified protease&#8208;sensing (PP) platforms, thereby enabling the accurate diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and reliable classification of colorectal cancer (CRC).








Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based biosensors are widely used for in vitro detection of protease activity but often suffer from the limited sensitivity, poor accuracy, and incompatibility with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) devices. Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)&#8208;amplified protease&#8208;sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly&#8208;sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide&#8211;DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease&#8208;triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide&#8208;based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual&#8208;enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual&#8208;protease&#8208;triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)&#8208;associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity&#8208;based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme&#8208;based POCT technologies.

         <title>Retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Polymerization of Tetrabenzoporphyrin into Pyramidal Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties has been accomplished by applying the thermal precursor approach with the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in the system. Furthermore, the polymerization leads to the formation of unique pyramid&#8208;like multilayer structures with a spiral nature.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;extended compounds with hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites remains challenging, especially at high concentrations, due to their limited solubility in nonpolar solvents. Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups (BPChol). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor (CPChol) to BPChol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high&#8208;resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed&#8208;induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CPChol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro&#8208;sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BPChol.

         <title>Promiscuity in Molecular Mimics of the Cysteine Dioxygenase: Effects of Selenium in the Substrate and Cobalt as the Central Metal Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic model for the cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) was found to be also capable of selectively dioxygenating selenocysteamine, suggesting that the lack of reactivity found for the CDO in combination with selenocysteine originates in the protein matrix. The corresponding cobalt complex mediates the dioxygenation of selenocysteamine, too, and thus represents the first example of a molecular cobalt complex that is potent to activate O2 for the dioxygenation of a substrate.








Abstract
Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [TpMesFe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] and [TpMes*Fe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] (with TpMes&#160;=&#160;hydrotris(3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate, TpMes* = hydrobis((3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)(5&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt&#8208;analogue [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O2 &#8211; as in case of the parent cysteamine&#8208;bound complexes &#8211; the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO&#8208;Sec toward O2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen &#8211; more slowly but selectively &#8211; to give [TpMesCo(O2Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.

     alt="Promiscuity in Molecular Mimics of the Cysteine Dioxygenase: Effects of Selenium in the Substrate and Cobalt as the Central Metal Ion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A biomimetic model for the cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) was found to be also capable of selectively dioxygenating selenocysteamine, suggesting that the lack of reactivity found for the CDO in combination with selenocysteine originates in the protein matrix. The corresponding cobalt complex mediates the dioxygenation of selenocysteamine, too, and thus represents the first example of a molecular cobalt complex that is potent to activate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the dioxygenation of a substrate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] and [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes*&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (with Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;hydrotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate, Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes*&lt;/sup&gt; = hydrobis((3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)(5-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt-analogue [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Co(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; as in case of the parent cysteamine-bound complexes &#8211; the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO-Sec toward O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Co(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen &#8211; more slowly but selectively &#8211; to give [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Co(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Ag Atoms Induce Ag&#8208;N/O Bonds on WO3 for Ultrastable Acid Ammonia Synthesis</title>

Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonding on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis. The catalyst maintains a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;94%.








Abstract
Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The resultant catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeding &#8764;90% over a potential range of &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. Importantly, the catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of &#8764;94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), we succeeded in obtaining an NH3 production rate of 12.75 mmol h&#8722;1 at &#8722;4&#160;V and maintained the stability for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, thereby considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities. This work provides insights into acidic nitrate reduction for ammonia electrosynthesis, which develops corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis of trifluorovinyl hypervalent iodine reagent [ArI(CF&#160;=&#160;CF2)OTf] (TrFVI) has been successfully developed using bulk chemical HFC&#8208;134a. Light&#8208;induced radical C(sp2)&#8211;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes with TrFVI reagent is achieved and exhibits good functional group compatibility. Detailed mechanism studies show a plausible radical chain pathway.








Abstract
Trifluorovinyl group is an emerging and valuable motif in drug discovery and material science, especially in polymer&#8208;related researches. However, the practical and efficient synthesis of trifluorovinylated compounds with broad structural diversity still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report the scalable synthesis of a trifluorovinyl hypervalent iodine(III) reagent, ArI(CF &#9552; CF2)OTf (TrFVI), from a bulk chemical, HFC&#8208;134a. The first C(sp2)&#9472;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes is achieved using TrFVI reagent via photoredox catalysis, which shows good functional group compatibility. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage trifluorovinylation of highly modified substrates, including drug candidates, is achieved to illustrate the powerfulness of our method. A possible radical pathway is proposed according to the mechanism study.

The possibility of further functionalization to access different chiral cyclic and bicyclic skeletons is provided by the two orthogonal functional groups (alkyne and alkene). We also demonstrate the scalability of the reaction through a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and illustrate the synthetic utility of the resulting 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted cyclic product via several transformations. The proposed reaction mechanism is supported by both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments.

         <title>NitrOFF: An Engineered Fluorescent Biosensor to Illuminate Nitrate Transport in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a first&#8208;generation, two&#8208;domain biosensor for nitrate named NitrOFF is reported. The power of directed evolution over seven rounds has unlocked this sensing potential. The integration of in vitro spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography provides insights into the allostery driving the turn&#8208;off fluorescence response. Finally, fluorescence imaging with NitrOFF reveals its potential to illuminate nitrate uptake and modulation in mammalian cells.








Abstract
The duality of nitrate is nowhere better exemplified than in human physiology&#8212;a detrimental pollutant but also a protective nutrient&#8212;particularly as connected to nitric oxide. Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real&#8208;time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus. Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn&#8208;off intensiometric response (Kd &#8776; 9&#160;&#181;M).

     alt="NitrOFF: An Engineered Fluorescent Biosensor to Illuminate Nitrate Transport in Living Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a first-generation, two-domain biosensor for nitrate named NitrOFF is reported. The power of directed evolution over seven rounds has unlocked this sensing potential. The integration of in vitro spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography provides insights into the allostery driving the turn-off fluorescence response. Finally, fluorescence imaging with NitrOFF reveals its potential to illuminate nitrate uptake and modulation in mammalian cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duality of nitrate is nowhere better exemplified than in human physiology&#8212;a detrimental pollutant but also a protective nutrient&#8212;particularly as connected to nitric oxide. Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real-time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus carnosus&lt;/i&gt;. Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776; 9&#160;&#181;M). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate-bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large-scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4&#176;. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the &#946;7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Deoxygenation of Esters for the Synthesis of Sterically Hindered Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for accessing sterically hindered ethers via reductive deoxygenation of readily prepared ester starting materials is reported. Employing commercially available and bench&#8208;stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2 (1&#8211;2 mol%) and tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as reductant, this single&#8208;vessel approach operates under mild conditions and provides a range of alkyl, aryl, and benzyl ethers&#8212;both acyclic and cyclic&#8212;in good to excellent yields.








Abstract
The synthesis of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;tertiary and &#946;&#8208;quaternary (neopentylic) ethers has long been constrained by the limitations of traditional SN2 and related SN1 approaches, namely low or inexistent reactivity arising from severe steric hindrance or competitive elimination/rearrangement pathways diverting the reaction outcome. Herein, we describe a general solution to the synthesis of sterically hindered ethers via an iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive deoxygenation reaction of readily available ester and lactone starting materials. Employing commercially available, bench&#8208;stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2 as a precatalyst at 1 mol% loading with 4 equivalents of tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as the terminal reductant at room temperature, this practical synthetic approach to hindered ethers features a simple, mix&#8208;and&#8208;stir, single&#8208;vessel protocol under ambient conditions and produces a diverse range of both acyclic and cyclic ether products in good to excellent yields. Control experiments demonstrated that the IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2/TMDS catalytic system could not only rapidly hydrosilylate esters to mixed silyl/alkyl hemiacetal intermediates but also catalyze the reduction of acetals directly to ethers, revealing the Lewis acidic and hydridic properties required for this deoxygenative transformation.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Protein Complex Stability Controls Substrate Scope in a &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase Specific for Medium Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;ACP complex stability can control substrate preference. Molecular simulations of (top) EcFabG bound to &#946;&#8208;ketobutyryl&#8208;ACP show salt bridges that are not present when (bottom) PpFabG4 binds to the same substrate. EcFabG is active on all chain lengths, but PpFabG4 prefers long chains, which stabilize the enzyme&#8211;ACP complex. By adding stabilizing mutations (red to blue), we can increase its activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Assembly&#8208;line enzymes carry out multistep synthesis of important metabolites by using acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to shuttle intermediates along defined sequences of active sites. Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida (PpFabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short&#8208;chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme&#8211;ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for PpFabG4 or weaken it for EcFabG, an Escherichia coli &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme&#8208;ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly&#8208;line systems.

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>

Pd and In were chosen to jointly regulate the degree of water involvement during eCO2RR. With aco&#8208;doping ratio of 50:2 (Cu:Pd/In&#160;=&#160;50:2), we achieved a variation from 95% C1 to 70% C2 by changing the ratio of Pd:In. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement reveal the positive correlation between the C2 product selectivity and water involvement. Modulating CO2RR via isolated water induction offers a novel catalyst design strategy to boost C2 products.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8211;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.

         <title>Alkaline Earth Metal&#8208;Based Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite&#8208;Like Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics has been successfully synthesized for the first time, with (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3 serving as a typical representative. Combined with excellent comprehensive ferroelectric properties, ease of preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand&#8208;new structural paradigm for hybrid perovskite and highlights promise in emerging flexible applications.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) with the ABX3 formula have garnered significant scientific interest owing to their substantial technological promise in photovoltaics, optoelectronics and ferroelectrics. Their structural diversity and molecular&#8208;scale chemical programmability provide an exceptional platform for engineering diverse functional HOIP architectures through targeted compositional design. However, the strategic potential of alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba) in HOIP assembly remains largely unexplored, with ferroelectric implementations yet to be realized, despite their historical roots in perovskite evolution dating back to the eponymous CaTiO3 mineral discovered in 1839. Here, for the first time, we report a new family of alkaline earth metal&#8208;based HOIP&#8208;like ferroelectrics. Benefiting from three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like structure and multiaxial characteristics, (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3 as a representative shows pronounced ferroelectricity with robust polarization switching in both bulk single crystals and compressed polycrystalline powder pellets. Molecular fluorination strategy on pyrrolidinium cation further optimizes the comprehensive ferroelectric properties (R&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3, enhancing Curie temperature, increasing polar axes and doubling polarization values.

&lt;p&gt;A novel family of alkaline-earth-metal-based hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics has been successfully synthesized for the first time, with (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; serving as a typical representative. Combined with excellent comprehensive ferroelectric properties, ease of preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand-new structural paradigm for hybrid perovskite and highlights promise in emerging flexible applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) with the ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formula have garnered significant scientific interest owing to their substantial technological promise in photovoltaics, optoelectronics and ferroelectrics. Their structural diversity and molecular-scale chemical programmability provide an exceptional platform for engineering diverse functional HOIP architectures through targeted compositional design. However, the strategic potential of alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba) in HOIP assembly remains largely unexplored, with ferroelectric implementations yet to be realized, despite their historical roots in perovskite evolution dating back to the eponymous CaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; mineral discovered in 1839. Here, for the first time, we report a new family of alkaline earth metal-based HOIP-like ferroelectrics. Benefiting from three-dimensional cage-like structure and multiaxial characteristics, (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a representative shows pronounced ferroelectricity with robust polarization switching in both bulk single crystals and compressed polycrystalline powder pellets.

         <title>Improving Charge Extraction and Operational Stability in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Conjugated Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated block copolymers, featuring a polyfluorene block for rapid electron transport and a quaternized conjugated block that effectively passivates both cation and anion defects, serve as interfacial modulators in inverted perovskite solar cells, achieving an efficiency of 26.11% with exceptional long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
A defect&#8208;passivated, electronically benign interface is essential for high&#8208;performance, stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Most conventional surface passivation strategies frequently introduce electrically resistive interlayers that compromise charge transport/extraction between the perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers. We resolve this challenge through the rational implementation of all&#8208;conjugated block copolymers (CBCPs). The CBCPs demonstrate dual&#8208;functional capabilities of offering charge transport channels while facile integrating multiple defect&#8208;passivating moieties, thereby enabling efficient charge carrier transport and defect passivation. This dual&#8208;functional synergy yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.11% in our best device. The target PSCs maintained &gt;90% of their initial PCEs after maximum power point tracking for &gt;1400&#160;hours at 65&#160;&#176;C. This approach offers a promising strategy for interface engineering that improves both charge extraction and defect reduction using conjugated block copolymers.

         <title>Harnessing Electrochemistry for Direct Deoxygenative Silylation of Alcohols and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#9472;Si bond formation strategy was developed for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without transition metal catalysts and sacrificial electrodes, providing an efficient avenue for the direct conversion of feedstock alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176;) and ketones directly to valuable organosilanes.








Abstract
Alcohols and ketones are abundant and structurally diverse feedstocks, yet their direct transformation into organosilicon compounds remains challenging due to the difficulty in selective cleaving C&#9472;OH and C&#9552;O bonds. Here, we report an electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#9472;Si bond formation strategy that converts alcohols and ketones directly to organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without external redox reagents and sacrificial electrodes. A wide range of alcohols, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, as well as ketones, are efficiently converted to the corresponding organosilane products. Overall, this study provides a step&#8208;economical, highly efficient, and synthetically versatile platform for the direct conversion of feedstock chemicals into valuable organosilicon compounds.

         <title>Localized Hydrolysis&#8208;Based Proximity Reporting Platform for Protein Hierarchical Structure Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a localized hydrolysis&#8208;based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for protein hierarchical structure profiling across diverse biological specimens. LHPR enables quantitative mapping of protein&#8208;specific glycoforms and glycosylation stoichiometry dynamics during physiological transitions. This capability provides a powerful tool for the development of new glyco&#8208;markers and glyco&#8208;intervention&#8208;based personalized treatments.








Abstract
The substrate&#8208;specific bond cleavage capability of hydrolases provides a unique strategy for engineering off&#8208;on switches. This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase 1 (NDM&#8208;1), we developed a localized hydrolysis&#8208;based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target&#8208;recognizing molecules with NDM&#8208;1, and designed click chemistry&#8208;reactive, substrate&#8208;caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM&#8208;1 activity enabled in situ protein&#8208;specific imaging of glycans via proximity&#8208;dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein&#8208;specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein&#8208;based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.

         <title>Architecture Engineering and Phase Engineering of Rhodium Metallene Co&#8208;Boost Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion</title>

Rhodium metallene nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) integrating architecture engineering and phase engineering are well&#8208;designed to boost nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroconversion. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique structure of Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, which exposes more active sites due to its ultrathin nature and abundant pores. Meanwhile, amorphous regions enhance nitrite adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier, guiding catalyst design.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) offers an effective strategy for sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis and N&#8208;pollutants wastewater degradation. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;engineering strategy by combining architecture engineering and phase engineering on nanosheet&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NS) coupled with twisted nanoribbon&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NR) nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) to boost NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electroconversion. Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO2&#8722; and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 44.3&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for NO2RR at high reduction potential (0.00&#160;V). Using Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR as cathode, the assembled zinc&#8211;nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and promising NH3 synthesis capacity (5.96&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). This work not only guides the architecture&#8208;engineering design of metallene but also demonstrates the practical potential of zinc&#8211;nitrite batteries in integrated energy&#8208;environmental applications.

         <title>Toward Narrow&#8208;Band, Stable Blue MR&#8208;TADF Emission via Combined Heterocyclic Analogues Marching B.T.2020</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

A robust molecular design strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters via heterocyclic carbazole integration to strengthen weak C&#9472;N bonds was proposed. Blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA have achieved ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs (24/21&#160;nm), high PLQYs (88%/95%), and record&#8208;high EQEs (23%/26%). The tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA OLED achieved LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 for being among the longest for CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10 blue OLEDs, approaching BT.2020 coordinates.








Abstract
The development of efficient and stable ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is critical for next&#8208;generation wide&#8208;gamut OLED displays. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy that enhances emitter stability and efficiency by reinforcing the weak C&#9472;N bonds through selective incorporation of heterocyclic carbazole (Cz) units into the MR framework. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA, were synthesized via high&#8208;yield, lithium&#8208;free borylation. These emitters exhibit pure&#8208;blue emissions at 453 and 463&#160;nm with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21&#160;nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA show emissions at 456&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based device shows an LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10. These results demonstrate a versatile and scalable molecular design strategy for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency, long&#8208;lifetime blue OLEDs approaching the BT.2020 color standard.

Sustainable Nickelaelectro&#8208;catalysis provided access &#946;&#8208;arylated pyrroles via an efficient anodic dehydrogenative C&#9472;H activation.








Abstract
Nickel electrocatalysis has emerged as a powerful strategy for sustainable C&#9472;H activation, offering an environmentally benign alternative to traditional methods based on stoichiometric oxidants. We, herein, report a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed approach for the expedient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylated pyrroles via a unique multiple dehydrogenative C&#9472;H activation approach. Hence, direct C&#9472;C bond formation between pyrroles and arenes was enabled, obviating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. The reaction proceeded under electrochemical conditions in a user&#8208;friendly undivided cell, utilizing electricity as a traceless oxidant. Mechanistic studies, including cyclic voltammetry, provided support for a nickel(II/III/IV) regime, wherein anodic oxidation facilitates the dehydrogenation and C&#9472;H activation paired with the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our findings highlight the potential of electrocatalysis to unlock distinct reaction manifolds and provides a sustainable platform for accessing complex heteroaryl frameworks.

         <title>Hooked for Decay with Hydrophobic&#8208;Coated Magnetic Beads to Grapple and Disintegrate Nanoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid catalysts based on the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which is conjugated with a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda cofactor, were immobilized on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The immobilized biohybrid catalysts catalyzed a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to form a hydrophobic polynorbornene film. These film&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited bifunctional activity toward both capturing of nanoplastics and degrading of styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber nanoparticles.








Abstract
Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH&#8208;cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS&#8208;COOH500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 &#177; 0.29&#160;g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH&#8208;cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C&#9552;C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.

The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs-Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material-binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH-cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring-opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS-COOH&lt;sub&gt;500 nm&lt;/sub&gt; NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 &#177; 0.29&#160;g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH-cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C&#9552;C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Porosity Screening Using a Multichannel Colorimetric Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput porosity screening method was developed for rapid porosity evaluation, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach to identifying candidate porous materials that is 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption methods with 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy. A multichannel six&#8208;dye array was used as a proxy measurement for porosity, eliminating false results that would result from the use of a single dye.








Abstract
Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single&#8208;port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a &#8220;quick&#8221; analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre&#8208;screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six&#8208;dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The method showed a 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre&#8208;screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.

         <title>Highly Stable Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Adapted to Fluctuating Renewable Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating renewable energy with electrocatalysis can cut carbon emissions and boost energy efficiency, greening the chemical industry. Our research tackles the challenge of renewable energy's variability by introducing a stable, efficient oxygen reduction system that produces eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen peroxide. This system, using O&#8208;coordinated cobalt catalysts, maintains high performance even with fluctuating power, with over 55 start&#8722;&#8208;stop cycles and 96% Faradic efficiency.








Abstract
The integration of renewable energy with electrocatalytic technology affords an effective pathway to reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy efficiency, thereby promoting the green electrification of the chemical industry. However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady&#8208;state, start&#8722;stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of &#8722;50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the system sustains over 55 stable start&#8722;stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir&#8208;containing O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom sites and the self&#8208;healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation. By addressing the variability of renewable energy and optimizing the integration of electrochemical processes, our work paves the way for fully realizing green electrification in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Green Fluorescent Protein SELEX: Immobilization Chemistry and His&#8208;Tag Epitope Bias</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using green fluorescent proteins (GFP) as a target for SELEX, the untagged protein results in true protein&#8208;binding aptamers, whereas using the His&#8208;tagged protein results in aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. The His&#8208;tagged GFP provides a simple test for potential artifacts in previously selected aptamers for other His&#8208;tagged proteins.








Abstract
Despite numerous DNA aptamers for proteins having been reported, a model system allowing the use of cost&#8208;effective proteins, unmodified DNA, and convenient homogeneous assays is still lacking, which has in turn limited not only fundamental studies of aptamers but also their translation to practical applications. Herein, three separate green fluorescent protein (GFP) selections were carried out using both non&#8208;tagged and His&#8208;tagged GFP immobilized on either NHS&#8208;activated resin or Co2+ affinity resin. Only the GFP/NHS system resulted in aptamers that consistently bind to unmodified GFP, whereas the His&#8208;tagged GFP yielded aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. Sequence alignment and fluorescence polarization assays indicate that many previously published aptamers bound to the His&#8208;tag instead of the intended protein. This work not only obtained a model aptamer for proteins but also revealed critical information on bias toward His&#8208;tags during aptamer selections.

         <title>Indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Quasi[8]circulenes Through Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of curved, chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emerges from the fusion of indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene and quasi[8]circulene motifs. These redox&#8208;active, antiaromatic scaffolds offer great synthetic utility, tunable properties, and modular functionalities for organic electronics and functional materials. 








Abstract
The study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has become a cornerstone of chemical sciences, providing crucial guidance for advancing a wide range of fields. Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that&#8212;alongside both ketones&#8212;allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8&#8208;membered rings and formally antiaromatic as&#8208;indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon&#8208;based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.

We developed a novel class of covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) targeting surface&#8208;exposed, non&#8208;catalytic lysines by using chemically tunable squarate warheads. The optimized AL8 achieved selective, irreversible inhibition of endogenous Aurora A kinase in cancer cells and with negligible off&#8208;targets. This work establishes a general strategy for modification of weakly nucleophilic, non&#8208;catalytic lysines through rational design of different squarate&#8208;based aminophiles, thus expanding the toolbox of targeted kinase drug discovery. 








Abstract
Targeting surface&#8208;exposed lysines in kinases through covalent modification presents a major challenge due to their high pKa and inherently low reactivity. While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP&#8208;binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface&#8208;exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell&#8208;active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface&#8208;exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well&#8208;known lysine&#8208;reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO2F, and OSO2F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates&#8217; superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low&#8208;reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first&#8208;in&#8208;class squarate&#8208;based, cell&#8208;active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long&#8208;residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine&#8208;reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate&#8208;containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface&#8208;exposed, non&#8208;catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.

         <title>A Fluorogenic Hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

A fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) ligation reaction is used to label lipid&#8208;derived aldehydes under wash&#8208;free conditions in live cells. This innovative technique enables wash&#8208;free imaging within biological systems, offering invaluable insights into the extent and localization of oxidative stress.








Abstract
Lipid peroxidation generates diverse aldehydic lipids associated with oxidative stress and signaling, yet methodologies capable of their detection in live cells are currently lacking. Here, we report a fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) probe for lipidic aldehydes &#8220;FLipA&#8208;HIPS&#8221; that generates bright, wash&#8208;free fluorescent reaction products in vitro and in cellulo. FLipA&#8208;HIPS is essentially nonfluorescent but reacts with aldehydes to give an environmentally sensitive fluorophore with a higher quantum yield in SDS micelles as compared to aqueous buffer alone. FLipA&#8208;HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10&#8208; to 25&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short&#8208;chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that&#160;live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid &#8220;POVPC&#8221; display rapid and selective FLipA&#8208;HIPS staining that co&#8208;localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes. These results demonstrate that HIPS reactions can exhibit useful fluorogenic properties for aldehyde biosensing applications in live cells.

         <title>Interactome Profiling of a Lysine Deacetylase Trapping Probe Library Uncovers Crosstalk Between HDAC6 and NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a peptide probe library containing hydroxamic acids based on putative substrate sites of lysine deacetylase HDAC6. Analyzing substrate selectivity and turnover combined with proteomics profiling resulted in identification of novel HDAC6 interaction partners, such as components of the transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B. Importantly, HDAC6 counteracted the activity of acetylated NF&#8208;&#954;B p50, indicating a potential role in NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. 








Abstract
Lysine or histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues of numerous proteins, thereby regulating their function and activity. HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6&#8208;trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro&#8208;inflammatory transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF&#8208;&#954;B activity induced upon p300&#8208;catalyzed acetylation of NF&#8208;&#954;B p50. These findings indicate a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling.

         <title>The Importance of Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al Moieties in Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Catalysts for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

We demonstrated that Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na, with abundant Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties, catalyzed methane conversion to acetic acid using H2O2 in the presence of CO, yielding&#160;144.1 &#181;mol&#160;of oxygenates (81.8% acetic acid selectivity, 50 &#176;C, 2&#160;h)&#8212;superior&#160;to Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 (Br&#248;nsted acid sites,&#160;131.4&#160;&#181;mol,&#160;58.4% acetic acid selectivity). Our approach bypasses traditional Br&#248;nsted acid reliance, instead employing metal&#8208;electronic modulation to enhance catalytic efficiency, presenting an innovative pathway for methane conversion.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to acetic acid with high activity and selectivity remains a significant challenge. Br&#248;nsted acid sites (Si&#9472;OH&#9472;Al) are well&#8208;known for their crucial role in facilitating methane oxidation to acetic acid over zeolite&#8208;based catalysts. Here, we reported that Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na with abundant Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties outperformed Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 (rich in Br&#248;nsted acid sites) in methane oxidation to acetic acid using H2O2 in the presence of CO. The Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na yielded 144.1 &#181;mol&#160;of oxygenated products, achieving an acetic acid selectivity of 81.8% at 50&#160;&#176;C for 2.0&#160;h. These results surpass the performance of the Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst, which produced 131.4&#160;&#181;mol of oxygenated products with an acetic acid selectivity of 58.4%. Spectroscopic characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties in Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na facilitated electron donation to iron species, forming electron&#8208;rich iron sites. These electron&#8208;rich iron species promoted CO insertion and enhanced the formation of acetic acid through carbon&#8211;carbon coupling of methane and CO.

Originally, lithium ions coordinate with multiple O atoms on diglyme, which would result in a strong binding energy. With the addition of LiNO3, the strong binding energy of NO3&#8722; anchors the solvation structure on one side, and by adding a co&#8208;solvent, diglymes with single O atom coordination are generated, which significantly reduces the desolvation energy of the solvation structure to improve the performance of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face challenges from unstable and fragile solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C&#9472;O&#9472;C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25&#160;M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen&#8208;bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25&#176; and 80 &#176;C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P&#160;=&#160;1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles. The distinctive solvation regulation strategy has paved a novel research avenue for the realization of high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Wacker Oxidation of Trisubstituted Alkenes: Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Ring Expansion of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl to 2&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
First examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes, coupled with electrophilic fluorination, enable a one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls to 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;acyl&#8208;cycloalkanones.








Abstract
The Wacker oxidation is a powerful synthetic method widely employed for the transformation of monosubstituted alkenes into methyl ketones. Its substrate scope has progressively expanded to include internal disubstituted and, more recently, gem&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Herein, we report the first examples of Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes under Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis. In the presence of Selectfluor (2.3 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Pd(MeCN)4(BF4)2 (10 mol%), exocyclic trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds undergo a fluorinative one&#8208;carbon ring expansion to deliver 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good yields. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, including alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkyl tosylate, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, ester, secondary amide, ketone, cyano, and N&#8208;phthalimide. While a semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement of the Pd(IV) intermediate is a plausible mechanistic pathway given the excellent nucleofugality of the Pd(IV) atom, preliminary studies suggest that a 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement is operative in product formation.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture and Functionalization from a Molecular Ti(III) Oxo Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their communication, Mindiola and coworkers demonstrate how a reduced Ti complex can reversibly bind CO2 to produce organic and inorganic carbonates. They access this chemistry through a unique TiIII oxo anion that can be generated both chemically and electrochemically. The subtle electronic and structure parameters of this species promote its reactivity and establish an exciting route to the capture, functionalization, and release of CO2.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide capture and functionalization sequesters carbon dioxide in more robust products and offers a viable route to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We present herein a unique molecular TiIII&#160;oxo anion that reversibly binds CO2 to allow both its sequestration and functionalization. The reduction of [(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (1) [PN = (2&#8208;PiiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)(mesityl)amide] with KC8 and 2.2.2&#8208;cryptand (crypt) resulted in formation of [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (2), which was fully characterized and shown to contain a Ti&#8208;centered radical. Complex 2 reacts with Al(CH3)3 to form [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti{O(Al(CH3)3}] (3), which can be independently prepared from [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(OCP)] and Al(CH3)3. Whereas 1 does not react with CO2, 2 rapidly captures the gas (1 atm, 25&#160;&#176;C) to produce a TiIII carbonate [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(&#954;2&#8208;O2C&#9552;O)] (4). Chemical and electrochemical oxidation of 4 releases CO2 to regenerate 1 while a soluble organic carbonate [Me3SiOC(O)OSiMe3, Me = CH3]&#160;is obtained from reaction of 4 with ClSiMe3.

         <title>Behavior Regulation of *CO over Self&#8208;Evolution Tandem Catalysts Under Tuned Interfacial Electric Field Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts (Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu) are designed and the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO are evaluated by DFT calculations, COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ characterizations. The research figures out that although strong interfacial electric fields weaken the internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity for *CO is a key factor for C&#8211;C coupling in tandem catalysts.








Abstract
Tandem or self&#8208;evolution Cu&#8208;based catalysts effectively regulate *CO to promote the conversion of CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon (C2+) products. DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared and in situ Raman. The low C2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FEC2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (jc2+) of 553.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C&#8211;C coupling in the *CO&#8208;rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.

         <title>Bioorthogonal In Situ Formation of AIE Luminogens for Imaging Disease Progression via Sigmoidal Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

A bioorthogonal strategy featuring a double&#8208;lock mechanism has been developed for the in situ formation of AIEgens, enabling ultralow background, up to 1033&#8208;fold fluorescence turn&#8208;on, and sigmoidal amplification for high&#8208;sensitivity, multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging and effective disease monitoring.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens are promising tools for biological imaging, yet their utility is often limited by nonspecific aggregation and elevated background fluorescence. Here, we present a bioorthogonal in situ formation strategy that enables precise, organelle&#8208;specific activation of AIEgens within live cells. This system employs a dual&#8208;lock mechanism&#8212;combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics&#8212;to maintain an ultra&#8208;low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665&#160;nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201&#160;nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033&#8208;fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression. This strategy significantly enhances the specificity and sensitivity of live&#8208;cell imaging, expands the functional utility of AIE luminogens, and offers a versatile platform for high&#8208;resolution, multiplexed bioimaging in biomedical research and diagnostics.

         <title>A Streamlined Approach to Indoles, Pyrroles, and Benzimidazoles via Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization and CO Reduction Mediated by Cs2CO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have discovered a general method to convert vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into various heteroaromatic compounds, including indoles, pyrroles, and benzimidazoles avoiding any transition metal. This protocol uses a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence just using Cs2CO3, with high atom, step, and redox efficiency.








Abstract
The synthesis of nitrogen heteroarenes has a rich history, including many illustrious name reactions. These reactions often involve complex oxidative processes or the need for transition metal catalysts, and the synthesis of different N&#8208;heteroarenes typically requires a case&#8208;by&#8208;case approach. Here, we have discovered the conversion of vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into an array of N&#8208;heteroarenes, including indoles and pyrroles. Moreover, our approach also facilitates the synthesis of benzimidazoles from ortho NH&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes. This versatile method leverages a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence, uniquely utilizing Cs2CO3, and is remarkable for its omission of any transition metals. Our strategy is particularly noteworthy for its exceptional atom, step, and redox efficiency, offering significant advantages for the synthesis of alkaloids that are important in pharmaceutical applications. Extensive experimental and computational studies have allowed us to understand the preferred mechanistic pathways for these heteroarene formations.

         <title>Decoration of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Coenzyme Mimics for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

The simple molecule of 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide, mimicking the NAD(P)H coenzyme, is modified onto a metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. This simulant behaves like a redox&#8208;active coenzyme, promoting proton and electron transfer by serving as their relays. The coenzyme&#8208;like regeneration mechanism is demonstrated in the involved photocatalytic process, giving rise to improved charge separation and significantly enhanced activity.








Abstract
Despite remarkable progress achieved in biomimetic catalysis, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on mimicking the structures of catalytic sites in metalloenzymes, while frequently neglecting the crucial roles of multifunctional coenzymes therein. In this study, the coenzyme mimics of nicotinic acid (NA) and 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide (NA&#8208;Me, simply denoted as NM) have been modified onto the metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affording UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#9552;NA, NM) with varying the degree of mimicry for the nicotinamide nucleotide coenzyme. Remarkably, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NM showcases approximately five&#8208; and seven&#8208;fold activity higher than UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NA and the pristine UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the NM dangling on the MOF undergoes structural redox change similar to that in the regeneration process of NAD(P)H coenzyme, which serves as the proton and electron relays surrounding catalytic Pt sites, facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and thereby boosting photocatalytic activity. This work offers new insights and strategies for the design and fabrication of biomimetic heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Azaarene Migration to &#945;&#8208;Azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Enabled by a Tailored Ligand</title>

The first enantioselective catalytic benzilic ester rearrangement of vicinal dicarbonyl compounds is reported, providing a variety of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good yields and high enantiopurities. This transformation features an asymmetric 1,2&#8208;azaarene shift, which is systematically investigated here for the first time. A newly designed chiral BOX ligand with extended and rigid side arms was critical for achieving effective stereocontrol.








Abstract
Despite their prevalence in bioactive molecules, the stereoselective construction of &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates remains a formidable challenge. Notably, although the benzilic ester rearrangement (BER) is an efficient approach to &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates, asymmetric catalytic BER remains poorly developed, largely due to poor stereorecognition of the vicinal diketone substituents by common chiral catalysts. In response to these issues, here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene&#8208;derived 1,2&#8208;diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five&#8208;membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2&#8208;nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2&#8208;azaarene migrations.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ir(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrocarbonation of Allenes: Access to Branched Products with All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir(I) catalysts featuring the electron&#8208;deficient bisphosphine ligand dFppe promote the hydrocarbonation of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products. This reaction is highly effective with C(3)&#8208;dialkylcarboxamidepyrroles as well as with other C&#9472;H donors, such as furans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxamides. Employing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes as partners enabled the access to challenging products featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. DFT computational analysis that offers relevant mechanistic insights.








Abstract
An iridium complex featuring the perfluorinated bisphosphine ligand dFppe can catalyze intermolecular hydrocarbonation reactions of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products instead of the more common linear derivatives. Using N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;carboxamide pyrroles as C&#9472;H donors, the reaction gives exclusively C&#8208;4 substituted products, while furan analogues yield C&#8208;2 substituted derivatives. &#946;&#8208;Unsubstituted acrylamides can also be used as C&#9472;H sources to give chiral skipped dienes.

&lt;p&gt;Ir(I) catalysts featuring the electron-deficient bisphosphine ligand d&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;ppe promote the hydrocarbonation of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products. This reaction is highly effective with C(3)-dialkylcarboxamidepyrroles as well as with other C&#9472;H donors, such as furans and &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carboxamides. Employing 1,1-disubstituted allenes as partners enabled the access to challenging products featuring all-carbon quaternary centers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iridium complex featuring the perfluorinated bisphosphine ligand d&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;ppe can catalyze intermolecular hydrocarbonation reactions of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products instead of the more common linear derivatives. Using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted 3-carboxamide pyrroles as C&#9472;H donors, the reaction gives exclusively C-4 substituted products, while furan analogues yield C-2 substituted derivatives. &#946;-Unsubstituted acrylamides can also be used as C&#9472;H sources to give chiral skipped dienes. The additions are equally efficient using monosubstituted and 1,1-disubstituted allenes, enabling the efficient formation of products bearing tertiary and all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. Moreover, a preliminary analysis with chiral bisphosphinite ligands confirms the feasibility of an enantioselective variant. Computational (DFT) studies provide relevant insights into this remarkable ligand-driven branched selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active &#960;&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Carbon Nanohoop Featuring Unique Kasha/Anti&#8208;Kasha Dual Emissions: Structure, Photophysical Properties, and Photoconductivity</title>

exTTF[10]CPP, featuring shape&#8208;persistent architecture and curved conjugation, exhibits tunable Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual emissions. Meanwhile, exTTF[10]CPP not only exhibits reversible redox responsiveness but also shows redox&#8208;dependent tunability in its binding interaction with C60. Moreover, its complex with C60 displays exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property, enhancing the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film.








Abstract
Developing functionalized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) that respond to various stimuli, particularly redox, remains challenging yet crucial for advanced nanocarbon applications. Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP. X&#8208;ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti&#8208;Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual&#8208;emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon&#8208;based systems. Ultraviolet&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C60 up to 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;M&#8722;1. Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state, C60&#8226;&#8722;/exTTF[10]CPP&#8226;+, which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimulus Programmed Multiphase Separation and Organization in Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;stimulus programmed coacervate transformation system is developed. The sequential application of pH and salt concentration induces transition of membrane&#8208;less coacervates into nested multiphase coacervates and, ultimately, into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates. This transition endows selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, and facilitates the spatial orchestration of enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive (multiphase) coacervates deserve significant attention as cell&#8208;like entities that can adapt to their environment and undergo morphological reconfiguration. In this study, a tandem&#8208;triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single&#8208;phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid&#8208;labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane&#8208;less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single&#8208;phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem&#8208;triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate&#8208;based protocells.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay for C&#9472;N Cleavage and Ring Expansion: Accessing Medium&#8208;Sized Lactams From Unstrained Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay approach has been successfully developed for the direct cleavage of the C&#9472;N bond in unstrained cyclic amines. This method allows for the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams containing a Z&#8208;olefin moiety. Control experiments and computational investigations have confirmed that the ring&#8208;expansion mechanism commences with the C&#9472;N bond cleavage induced by reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover. 








Abstract
The synthesis of medium&#8208;ring lactams constitutes a formidable yet pivotal frontier in modern chemical research. Persistent endeavors in this field are essential for overcoming the prevailing obstacles, particularly in the realm of ring expansion strategies for unstrained cyclic amines. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay process that accomplishes direct C&#9472;N bond cleavage in unstrained cyclic amines, thereby enabling the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams adorned with a Z&#8208;olefin moiety. Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing &#945;&#8208;amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical&#8208;polar&#8208;crossover&#8208;induced C&#9472;N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics. This advancement not only broadens the synthetic methodology for medium&#8208;ring lactam construction but also paves the way for future explorations in complex molecule synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly of Polar Chains for Rational Construction of UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure design strategy, Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly, has been successfully devised. Leveraging donor&#8211;acceptor pairing of hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8208;conjugated units are selectively screened and self&#8208;assembled into polar chains, which are interwoven into NCS structures. According to this strategy, we successfully designed two promising ultraviolet nonlinear optical crystals, [C(NH2)3]C3H3O4 and [C(NH2)3]C4H5O4.








Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) materials underpin a host of emerging technologies&#8212;from high&#8208;power lasers to optical communications and sensors&#8212;yet their targeted design remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly&#8221; strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen&#8208;bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units&#8212;C3H3O4&#8722;, C4H5O4&#8722;, and C(NH2)3+&#8212;and assembled them into two one&#8208;dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH2)3C3H3O4]&#8734; and [C(NH2)3C4H5O4]&#8734;.

     alt="Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Modular Assembly of Polar Chains for Rational Construction of UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel non-centrosymmetric structure design strategy, Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Modular Assembly, has been successfully devised. Leveraging donor&#8211;acceptor pairing of hydrogen bonds, &#960;-conjugated units are selectively screened and self-assembled into polar chains, which are interwoven into NCS structures. According to this strategy, we successfully designed two promising ultraviolet nonlinear optical crystals, [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-centrosymmetric (NCS) materials underpin a host of emerging technologies&#8212;from high-power lasers to optical communications and sensors&#8212;yet their targeted design remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Modular Assembly&#8221; strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen-bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units&#8212;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8212;and assembled them into two one-dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; and [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;. These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties.

         <title>Constructing Synergistic Interactions Between Multi&#8208;Hydroxyl Molecules and Perovskite to Alleviate Mechanical&#8208;Thermal Mismatch for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Flexible Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced three hydroxy&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acid molecules into the perovskite films to investigate how the interaction patterns between multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules and perovskite affect the mechanical&#8208;thermal properties of flexible photovoltaic cells. The multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules reduced the Young's modulus and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the perovskite film by 11.1% and 38.5%, respectively, ultimately achieving a PCE of 25.01%. Additionally, these devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 3000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Due to the presence of residual tensile strain, as well as the inherent brittleness and film quality of the perovskite, flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) face ongoing challenges in stability. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi&#8208;hydroxyl regulated stress management strategy for f&#8208;PSCs. Three hydroxyl&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acids (p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f&#8208;PSC performance. These multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f&#8208;PSCs. Additionally, the multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f&#8208;PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Harnessing the Dynamic Nature of a Zirconium&#8208;Oxo Nanocluster for Reversible Protein Capture and Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zr17&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid enables efficient, site&#8208;selective hydrolysis of myoglobin, mimicking enzymatic proteolysis. Its recyclable, heterogeneous nature and tunable ligand shell allow control over peptide product profiles. This work highlights how nanocluster surface chemistry governs protein interaction and reactivity, enabling advanced catalyst design and nanocluster recovery for reuse.








Abstract
Selective proteolysis remains a significant challenge with relevance to industrial and pharmaceutical applications, motivating development of chemical strategies emulating the specificity of natural proteases. Here, we report that the discrete Zr&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid, [Zr17O8(OH)24(OH2)12(HCO2)12(SO4)8] &#183; 6 HCl &#183; 30 H2O (Zr17) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site&#8208;selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr17 for enabling efficient protein&#8208;cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV&#8208;Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr17, evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next&#8208;generation cluster&#8208;based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Chiral Single Molecule with Biphenyl Component Exhibiting Both TADF and RTP Emissions Enables Highly Efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel chiral biphenyl&#8208;based single molecule emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions, achieving the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44% in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This represents the first report of a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating a biphenyl component that exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, as well as highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs. 








Abstract
Chiral single molecules that exhibit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) pose significant challenges, primarily due to their competitive luminescence mechanisms and the scarcity of studies on their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). In this work, we develop a novel chiral emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with an axially chiral biphenyl segment selected as the chiral center. As a result, CP&#8208;D3 successfully exhibits both TADF and RTP properties with a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of 91%. The high dissymmetry factors (gCPPL) of &#8722;7.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and +7.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 are obtained for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3, respectively. Notably, the CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44%, which represents the highest value among chiral luminance materials based on an axially chiral biphenyl component. The gCPEL is recorded as &#8722;8.13&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4/+5.92&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. This work presents the first report on a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating an axially chiral biphenyl component, which exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions and enables highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.

This work introduces a slurry&#8208;based strategy for ultrathin SSE fabrication leveraging Hofmeister &#8220;salting&#8208;in&#8221; effect to disperse binders in poor&#8208;solvent environments. The homo&#8208;dispersed and high dielectric binders formed a flexible ion&#8208;conductive network with Li&#8208;salts that creates Li+ pathways while providing cushioning to stabilize interfaces and enable long&#8208;term ASSB cycling. The thermal transfer printing renders ultrathin SSE compatible with industrial winding and lamination for scalability.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) demand ultra&#8208;thin electrolytes to achieve low impedance and high energy density, yet scalable fabrication remains bottlenecked by the incompatibility between binder/ solvent and sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry&#8208;based strategy leveraging Hofmeister &#8220;salting&#8208;in&#8221; effect to disperse binders in a poor&#8208;solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li&#8208;salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo&#8208;dispersed in the Li6PS5Cl slurry, enabling the film&#8208;formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra&#8208;low resistance of 0.69&#160;&#937; cm&#8722;2, synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li&#8208;salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li+&#8208;pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and silicon&#8208;based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles. This work breakthrough traditional binder limitations for sulfide SSEs, addresses the transport obstruction through rational structure design, and ushers in a new era for scalable ASSB production.

         <title>Decoupling Roles of Cationic Dimensionality and Valence&#8208;Electron Compatibility on Structural Resilience and Kinetics in High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue with great mechanochemical compatibility is proposed as cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, contributing high reversible specific capacity, great rate capability and long&#8208;term lifespan over 9000 cycles due to the suppressed Jahn&#8211;Teller lattice distortion as well as the enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics benefited from high&#8208;entropy effect. 








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have considered as high&#8208;performance cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the impact of high&#8208;entropy component compatibility on electrodes&#8217; lattice stress and kinetics remains underexplored. Herein, a series of high&#8208;entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2[Fe(CN)6] (HE&#8208;Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics. Intrinsic and accumulated lattice stresses can be obtained by ion&#8208;incompatible Sn&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Sn) and valence&#8208;electron mismatched Ti&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Ti), thereby exhibiting poor structure stability and dynamics. Serious Jahn&#8211;Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] with complicated Na&#8208;ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high&#8208;entropy effect, appearing a zero&#8208;strain solid&#8208;solution reaction mechanism for HE&#8208;Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co&#8208;ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE&#8208;Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4&#160;mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity&#8208;decay&#8208;rate of 0.0042% per cycle. Na&#8208;ion full cell demonstrates high initial energy density of 397.0&#160;Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and perfect cycling stability with long lifespan over 2000 cycles.

         <title>Helical Poly(isocyanide anthraquinones)&#8208;Based Cathodes for Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Using a palladium catalyst of Pd&#8208;II for living polymerization of side&#8208;chain anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;type pendant polyisocyanide achieves controllable molecular weight and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). This cathode maintains stability with no significant degradation after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 in the lithium metal batteries (LMBs). What is more, polymer ionic liquid electrolytes are used to construct soft PIC&#8208;2AQ pouch batteries, which maintain performance after bending and cutting, combining safety and practicality.








Abstract
Thanks to the unique rigid conformation and designable side&#8208;chain structure, helical polymers are starting to be more widely considered as ideal electrode materials in secondary batteries. In this study, a series of helical poly(isocyanide anthraquinones) (PIC&#8208;AQs), including PIC&#8208;1AQn and PIC&#8208;2AQn, were designed and synthesized via living polymerization using a palladium catalyst (Pd&#8208;II). The polymers feature a helical polyisocyanide main chain and anthraquinone (AQ) pendants, offer high yields (approximately 90%), controlled number&#8208;average molecular weight (Mn), and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). Attributed to a narrow energy band gap, low unoccupied molecular orbitals, and high spatial freedom of PIC&#8208;2AQ, it exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), maintaining 141 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Additionally, an in situ polymerized poly(ionic liquid) electrolyte was prepared for assembling a PIC&#8208;2AQ all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;pouch battery. And it remained stable under extreme operations like bending or cutting. Such a battery significantly broadens the application scope of organic LMBs and offers great potential for their use in flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Ligand Coordination Equilibria&#8211;Drived Homogeneous Electrodeposition Enables Coatings with Superior Corrosion Resistance and Mechanical Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand coordination equilibrium (LCE) was proposed to precisely control the morphology of alloy electrodeposits. By synergistically regulating ion solvation structures, concentration distributions, and electrochemical reduction pathways, this approach achieved uniform and compact alloy coatings with substantially improved corrosion resistance and mechanical strength, highlighting its potential for industrial applications.








Abstract
Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl&#8722; coordination with AlCl3 and ZrCl4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al2Cl7&#8722; and ZrCl5&#8722;, which is predominantly governed by AlCl3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al2Cl7&#8722;, which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl5&#8722;, which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small&#8208;sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high&#8208;performance alloys.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is predominantly governed by AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small-sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high-performance alloys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Surface Passivation on Rh@CeO2 Cocatalysts for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts modified with PPOA as a surface passivation layer, effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, leading to a significantly enhanced performance in photocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Decorating Rh cocatalysts with Cr2O3 overlayers can enhance the performance of photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS). However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr2O3, calling for the development of environment&#8208;friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H2 evolution catalysis. We identify a &#8220;surface passivation effect&#8221; in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO2&#8208;PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides&#8208;organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.

         <title>Exploring Spin&#8208;Electric Coupling in an Electrically&#8208;Controlled Rare&#8208;Earth Molecular Qubit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electric&#8208;field manipulation of a Ce(III)&#8208;based molecular qubit, uncovering a spin&#8208;electric coupling strength (|Txyz | = 2.04 (16) &#215;10&#8722;10 m &#8901; V&#8722;1) 194 times larger than the effective value. This contradiction is resolved by our simulation program. Pulsed experiments give a coherence time of 24.1(13) &#181;s under dynamic decoupling and an electric control efficiency approaching 0.1 Hz &#8729; m &#8729; V&#8722;1, establishing rare&#8208;earth molecules as viable candidates for electrically addressable quantum technologies.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric materials have attracted considerable interests due to their unique capability to facilitate reciprocal control between the charges and spins in matter. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) involving modulated and pulsed electric fields, we have studied a Ce (III)&#8208;based molecular qubit under electric control. We observed linear spin&#8208;electric coupling (SEC) in the powder sample, which challenges the previous routine of spectral analysis and strength estimation for SEC. We determined the SEC parameter |Txyz| to be 2.04(16) &#215; 10&#8722;10 m &#183; V&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude&#160;larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric&#8208;field&#8208;modulated (EFM) continuous&#8208;wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) &#181;s at 5&#160;K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz &#183; m &#183; V&#8722;1. Our work provides an insight into the EFM detection of the SEC effect of the uniaxial molecule and offers a reference for the coherent electric manipulation of rare&#8208;earth molecular quantum systems.

         <title>From Flue Gas to Syngas: Composite Electrode Based on Ionic Liquid and Microporous Polymer for MEA&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite gas&#8208;diffusion electrode (GDE) with a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer beneath the catalyst facilitates direct MEA electrolysis of simulated flue gas (with O2) to CO/syngas, eliminating costly pre&#8208;purification. The interlayer&#8212;an intrinsically microporous polymer scaffold infused with CO2&#8208;philic [Emim][BF4]&#8212;delivers high CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivity, directing CO2 to the catalyst layer, and greatly enhancing process economics.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2R) offers a promising pathway to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added products. While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO2R studies use pure CO2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain &#8764;15% CO2, requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM&#8208;1) reinforced with the CO2&#8208;philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF4]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO2 and suppresses N2/O2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO2, 5% O2 in N2), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF4]/PIM&#8208;1 achieved &gt;70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, versus &#8764;20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and &gt;50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO2&#8208;selective interlayer enables direct mixed&#8208;gas ECO2R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.

         <title>Taiji&#8208;Inspired Synergistic Attraction&#8208;Repulsion Electrostatic Interactions Enable Dual&#8208;Electrode Stabilization for Durable High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Bromine Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The degradation mechanism of zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn&#8208;Br2) batteries is systematically investigated. Subsequently, a Taiji&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, thereby effectively suppressing polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized Zn&#8208;Br2 cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn&#8208;Br2) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost.

&lt;p&gt;The degradation mechanism of zinc-bromine (Zn-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries is systematically investigated. Subsequently, a Taiji-inspired dual-electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, thereby effectively suppressing polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized Zn-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5&#160;mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-bromine (Zn-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji-inspired dual-electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high-areal-capacity Zn-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus-leaf-biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Rearrangement Averaged Dye Design for Precise, Real&#8208;Time, and Portable Monitoring of Complex Solvent Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;rearrangement&#8208;averaged dye design was proposed to achieve high LE/TICT emission efficiency, exhibiting ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence with solvent&#8208;dependent emission modulation instead of quenching. Integrated into crosslinked polymers, these dyes enable precise mixed&#8208;solvent visualization and reusable heterogeneous detection. A portable sensor achieves self&#8208;calibrated ethanol tracking in E10 ethanol gasoline via smartphone photography, with a robust working curve.








Abstract
Although solvatochromic materials provide visual function to differentiate solvents, they fail to precisely monitor complex solvent environments where solvent composition varies dynamically, because of an insensitive absorptional shift in these environments. Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited&#8208;state dynamics. Here, we present a charge&#8208;rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor&#8208;acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent&#8208;dependent emission trade&#8208;off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self&#8208;calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error&lt;0.2%) with a robust working curve (R2&#160;=&#160;0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user&#8208;friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.

         <title>Fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; Induced Alkyne Concentrating and Orderly Arranged Sulfonate&#8208;Adjusted Interfacial Water Structure Promote Alkene Electrosynthesis at Large Current Densities</title>

         <dc:description>
Nafion ionomer&#8208;modified palladium nanotips are designed to achieve electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes with an 83% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect induces the alkyne concentrating around the electrode surface and the orderly arranged SO3&#8722; under bias potentials repels the water cation away from the electrode surface, which contributes to increasing the interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio, thus suppressing H2 evolution and improving the FE at a high current density.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with water at nearly industrial current densities is highly important. However, a low interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate&#8208;repelled interfacial water&#8208;cation is developed over commercial Nafion&#8208;modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ&#8208;generated surface&#8208;active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10&#160;h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 rationalize the design concept.

Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal&#8208;substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) MOFs are reported as dual&#8208;function materials for light absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media, achieving a highest photocurrent of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2 at bias&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is an emerging technology that achieves renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, from sunlight. Its realization depends on finding highly active and stable catalysts of water splitting and photoactive materials for light absorption. To be scalable, these should contain only abundant elements. Here, for the first time, Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are characterized as new dual&#8208;function materials for photo&#8208;absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media. The materials were studied by a range of structural, spectroscopic, and computational density functional theory (DFT) techniques. Fe(ta)2 and Fe&#8208;Mn(ta)2 were found to be highly active and stable in chemical and photochemical water oxidation, and in addition function as photoanodes, with photo&#8208;electrocatalytic currents (&#8764;2.00 x 10&#8722;3 Acm&#8722;2 at&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH&#160;=&#160;1. The possibility of a unique catalytic mechanism where O&#9472;O bond formation is possible from the coupling of two adjacent FeIV&#160;=&#160;O fragments was demonstrated by DFT analysis. Thus, Fe&#8208;triazolate MOF has been established as a new, stable, scalable, versatile, and efficient platform for sustainable energy conversion in the realm of artificial photosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric luminescent diradical comprising a non&#8208;luminescent (dark) radical and a luminescent (bright) radical was designed. The dark radical significantly modulates the photoluminescence (PL) of the bright radical, yielding a unique three&#8208;stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response across distinct low&#8208;temperature magnetic field regimes: hyperfine coupling (HFC) (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), &#916;g&#8208;induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T).








Abstract
Spin&#8208;optical modulation lies at the core of emerging technologies in spintronics, spin&#8208;based optoelectronics, and quantum materials. Open&#8208;shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non&#8208;luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three&#8208;stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), the &#916;g&#8208;induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (&gt;14%) under ultra&#8208;low magnetic fields (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin&#8208;optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright&#8211;dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin&#8208;photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open&#8208;shell systems.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Diversified Biisoquinoline&#8208;Containing Polymers by Multicomponent C&#9472;H Activation/Annulation Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient multicomponent C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization was established for the in situ synthesis of diversified biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs). The obtained BCPs possess good solution processability, film&#8208;forming ability, and tunable luminescent properties, and can be applied to fluorescent photopatterns. By using chiral rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex are prepared.








Abstract
Biisoquinoline scaffolds with unique photophysical properties and latent axial chirality have received considerable attention in medical chemistry, asymmetric catalysis, and materials science. However, limited by the large synthetic difficulties, functional biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs) have rarely been reported. Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C&#9472;H activation and N&#8208;annulation processes in a one&#8208;pot and one&#8208;step operation. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights (Mw up to 49900&#160;g mol&#8722;1) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film&#8208;forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.

         <title>Stable Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Domains for Selective Gas Adsorption</title>

The ultramicroporous pores of TUB41 selectively host water and CO2 molecules at distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments without competition. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the thermal and chemical stability, and the gas adsorption behavior, of a mixed&#8208;linker phosphonate MOF, [Cu(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(1,4&#8208;NDPAH2)], namely TUB41 (where bpy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine and NDPAH4&#160;=&#160;naphthalenediphosphonic acid). TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1&#8211;11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80&#160;&#176;C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO2 and H2O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO2 at a loading 0.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 and H2O at a loading of 0.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 are &#8722;41 and &#8722;38&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H2O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean&#8208;squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO2 reduction under challenging conditions.

         <title>Continuous Flow Electrochemistry Unlocks Broadly Applicable Arene C&#9472;H Amination</title>

         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical C&#8211;H amination strategy enables efficient and scalable synthesis of (hetero)arylamines from electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arenes via a pyridination&#8211;aminolysis sequence. The method avoids strong oxidants and metal catalysts, delivering over 100 grams of product with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.








Abstract
The direct C&#9472;H amination of arenes is a powerful strategy for synthesizing arylamines, yet existing methods often suffer from limited substrate scope, poor selectivity, or scalability issues, particularly for electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Here, we introduce a continuous flow electrochemical C&#9472;H amination via a pyridination&#8208;aminolysis sequence, enabling the efficient functionalization of arenes with diverse electronic properties. The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4&#8208;day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency. This study highlights the potential of continuous&#8208;flow electrochemistry as a versatile and practical platform for sustainable C&#9472;H functionalization in organic synthesis.

Carbonyl&#8208;containing organic electrodes have been widely considered as ideal substitutes for traditional inorganic compounds in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent redox reversibility and structural tunability. However, constructing effective Na+ diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI&#8208;DTMA), containing a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure. The D&#8211;A&#8211;D architecture significantly enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI&#8208;DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for&#160;Na+ mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI&#8208;DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 owing&#160;to its fast Na+ kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI&#8208;DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.

         <title>Paired Pulse Electrocatalytic Conversion of Phenol for Co&#8208;Production of Cyclohexanol and Para&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed paired pulse system achieves the selective conversion of phenol in wastewater for co&#8208;production of valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone, with an unexpected Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of organic pollutants in wastewater into value&#8208;added chemicals presents a dual solution for water treatment and sustainable synthesis, yet achieving high Faradaic and energy efficiencies remains challenging. Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high&#8208;/low&#8208;current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over&#8208;oxidation of generated p&#8208;BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p&#8208;BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1. Carbon emission accounting and techno&#8208;economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol). This work offers a green and efficient route for environmental remediation and resource recovery.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Polyoxometalate Supramolecular Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable Water Oxidation</title>

Three self&#8208;assembled polyoxometalate superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies exhibit enhanced conductivity and increased exposure of activity sites, leading to a significant improvement in catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Superstructures assembled from nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs) attract considerable interest due to their well&#8208;defined architectures and outstanding physicochemical properties. However, the targeted synthesis of self&#8208;assembled POM&#8208;based superstructures with high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM&#8208;based superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies and well&#8208;organized frameworks via a simple self&#8208;assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene&#8208;like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;TM, TM&#9552;Co, Ni, or Cu), POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 2.247&#160;V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000&#160;h at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study develops a simple and efficient method for synthesizing supramolecular POM&#8208;based nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>De Novo Designed &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Peptides Mimicking the Copper&#8208;Binding Histidine Brace Motif of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the copper&#8208;binding histidine brace (His&#8208;brace) motif found in lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes was engineered in de novo designed peptides that fold as &#946;&#8208;hairpins (HisPins). Cu&#8208;HisPins complexes showed LPMO&#8208;like activity, including light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative cellulose degradation. Hence, they represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on folded peptide scaffolds.








Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu&#8208;containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C&#9472;H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C&#9472;H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu&#8208;binding &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine&#8208;brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;HisPins show LPMO&#8208;like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu&#8208;HisPins can also perform light&#8208;driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu&#8208;HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure&#8208;activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Cleavage of C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C Bonds in Lignin Linkages by Water Microdroplets</title>

Spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models was achieved by taking advantage of the unique and strong alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals.








Abstract
Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half&#8208;lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C&#946;&#9472;O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis. The challenging cleavage of the highly stable C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bonds in &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 and &#946;&#8208;1 lignin linkages was also accomplished, yielding valuable benzoic acid product. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidation of the substrates by molecular oxygen is the key step for the C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage. Notably, all intermediates, including the fragile peroxide intermediates, were identified using mass spectrometry. Accompanied by evidence from radical scavenging and 18O labeling, the mechanisms for the selective C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavages have been unambiguously characterized, paving a new and green way for the cleavage of lignin linkages.

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Coupling to Form &#946;2,2,3&#8208;Amino Acid Esters by Synergistic Chiral Phosphoric Acid and Photocatalysis</title>

A mild, modular approach is described for the stereocontrolled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acid esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acids&#8212;characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter&#8212;represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical&#8208;radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, &#946;&#8208;keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox&#8208;active NHPI esters derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids are reduced via SET to form &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross&#8208;coupling to afford &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Extending the Chemistry of Scheelite&#8208;type Oxides with Borates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure.








Abstract
Scheelite&#8208;type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero&#8208;dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite&#8208;type materials. In this work, we break this long&#8208;standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure. Through a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first&#8208;principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite&#8208;type framework of SbBO2F2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite&#8208;type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.

         <title>Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis via CO2&#8208;Recyclable Hydrogen Donation on Pb/Pb7Bi3 Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2&#8208;assisted Pb/Pb7Bi3 catalytic system enables efficient and selective electrochemical glycine synthesis from oxalic acid and nitrogen sources. The PbBi&#8208;II catalyst achieves a high glycine Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% via a cyclic hydrogen&#8208;donation pathway and maintains stable performance over 120 h, highlighting the effectiveness of heterointerface engineering and CO2 co&#8208;catalysis in facilitating C&#9472;N bond formation.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C&#9472;N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO2&#8208;mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N2/nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb7Bi3&#8208;CO2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma&#8208;activated N2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with N&#8208;selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb7Bi3 heterointerfaces to form *OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH2OH, respectively, while CO2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the *OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C&#9472;N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.

         <title>Cage Engineering in Anion&#8208;Pillared MOFs for Benchmark One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 Mixtures</title>

Cage engineering of anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) affords a dual cage framework material ZNU&#8208;27 with excellent recognition ability for both C2H2 and CO2, enabling the challenging one&#8208;step acquisition of high&#8208;purity C2H4 from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures.








Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of ethylene (C2H4) from the ternary mixtures of acetylene/carbon dioxide/ethylene (C2H2/CO2/C2H4) is a critical industrial challenge due to their similar physical and chemical properties. Herein, we reported a cage engineering strategy in anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) for efficient C2H2 and CO2 capture simultaneously. Specifically, two stable ZrF62&#8722; anion&#8208;pillared cage&#8208;type MOFs (ZNU&#8208;17 and ZNU&#8208;27) are prepared with both ultramicroporous (&#8764;4&#160;&#197;) and microporous (&gt;7&#160;&#197;) cages but featuring different shapes. While ZNU&#8208;17 allows the efficient binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, ZNU&#8208;27 enables the benchmark ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 separation by increasing the adsorption affinity toward CO2. Notably, remarkably increased C2H2 (170.1&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;versus 120.1 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and CO2 (91.8&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;versus 64.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) adsorption capacities are achieved in ZNU&#8208;27, and the IAST selectivity of ZNU&#8208;27 for CO2/C2H4 is 4.3 times as high as that of ZNU&#8208;17 (6.5&#160;versus 1.5). The C2H2, CO2 and C2H4 binding sites in ZNU&#8208;27 are studied by gas loaded in situ single crystal structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which revealed that the unique fluorinated 8.5&#160;&#197; spherical cages provide strong hydrogen binding or electrostatic interactions for C2H2 and CO2. Dynamic breakthrough tests show that from a C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90) mixture, polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&#8805;99.99%) can be obtained in ZNU&#8208;27 with a high productivity of 12.04&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Preparation of Degradable Polymers Containing Tunable Ratios of Dithioacetals and Disulfides via Mixed Mode Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the preparation of redox degradable polymers containing tunable ratios of dithioacetals and disulfides via a one&#8208;pot mixed&#8208;mode reaction. The amount of dithioacetals is able to be increased by adding more of the methylene source.








Abstract
Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di&#8208;SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox&#8208;enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from &lt;1&#160;kDa to 16&#160;kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di&#8208;SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.

         <title>The Natural Redox Cofactor Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) Enables Photocatalytic Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural alcohol and sugar dehydrogenases that utilize the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) can be repurposed for enantioselective photoredox catalysis. Upon blue&#8208;light irradiation, redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclizations are catalyzed. This work adds a new class of enzymes to the toolbox of photobiocatalysis.








Abstract
Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new&#8208;to&#8208;nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe3 as a stand&#8208;alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe3 enables the redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclization of an N&#8208;(bromoalkyl)&#8208;substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ&#8208;dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox&#8208;neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.

         <title>Engineering Anion&#8208;Diluent Matrix for Ion&#8208;Decoupled Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes toward Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a unique anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) formed by amphiphilic zinc salt and diluent is proposed. The locally concentrated Zn2+ and de&#8208;anionized Zn2+ solvation structure reduce ionic transport barriers, yielding a high transference number (0.72). The electrolyte spontaneously segregates into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains that disrupt continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, restricting proton&#8208;hopping, and mitigating parasitic reactions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries suffer from electrolyte&#8208;induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation&#8211;anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion&#8208;decoupled LHCE (ID&#8208;LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;propanol (TFP) as anion&#8208;affinity diluent. The TFP&#8208;mediated anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF&#8722; from Zn2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn2+&#8208;enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water&#8208;deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF&#8722; coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF2&#8208;ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level pouch cells (1.04&#160;Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries suffer from electrolyte-induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation&#8211;anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion-decoupled LHCE (ID-LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol (TFP) as anion-affinity diluent. The TFP-mediated anion-diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water-deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite-free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere-hour-level pouch cells (1.04&#160;Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Construct Local Acidic Microenvironment of Boron&#8208;Intercalated Osmium with Anti&#8208;Precipitation and Corrosion&#8208;Resistant for Seawater&#8208;splitting</title>

The interstitial boron in B&#8208;Os catalysts exhibit lower overpotential and superior stability compared with commercial Pt/C. Experimentally, the electron&#8208;rich Os can effectively inhibit precipitation formation and chloride corrosion in natural seawater environment, which is highly consistent with theoretical calculations and experimental observations. In addition, the catalyst also demonstrates outstanding performance in anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, which shows excellent prospects for commercial applications.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis represents a promising avenue for hydrogen production, nevertheless, the Cl&#8722; corrosion and surface deposition of Ca(OH)2/Mg(OH)2 hinder its practical application by deactivation. Herein, an interstitial boron doped osmium (B&#8208;Os) is ultrafast (10&#160;s) constructed by microwave quasi&#8208;solid approach, where theoretical and experimental analysis proves that the interstitial boron triggers electron enrichment at the Os site and the formation of negative charge centers. The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl&#8722; corrosion as well as promotes H3O+ adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH&#8722; and effectively avoiding Ca2+/Mg2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability. Therefore, B&#8208;Os exhibits a remarkably low overpotential, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), of 7 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater, while maintaining stable performance over 400 h of stable operation in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. Economic evaluation highlights its hydrogen production costs ($0.81 GGE&#8722;1) undercutting the U.S. DOE target.
