         <title>Complete Depolymerization of PET Waste by an Evolved PET Hydrolase from Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PETase displays great potential in PET depolymerization. Directed evolution has been limited to engineer PETase due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput screening assay. In this study, a novel fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening assay employing a newly designed substrate, bis (2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalate (termed BHET&#8208;OH), was developed for PET hydrolases. The best variant DepoPETase produced 1407&#8208;fold more products towards amorphous PET film at 50&#176;C and showed a 23.3&#176;C higher Tm value than the PETase WT. DepoPETase enabled complete depolymerization of seven untreated PET wastes and 19.1 g PET waste (0.4% Wenzyme/WPET) in liter&#8208;scale reactor, suggesting that it is a potential candidate for industrial PET depolymerization processes. The molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the distal substitutions stabilized the loops around the active sites and transmitted the stabilization effect to the active sites through enhancing inter&#8208;loop interactions network.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Isotropic Proton NMR Spectra in Solids using Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning provides a powerful and robust approach to remove broadening due to dipolar interactions in proton NMR spectra of solids.







Abstract
The resolution of proton solid&#8208;state NMR spectra is usually limited by broadening arising from dipolar interactions between spins. Magic&#8208;angle spinning alleviates this broadening by inducing coherent averaging. However, even the highest spinning rates experimentally accessible today are not able to completely remove dipolar interactions. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to determine pure isotropic proton spectra from a two&#8208;dimensional set of magic&#8208;angle spinning spectra acquired at different spinning rates. Applying the model to 8 organic solids yields high&#8208;resolution 1H solid&#8208;state NMR spectra with isotropic linewidths in the 50&#8211;400&#8197;Hz range.

         <title>Reversible Handedness Inversion and Circularly Polarized Light Reflection Tuning in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Macrocyclic Chiral Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized macrocyclic chiral photoswitches are capable of reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) in liquid crystals and diverse HTP changes upon photoisomerization. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven handedness inversion of the self&#8208;assembled helical superstructures.







Abstract
A series of macrocyclic azobenzene&#8208;based chiral photoswitches have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and characterized. In the molecular structures, binaphthyl is covalently linked to ortho&#8208;positions of azobenzene, and four different substituents are linked to 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of binaphthyl. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) when doping in commercially available achiral liquid crystals to form self&#8208;organized helical superstructures, i.e., cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). All the photoswitches exhibit reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light of different wavelengths in both organic solvent and liquid crystals. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable handedness inversion of CLCs upon photoisomerization. These are the first examples of ortho&#8208;linked azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches that enable handedness inversion in CLCs. The photoswitches with longer substituents display only HTP values decreasing while maintaining the same handedness.

         <title>Uncovering Aging Chemistry of Perovskite Precursor Solutions and Anti&#8208;aging Mechanism of Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) is established as a molecular probe to unveil the aging chemistry of perovskite precursor solutions. In addition to uncovering the molecular mechanism of chemical aging reactions, it is demonstrated that the structure and stability difference of precursor&#8208;additive interactions determines the anti&#8208;aging effects of additives.







Abstract
The aging of precursor solutions is the major stumbling block for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time we used the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to molecularly explore the perovskite precursor solution chemistry. We identified that the methylammonium and formamidinium cations and the I&#8722; anion are the motivators of the aging chemistry. Further, we introduced two kinds of Lewis bases, triethyl phosphate (TP) and ethyl ethanesulfonate (EE), as new additives in the solution and unraveled that both of them can protect the reactive cations from aging through weak interactions. Significantly, TP is superior to EE in enhancing long&#8208;term solution stability as it can well&#8208;maintain the internal interaction structures within the solution phase. The PSC derived from a fresh TP&#8208;doped solution delivered a high power conversion efficiency of 23.06&#8201;%, 92.23&#8201;% of which remained in that from a 21&#8208;day&#8208;old solution.

         <title>Site&#8208; and Stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Strained (Hetero)Cycloalkanols Enabled by Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of chiral bidentate boryl ligand (CBL) and iridium precursor was found effective in catalyzing carbamate&#8208;directed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of strained (hetero)cycloalkanols in a site&#8208; and stereoselective manner. This method features broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples), excellent site&#8208;selectivity, and high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% ee), providing a robust protocol for access to diverse, densely substituted (hetero)cycloalkanols.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8722;H activation of strained (hetero)cycloalkanes remains a formidable challenge. We herein report a carbamate&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanol derivatives. A variety of densely functionalized cyclopropanols were obtained in good enantioselectivities via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. In addition, site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of methine groups furnished &#945;&#8208;borylated (hetero)cycloalkanols in moderate to good yields. The synthetic utility of the method was further shown in a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse downstream transformations of borylated products.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Fluorinated Cyclic Ether with a Low Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cosolvents, MFSI and TFF, were synthesized and investigated for lithium metal batteries. Among the four different electrolytes, the TFF&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibited the highest coulombic efficiency of 99.59&#8201;%, which is due to the low redox potential of TFF promoting the anion reduction, leading to an inorganic SEI formation.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for developing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMB). Here, we synthesized two cosolvents methyl bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (MFSI) and 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorotetrahydrofuran (TFF) with significantly different reduction potentials and add them into LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolytes. The LiFSI/TFF&#8208;DME electrolyte gave an average Li Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.41&#8201;% over 200 cycles, while the average Li CEs for MFSI&#8208;based electrolyte is only 98.62&#8201;%. Additionally, the TFF&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a more reversible performance than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fluorinated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxylbutane electrolyte in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cell and anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell. More importantly, the decomposition product from bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion could react with ether solvent, which destroyed the SEI, thus decreasing cell performance. These key discoveries provide new insights into the rational design of electrolyte solvents and cosolvents for LMB.

         <title>Comprehensive H2O Molecules Regulation via Deep Eutectic Solvents for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>

The Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;sulfolane&#8208;water hybrid electrolytes based on the deep eutectic solvents present an efficient strategy for hydrogen bond network reconstruction and multifunctional interfaces optimization, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping and excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The corrosion, parasitic reactions, and aggravated dendrite growth severely restrict development of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Here, we report a novel strategy to break the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and construct the Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;sulfolane&#8208;H2O deep eutectic solvents. This strategy cuts off the transfer of protons/hydroxides and inhibits the activity of H2O, as reflected in a much lower freezing point (&lt;&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C), a significantly larger electrochemical stable window (&gt;3&#8197;V), and suppressed evaporative water from electrolytes. Stable Zn plating/stripping for over 9600&#8197;h was obtained. Based on experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, it has been proved that sulfolane can effectively regulate solvation shell and simultaneously build the multifunctional Zn&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the multi&#8208;layer homemade modular cell and 1.32&#8197;Ah pouch cell further confirm its prospect for practical application.

         <title>Helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;Based Chromophores with B&#8722;O&#8722;B Bridge: Facile Synthesis and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8208;bridged chromophores has shown that the bridge leads to distorted conformations. This results in the chromophores having excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties, such as tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL) of 11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the near&#8208;infrared region observed for one of the compounds.







Abstract
It is essential to create organic compounds that exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Helicene&#8208;type emitters possess appealing chiroptical features, however, such NIR molecules are scarce due to a paucity of synthetic strategies. Herein, we developed a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY analogs that were synthesized conveniently. The reaction of diimino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo with a heteroaromatic amine produced a restricted ligand cavity, which triggered off the generation of a B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge. The B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge led to distorted conformations that satisfy the helical requirements, resulting in excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties. Tunable CPL with the highest luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL=11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in the NIR region was achieved. This synthetic approach is expected to offer a new opportunity to chiral chemistry and increase flexibility for chiroptical tuning.

         <title>Constructing 2D Sandwich&#8208;like MOF/MXene Heterostructures for Durable and Fast Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits a molecular&#8208;scale hybridized MOF (Cu&#8208;HHTP) and MX (V2CTx MXene) nanosheets, is successfully synthesized. The results show that the Zn2+ storage capability of such a 2D heterostructure is boosted by enhancing the structural stability, electrical conductivity, and the utilization of active sites.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) can be used as the cathodes for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion battery due to their large one&#8208;dimensional channels. However, the conventionally poor electrical conductivity and low structural stability hinder their advances. Herein, we report an alternately stacked MOF/MX heterostructure, exhibiting the 2D sandwich&#8208;like structure with abundant active sites, improved electrical conductivity and exceptional structural stability. Ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal a reversible intercalation mechanism of zinc ions and high electrical conductivity in the 2D heterostructure. Electrochemical tests confirm excellent Zn2+ migration kinetics and ideal pseudocapacitive behaviors. As a consequence, Cu&#8208;HHTP/MX shows a superior rate performance (260.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 173.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 92.5&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Cooperative Catalysis of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Adsorption Competition by Tuning Cationic Geometric Configuration of Dual&#8208;active Sites in Spinel Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation behind attractive physicochemical properties functions as a universal descriptor for determining the geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalysis. By tuning cationic geometric configuration in spinel oxides, the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorption competition on Mn3+Oh&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+Td backbones is well leveraged to spark the cooperative catalysis of LiPSs in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Fundamentally understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship is critical to design advanced electrocatalysts for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, which remains a formidable challenge. Herein, by manipulating the regulable cations in spinel oxides, their geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalytic activity for sulfur redox is investigated. Experimental and theoretical analyses validate that the modulation essence of cooperative catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is dominated by LiPSs adsorption competition between Co3+ tetrahedral (Td) and Mn3+ octahedral (Oh) sites on Mn3+Oh&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+Td backbones. Specifically, high&#8208;spin Co3+Td with stronger Co&#8722;S covalency anchors LiPSs persistently, while electron delocalized Mn3+Oh with adsorptive orbital (dz2) functions better in catalyzing specialized LiPSs conversion. This work inaugurates a universal strategy for sculpting geometrical configuration to achieve charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation in electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Chemodivergent, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Cycloaddition Reactions between 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein are ligand controlled, chemodivergent [4+2] or [2+2] cycloaddition reactions between readily available 1,3&#8208;dienes and alkynes. These reactions, catalyzed by cationic CoI proceed with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivies to give nearly enantiopure functionalized 1,4&#8208; cyclohexadienes or cyclobutenes from the same starting materials.







Abstract
Alkynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes are among the most readily available precursors for organic synthesis. We report two distinctly different, catalyst&#8208;dependent, modes of regio&#8208; and enantioselective cycloaddition reactions between these classes of compounds providing rapid access to highly functionalized 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes or cyclobutenes from the same precursors. Complexes of an earth abundant metal, cobalt, with several commercially available chiral bisphosphine ligands with narrow bite angles catalyze [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions between a 1,3&#8208;diene and an alkyne giving a cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene in excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In sharp contrast, complex of a finely tuned phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligand promotes unique [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between the alkyne and the terminal double bond of the diene giving a highly functionalized cyclobutene in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Disruption of Zinc Homeostasis by a Novel Platinum(IV)&#8208;Terthiophene Complex for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel cyclometalated PtIV&#8208;terthiophene complex as the first metal&#8208;based zinc homeostatic medicine that regulates zinc homeostasis to activate antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Zinc homeostatic medicine is of great potential for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy; however, there are few reports on antitumor compounds that can trigger Zn2+&#8208;mediated immune responses. In this work, we developed a novel cyclometalated PtIV&#8208;terthiophene complex, Pt3, that not only induces DNA damage and cellular metabolism dysregulation, but also disrupts zinc homeostasis as indicated by the abnormal transcriptional level of zinc regulatory proteins, excess accumulation of Zn2+ in cytoplasm, and down&#8208;regulation of metallothioneins (MTs), which further caused redox imbalance. The simultaneous disruption of zinc and redox homeostasis in response to Pt3 treatment activated gasdermin&#8208;D mediated pyroptosis accompanied by cytoskeleton remodeling, thus releasing pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T cell tumor&#8208;infiltration, eventually eliminating both primary and distant tumors in vivo. As far as we know, this is the first metal complex that can regulate zinc homeostasis to activate antitumor immunity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom or Dual&#8208;Atom in TiO2 Nanosheet: Which is the Better Choice for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 active center in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favourable for producing urea, and experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier as compared with single&#8208;atom Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.







Abstract
As rising star materials, single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely reported in the electro&#8208;catalysis area. To answer the key question: single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts, which is better for electrocatalytic urea synthesis? we design two types of catalysts via a vacancy&#8208;anchorage strategy: single&#8208;atom Pd1&#8722;TiO2 and dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 nanosheets. An ultrahigh urea activity of 166.67&#8197;molurea&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h1 with the corresponding 22.54&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved over Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2, which is much higher than that of Pd1&#8722;TiO2. Various characterization including an in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and theoretical calculations demonstrate that dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 site in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favorable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier compared with Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Directed Symmetry Breaking and Spin Filtering of Supramolecular Assemblies from only Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical nanofibers have been prepared from exclusively achiral building blocks upon ultrasonication&#8208;induced morphology transformation. The as&#8208;made helical nanofibers show a more robust and repeatable control of the helical handedness compared with those generated using common chiral solvents. It was further verified that the helical nanofibers can act as a spin filter with a comparable spin polarization (45&#8201;%) at room temperature.







Abstract
Herein we describe the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral molecule into macroscopic helicity as well as the emergent chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect. It was found that a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif with an aminopyridine group in each arm could coordinate with AgI and self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres. Upon sonication, symmetry breaking occurred and the nanospheres transferred into helical nanofibers with strong CD signals. Although the sign of the CD signals appeared randomly, it could be controlled by using the as&#8208;made chiral assemblies as a seed. Furthermore, it was found that the charge transport of the helical nanofibers was highly selective with a spin&#8208;polarization transport of up to 45&#8201;%, although the chiral nanofibers are composed exclusively from achiral building blocks. This work demonstrates symmetry breaking under sonication and the chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect.

&lt;p&gt;Helical nanofibers have been prepared from exclusively achiral building blocks upon ultrasonication-induced morphology transformation. The as-made helical nanofibers show a more robust and repeatable control of the helical handedness compared with those generated using common chiral solvents. It was further verified that the helical nanofibers can act as a spin filter with a comparable spin polarization (45&#8201;%) at room temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrochemical Cell&#8208;Free Biosensors for Antibody Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum using electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensors. The platform is based on programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the transcription of an RNA sequence consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor.







Abstract
We report here the development of an electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensor for antibody detection directly in complex sample matrices with high sensitivity and specificity that is particularly suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The approach is based on the use of programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a specific target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected using a redox&#8208;modified probe strand immobilized to a disposable electrode. The platform couples the features of high sensitivity and specificity of cell&#8208;free systems and the strength of cost&#8208;effectiveness and possible miniaturization provided by the electrochemical detection. We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of three different antibodies, including the clinically&#8208;relevant Anti&#8208;HA antibody.

         <title>Rational Design of Ferroelectric 2D Perovskite for Improving the Efficiency of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Over 23&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite has been designed based on a pyridine ring as the organic interlayer. Incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field and optimized perovskite crystallization, delivering an exceptional efficiency over 23&#8201;% for flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Despite the great progress of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs), it still faces several challenges during the homogeneous fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films, and overcoming the insufficient exciton dissociation. To the ends, we rationally design the ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite based on pyridine heterocyclic ring as the organic interlayer. We uncover that incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field (BEF), which enhances the exciton dissociation efficiency in the device. Moreover, the 2D seeds could assist the 3D crystallization by forming more homogeneous and highly&#8208;oriented perovskite crystals. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 23&#8201;% has been achieved by the f&#8208;PSCs with outstanding ambient stability. Moreover, the piezo/ferroelectric 2D perovskite intrigues a decreased hole transport barriers at the ITO/perovskite interface under tensile stress, which opens new possibilities for developing highly&#8208;efficient f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB Upconversion, Solvent Sensitization and Challenging Bond Activation Enabled by a Benzene&#8208;Based Annihilator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB photon upconversion (UC) enabled by a benzene&#8208;based annihilator is presented for the first time. The annihilator's unprecedented singlet&#8208;excited energy of 4.15&#8197;eV was successfully employed to activate inert carbonyls via a subsequent FRET energy transfer. This UC&#8208;FRET reaction scheme was directly monitored by laser techniques and exploited in lab&#8208;scale NMR experiments demonstrating its potential in light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.







Abstract
Several energy&#8208;demanding photoreactions require harsh UV light from inefficient light sources. The conversion of low&#8208;energy visible light to high&#8208;energy singlet states via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) could offer a solution for driving such reactions under mild conditions. We present the first annihilator with an emission maximum in the UVB region that, combined with an organic sensitizer, is suitable for blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB upconversion. The annihilator singlet was successfully employed as an energy donor in subsequent FRET activations of aliphatic carbonyls. This hitherto unreported UC&#8208;FRET reaction sequence was directly monitored using laser spectroscopy and applied to mechanistic irradiation experiments demonstrating the feasibility of Norrish chemistry. Our results provide clear evidence for a novel blue light&#8208;driven substrate or solvent activation strategy, which is important in the context of developing more sustainable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion systems.

         <title>I2&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Ynamides: Chemoselective and Divergent Access to Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I2&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented cycloisomerization of ynamides is developed, allowing various bis(indole) derivatives in good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope, which not only represents the first molecular iodine&#8208;catalyzed tandem complex alkyne cycloisomerizations but also constitutes the first chemoselective cycloisomerization of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides involving distinctively different C&#8722;C (alkyl) bond cleavage and rearrangement.







Abstract
Herein, an I2&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented cycloisomerization of ynamides is developed, furnishing various functionalized bis(indole) derivatives in generally good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and excellent atom&#8208;economy. This protocol not only represents the first molecular&#8208;iodine&#8208;catalyzed tandem complex alkyne cycloisomerizations, but also constitutes the first chemoselective cycloisomerization of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides involving distinctively different C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage and rearrangement. Moreover, chiral tetrahydropyridine frameworks containing two stereocenters are obtained with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities. Meanwhile, cycloisomerization and aromatization of ynamides produce pyrrolyl indoles with high efficiency enabled by I2. Additionally, control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that this reaction probably undergoes a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/rearrangement process.

         <title>Engineering p&#8208;Band Center of Oxygen Boosting H+ Intercalation in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>

Tuning the &#1013;p of O in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode can effectively increase H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability for aqueous zinc ion batteries. The &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation contribution that describes a volcano curve as a function of &#1013;p, and the best cathode is optimized to be the Cu&#8722;MnO2 among Cu&#8722;, Ni&#8722;, Co&#8722;, Zn&#8722;MnO2.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), the H+ intercalation possesses superior electrochemical kinetics with excellent rate capability, however, precisely modulating H+ intercalation has been still challenging. Herein, a critical modification of pre&#8208;intercalating metal ions in the MnO2 interlayer (M&#8722;MnO2) with controllable p&#8208;band center (&#1013;p) of O is reported to modulate the H+ intercalation. The modulation of metal&#8208;O bond type and covalency degree on the average charge of O atom results in optimized &#1013;p and H+ adsorption energy for M&#8722;MnO2, thus promoting the balance between H+ adsorption and desorption, which plays a determinant role on H+ intercalation. The optimized Cu&#8722;MnO2 delivers superior rate capability with the capacity of 153&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high rate of 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates that &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation, and tuning &#1013;p effectively increases H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability in ZIBs.

         <title>Mechanistic Elucidations of Highly Dispersed Metalloporphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>

PCN&#8208;222(Fe), a metalloporphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), was used for the CO2 electroreduction reaction. The proposed reaction mechanism necessitated catalyst weight loadings of 1&#8197;wt.% to mitigate obfuscations from mass transfer and in situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural and reactive stability of the MOF under operating conditions.







Abstract
Immobilization of porphyrin complexes into crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables high exposure of porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed iron&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (PCN&#8208;222(Fe)) on carbon&#8208;based electrodes revealed optimal turnover frequencies for CO2 electroreduction to CO at 1&#8197;wt.% catalyst loading, beyond which the intrinsic catalyst activity declined due to CO2 mass transport limitations. In situ Raman suggested that PCN&#8208;222(Fe) maintained its structure under electrochemical bias, permitting mechanistic investigations. These revealed a stepwise electron transfer&#8208;proton transfer mechanism for CO2 electroreduction on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) electrodes, which followed a shift from a rate&#8208;limiting electron transfer to CO2 mass transfer as the potential increased from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE. Our results demonstrate how intrinsic catalytic investigations and in situ spectroscopy are needed to elucidate CO2 electroreduction mechanisms on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) MOFs.

         <title>The Alarmone Diadenosine Tetraphosphate as a Cosubstrate for Protein AMPylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ap4A was investigated for its potential applicability as a cosubstrate in AMPylation mediated by FICD, instead of the common cosubstrate ATP. Proficient AMPylation capability of Ap4A was observed, and new potential target proteins were found by chemical proteomics. Interestingly, AMPylation targets of FICD may differ depending on the cosubstrate.







Abstract
Diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnAs) are non&#8208;canonical nucleotides whose cellular concentrations increase during stress and are therefore termed alarmones, signaling homeostatic imbalance. Their cellular role is poorly understood. In this work, we assessed ApnAs for their usage as cosubstrates for protein AMPylation, a post&#8208;translational modification in which adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is transferred to proteins. In humans, AMPylation mediated by the AMPylator FICD with ATP as a cosubstrate is a response to ER stress. Herein, we demonstrate that Ap4A is proficiently consumed for AMPylation by FICD. By chemical proteomics using a new chemical probe, we identified new potential AMPylation targets. Interestingly, we found that AMPylation targets of FICD may differ depending on the nucleotide cosubstrate. These results may suggest that signaling at elevated Ap4A levels during cellular stress differs from when Ap4A is present at low concentrations, allowing response to extracellular cues.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Fast Charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;flammable electrolyte that endows Li&#8208;ion battery with high voltage, wide temperature, and fast charging is developed. Moreover, a new solvation chemistry&#8208;derived dynamic interfacial model, involving the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of electrolyte components on the cathode and anode simultaneously, was presented for the first time to interpret such excellent performance and guide the electrolyte design at a molecular scale.







Abstract
Electrolyte design has become ever more important to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the flammability issue and high reactivity of the conventional electrolytes remain a major problem, especially when the LIBs are operated at high voltage and extreme temperatures. Herein, we design a novel non&#8208;flammable fluorinated ester electrolyte that enables high cycling stability in wide&#8208;temperature variations (e.g., &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C) and superior power capability (fast charge rates up to 5.0&#8197;C) for the graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery at high voltage (i.e., &gt;4.3&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). Moreover, this work sheds new light on the dynamic evolution and interaction among the Li+, solvent, and anion at the molecular level. By elucidating the fundamental relationship between the Li+ solvation structure and electrochemical performance, we can facilitate the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operating in harsh conditions.

         <title>An Arbitrarily Regulated Monomer Sequence in Multi&#8208;Block Copolymer Synthesis by Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of livingness, dual&#8208;initiation, and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enabled the efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers from monomer mixtures of methacrylate and acrylates in a one&#8208;pot process.

Rapid access to sequence&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;block copolymers (multi&#8208;BCPs) remains as a challenging task in the polymer synthesis. Here we employ a Lewis pair (LP) composed of organophosphorus superbase and bulky organoaluminum to effectively copolymerize the mixture of methacrylate, cyclic acrylate, and two acrylates, into well&#8208;defined di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and even a hepta&#8208;BCP in one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step manner. The combined livingness, dual&#8208;initiation and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enable us to achieve not only a trihexaconta&#8208;BCP with the highest record in 8 steps by using four&#8208;component monomer mixture as building blocks, but also the arbitrarily&#8208;regulated monomer sequence in multi&#8208;BCP, simply by changing the composition and adding order of the monomer mixtures, thus demonstrating the powerful capability of our strategy in improving the efficiency and enriching the composition of multi&#8208;BCP synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of livingness, dual-initiation, and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enabled the efficient synthesis of well-defined multi-block copolymers from monomer mixtures of methacrylate and acrylates in a one-pot process. Importantly, monomer sequence can be arbitrarily-regulated by changing the composition and adding order of the monomer mixtures.

         <title>Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Imaging and Laparotomy</title>

Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophores with high chemiluminescence quantum yields were synthesized and developed into an activatable chemiluminescence probe for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging holds potential for sensitive imaging of cancer due to its low background; however, few NIR chemiluminophores are available, which share the drawback of low chemiluminescence quantum yields (&#934;CL). Herein, we report the synthesis of NIR chemiluminophores for cancer imaging and laparotomy. Molecular engineering of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the para&#8208;position of the phenol&#8208;dioxetane leads to a highly bright NIR chemiluminophore (DPT), showing the &#934;CL (4.6&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;Einstein&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that is 3 to 5&#8208;fold higher than existing NIR chemiluminophores. By caging the phenol group of DPT with a cathepsin&#8197;B (CatB) responsive moiety, an activatable chemiluminescence probe (DPTCB) is developed for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice. Due to its high brightness, DPTCB permits accurate chemiluminescence&#8208;guided laparotomy.

         <title>Verifying the Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Using Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of CdS/pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;difluorinated benzothiadiazole (PDB) inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction leads to efficient photocatalytic H2 production coupled with selective 1,2&#8208;diols oxidation. The interfacial S&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer process was explored with transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is flourishing in photocatalysis because it concurrently realizes separated charge carriers and sufficient redox ability. Steady&#8208;state charge transfer has been confirmed by other methods. However, an essential part, the transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, is still missing. To compensate, a series of cadmium sulfide/pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;difluorinated benzothiadiazole heterojunctions were constructed and the photophysical processes were investigated with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Encouragingly, an interfacial charge&#8208;transfer signal was detected in the spectra of the heterojunction, which provides solid evidence for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer to complement the results from well&#8208;established methods. Furthermore, the lifetime for interfacial charge transfer was calculated to be ca. 78.6&#8197;ps. Moreover, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts exhibit higher photocatalytic conversion of 1,2&#8208;diols and H2 production rates than bare cadmium sulfide.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Networks Locking on Inorganic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;curvature two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization is proposed to form a single&#8208;layer 2D polymer network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of nanoparticles for their stabilization and functionalization. The 2D polymer network coated on nanoparticle surfaces can be turned into a non&#8208;contact ligand showing excellent shape retention and high nanoparticle&#8208;surface accessibility.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs), single&#8208;layer networks of covalently linked monomers, show perspectives as membranes and in electronics. However, 2D polymerization of monomers in orthogonal directions limited the formation of 2DPs on nanoparticles (NPs) with high surface curvatures. Here we propose a high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization to form a single&#8208;layer 2DP network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of NPs for their stabilization and functionalization. The high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization of amphiphilic Gemini monomers was conducted in situ on surfaces of NPs with various sizes, shapes, and materials, forming highly cross&#8208;linked 2DPs. Selective etching of core&#8211;shell NPs led to 2DPs as a non&#8208;contact ligand of yolk&#8208;shell structures with excellent shape retention and high NP&#8208;surface accessibility. In addition, by copolymerization, the 2DP ligands can covalently link to other functional molecules. This work promotes the development of 2DPs on NPs for their functional modification.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Phenol with Earth&#8208;abundant Ni&#8722;MoO2 Heterostructured Catalysts: Effect of Oxygen Vacancy on Product Selectivity</title>

Incorporation of MoO2 enhances the catalytic efficiency of Ni in selective electrochemical hydrogenation of phenol in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M H2SO4 solutions. The origin of the superior performance is revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report highly efficient carbon supported Ni&#8722;MoO2 heterostructured catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol in 0.10&#8197;M aqueous sulfuric acid (pH&#8197;0.7) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Highest yields for cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone of 95&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% with faradaic efficiencies of &#8764;50&#8201;% are obtained with catalysts bearing high and low densities of oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites, respectively. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the enhanced phenol adsorption strength is responsible for the superior catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;ol is an important intermediate. Its hydrogenation route and hence the final product are affected by the Ov density. This work opens a promising avenue to the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for the upgrading of phenolic compounds.

         <title>Dibenzomethanopentacene&#8208;Based Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Use in Gas&#8208;Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dibenzomethanopentacene (DBMP) containing polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) were synthesised showing both high performance for pure and mixed gas permeability/selectivity and reduced ageing. The data for DBMP&#8208;rich PIMs are close to the latest Robeson upper bounds for several important gas pairs indicating their potential for making gas separation membranes.







Abstract
Dibenzomethanopentacene (DBMP) is shown to be a useful structural component for making Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) with promise for making efficient membranes for gas separations. DBMP&#8208;based monomers for PIMs are readily prepared using a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between 2,3&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and norbornadiene as the key synthetic step. Compared to date for the archetypal PIM&#8208;1, the incorporation of DBMP simultaneously enhances both gas permeability and the ideal selectivity for one gas over another. Hence, both ideal and mixed gas permeability data for DBMP&#8208;rich co&#8208;polymers and an amidoxime modified PIM are close to the current Robeson upper bounds, which define the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, for several important gas pairs. Furthermore, long&#8208;term studies (over &#8776;3&#8197;years) reveal that the reduction in gas permeabilities on ageing is less for DBMP&#8208;containing PIMs relative to that for other high performing PIMs, which is an attractive property for the fabrication of membranes for efficient gas separations.

         <title>Tuning the CO2 Hydrogenation Selectivity of Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Zirconium Dioxide with Alkali Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping alkali ions (e.g., Na) into Rh1/ZrO2 enables complete switching of the reaction product from CH4 to CO in CO2 hydrogenation over a broad temperature range. It was found that Na+ ions change the surface intermediate from HCOO* to COOH* and render the Rh1 atoms electron deficient with restrained H2 activation capability and weakened CO adsorption, thus cooperatively boosting CO formation.







Abstract
Tuning the coordination environments of metal single atoms (M1) in single&#8208;atom catalysts has shown large impacts on catalytic activity and stability but often barely on selectivity in thermocatalysis. Here, we report that simultaneously regulating both Rh1 atoms and ZrO2 support with alkali ions (e.g., Na) enables efficient switching of the reaction products from nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 to above 99&#8201;% CO in CO2 hydrogenation in a wide temperature range (240&#8211;440&#8201;&#176;C) along with a record high activity of 9.4&#8197;molCO&#8201;gRh&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 300&#8201;&#176;C and long&#8208;term stability. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations unveil that alkali ions on ZrO2 change the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species during CO2 activation, thus leading to exclusive CO formation. Meanwhile, alkali ions also reinforce the electronic Rh1&#8208;support interactions, endowing the Rh1 atoms more electron deficient, which improves the stability against sintering and inhibits deep hydrogenation of CO to CH4.

         <title>Fluorogenic Granzyme A Substrates Enable Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Adaptive Immune Cell Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe NIR fluorogenic substrates for granzyme A with rapid responses and enzyme sensitivity at physiological levels. We demonstrate that these probes can be used for real&#8208;time imaging of CTLs and NK cells in co&#8208;cultures with cancer cells and in ex vivo tissues, opening new avenues to monitor the functions of the immune system in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Cytotoxic immune cells, including T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, are essential components of the host response against tumors. CTLs and NK cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) upon recognition of cancer cells; however, there are very few tools that can detect physiological levels of active GzmA with high spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we report the rational design of the near&#8208;infrared fluorogenic substrates for human GzmA and mouse GzmA. These activity&#8208;based probes display very high catalytic efficiency and selectivity over other granzymes, as shown in tissue lysates from wild&#8208;type and GzmA knock&#8208;out mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the probes can image how adaptive immune cells respond to antigen&#8208;driven recognition of cancer cells in real time.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent MxAl3 Cluster Salts with Tetrahedral [SiAl3]+ and Trigonal&#8208;Bipyramidal [M2Al3]2+ Cores (M=Si/Ge)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive tetrahedral [Cp*Si(AlCp*)3]+ cation is prepared as its aluminate salts starting from Jutzi's [SiCp*]+ cation and Schn&#246;ckel's [(AlCp*)4]. Owing to its good accessibility, [SiAl3]+ can act as starting point towards the synthesis of low&#8208;valent silicon&#8208;doped aluminium&#8208;cluster cores as shown by the preparation of the larger [Si2(AlCp*)5]2+ cluster cation.







Abstract
Schn&#246;ckel's [(AlCp*)4] and Jutzi's [SiCp*][B(C6F5)4] (Cp*=C5Me5) are landmarks in modern main&#8208;group chemistry with diverse applications in synthesis and catalysis. Despite the isoelectronic relationship between the AlCp* and the [SiCp*]+ fragments, their mutual reactivity is hitherto unknown. Here, we report on their reaction giving the complex salts [Cp*Si(AlCp*)3][WCA] ([WCA]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The tetrahedral [SiAl3]+ core not only represents a rare example of a low&#8208;valent silicon&#8208;doped aluminium&#8208;cluster, but also&#8212;due to its facile accessibility and high stability&#8212;provides a convenient preparative entry towards low&#8208;valent Si&#8722;Al clusters in general. For example, an elusive binuclear [Si2(AlCp*)5]2+ with extremely short Al&#8722;Si bonds and a high negative partial charge at the Si atoms was structurally characterised and its bonding situation analysed by DFT. Crystals of the isostructural [Ge2(AlCp*)5]2+ dication were also obtained and represent the first mixed Al&#8722;Ge cluster.

A polythiophene (PT) with the ability of self&#8208;adaptive re&#8208;organization is used for the cathode of aluminum ion battery. The polymerization mode can change from C&#945;&#8722;C&#945; (&#945;&#8208;PT) to C&#946;&#8722;C&#946; (&#946;&#8208;PT) which makes the PT obtain fast kinetics and small steric hindrance. PT cathode achieves a high capacity and super long cycle life of 100&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have attracted great attentions in recent years. Organic materials such as polythiophene (PT) are promising cathode for AIBs. However, the capacity and cyclic stability of conventional organic cathode such as PT are limited by the inadequate degree of reaction and the unstable nature of organic materials. To obtain high&#8208;performance organic cathode, a new PT with the ability of self&#8208;adaptive re&#8208;organization was prepared. During cycling, its molecular chain can be re&#8208;organized, and the polymerization mode will change from C&#945;&#8722;C&#945; (&#945;&#8208;PT) to C&#946;&#8722;C&#946; (&#946;&#8208;PT). This change leads to smaller steric hindrance and faster kinetics during ion insertion which can lower the reaction energy barrier and stabilize the molecular structure. Benefited by this, AIBs with this cathode can deliver a specific capacity of 180&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (@2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a superb stability of 100&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. High energy density and power density can also be achieved with this cathode.

         <title>Reactivity and Recyclability of Ligand&#8208;Protected Metal Cluster Catalysts for CO2 Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;protected metal clusters composed of silver, gold, and copper integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and exhibit an excellent reactivity and recyclability for CO2 formylation with secondary amines. Fundamental insights are provided into the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction and design rules are presented for preparation of metal clusters with high stability and recyclability.







Abstract
It remains a significant challenge to construct an integrated catalyst that combines advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with clarified mechanism and high performance. Here we show atomically precise CuAg cluster catalysts for CO2 capture and utilization, where two functional units are combined into the clusters: metal and ligand. Due to atomic resolution on total and local structures of such catalysts to be achieved, which disentangles heterogeneous imprecise systems and permits tracing the reaction processes via experiments coupled with theory, site&#8208;specific catalysis induced by metal&#8208;ligand synergy can be accurately elucidated. The CuAg cluster catalysts exhibit excellent reactivity and recyclability to forge the C&#8722;N bonding from CO2 formylation with secondary amines that can make the cluster catalysts more unique compared with typically homogeneous complexes.

         <title>Visualizing the Intermittent Gating of Na+/H+ Antiporters in Single Native Bioluminescent Bacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the observation of the intermittent BL blinking of a single bioluminescent bacterium. This study not only demonstrated, for the first time, the intermittent gating dynamics of NhaA antiporters in single native bacteria without any genetic engineering or chemical labeling, but also opened the door for P.&#8197;phosphoreum to serve as model bacteria for reporting the physiological and metabolic status with spontaneous BL emission.







Abstract
While the intermittent gating of ion channels has been well studied for decades, dynamics of the action of secondary transporters, another major pathway for ion transmembrane transports, remains largely unexplored in living cells. Herein, intermittent blinking of the spontaneous bioluminescence (BL) from single native bacteria, P. phosphoreum, was reported, investigated and attributed to the intermittent gating of sodium/proton antiporters (NhaA) between the active and inactive conformations. Each gating event caused the rapid depolarization and recovery of membrane potential within several seconds, accompanying with the apparent BL blinking due to the transient inhibitions on the activity of the respiratory chain. Temperature&#8208;dependent measurements further obtained an activation energy barrier of the conformational change of 20.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Thermodynamic Control of Intramolecular Singlet Fission and Exciton Transport in Linear Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of newly synthesized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers are presented. The molecular design strategy achieves efficient exciton transport in linear tetracene oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling a sequential exciton trapping process by intramolecular singlet fission.







Abstract
We newly synthesized a series of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers to propose a molecular design strategy for the efficient exciton transport in linear oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling sequential exciton trapping process of individual doubled triplet excitons (T+T) by intramolecular singlet fission. First, entropic gain effects on the number of Tc units are examined by comparing Tc&#8208;homo&#8208;oligomers [(Tc)n: n=2, 4, 6]. Then, a comparison of (Tc)n and Tc&#8208;hetero&#8208;oligomer [TcF3&#8208;(Tc)4&#8208;TcF3] reveals the vibronic coupling effect for entropic gain. Observed entropic effects on the T+T formation indicated that the exciton migration is rationalized by number of possible TT states increased both by increasing the number of Tc units and by the vibronic levels at the terminal TcF3 units. Finally, we successfully observed high&#8208;yield exciton trapping process (trapped triplet yield: &#934;TrT=176&#8201;%).

A deep blue boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped nonacene emitter that shows multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) is described. The emitter shows bright, deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission in an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device.







Abstract
We present a p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped nonacene compound, NOBNacene, that represents a rare example of a linearly extended ladder&#8208;type multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. This compound shows efficient narrow deep blue emission, with a &#955;PL of 410&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum, FWHM, of 38&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;PL of 71&#8201;%, and a delayed lifetime, &#964;d of 1.18&#8197;ms in 1.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% TSPO1 thin film. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) using this compound as the emitter shows a comparable electroluminescence spectrum peaked at 409&#8197;nm (FWHM=37&#8197;nm) and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 8.5&#8201;% at Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.173, 0.055). The EQEmax values were increased to 11.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% doping of the emitter within the emissive layer of the device. At this concentration, the electroluminescence spectrum broadened slightly, leading to CIE coordinates of (0.176, 0.068).

The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) using this compound as the emitter shows a comparable electroluminescence spectrum peaked at 409&#8197;nm (FWHM=37&#8197;nm) and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 8.5&#8201;% at Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.173, 0.055). The EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values were increased to 11.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% doping of the emitter within the emissive layer of the device. At this concentration, the electroluminescence spectrum broadened slightly, leading to CIE coordinates of (0.176, 0.068).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;entity Electrochemistry Unveils Dynamic Transformation during Tandem Catalysis of Cu2O and Co3O4 for Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational catalyst design strategy is vital for a highly efficient conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst exhibit a much higher NH3 yield rate than the single component alone. More importantly, we confirmed tandem catalysis by placing individual single Cu2O and Co3O4 on carbon nanoelectrode. Using single&#8208;entity electrochemistry and identical&#8208;location TEM we unveiled the dynamic transformation caused by tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate to ammonia is an essential and sustainable approach to restoring the globally perturbed nitrogen cycle. The rational design of catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) based on a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is of high significance. We report a Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst which enhances the NH3 production rate by &#8776;2.7&#8208;fold compared to Co3O4 and &#8776;7.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu2O, respectively, however, most importantly, we precisely place single Cu2O and Co3O4 cube&#8208;shaped nanoparticles individually and together on carbon nanoelectrodes provide insight into the mechanism of the tandem catalysis. The structural and phase evolution of the individual Cu2O+Co3O4 nanocubes during NO3RR is unveiled using identical location transmission electron microscopy. Combining single&#8208;entity electrochemistry with precise nano&#8208;placement sheds light on the dynamic transformation of single catalyst particles during tandem catalysis in a direct way.

         <title>Circular Upcycling of Bottlebrush Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Built&#8208;in circularity can be achieved by integrating closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling in brush&#8208;like thermosets with dynamic crosslinks.







Abstract
The inability to re&#8208;process thermosets hinders their utility and sustainability. An ideal material should combine closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling capabilities. This trait is realized in polydimethylsiloxane bottlebrush networks using thermoreversible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to enable both reversible disassembly into a polymer melt and on&#8208;demand reconfiguration to an elastomer of either lower or higher stiffness. The crosslink density was tuned by loading the functionalized networks with a controlled fraction of dormant crosslinkers and crosslinker scavengers, such as furan&#8208;capped bis&#8208;maleimide and anthracene, respectively. The resulting modulus variations precisely followed the stoichiometry of activated furan and maleimide moieties, demonstrating the lack of side reactions during reprocessing. The presented circularity concept is independent from the backbone or side chain chemistry, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of brush&#8208;like polymers.

         <title>Mechanical Training Enabled Reinforcement of Polyrotaxane&#8208;Containing Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel was constructed through one&#8208;pot photo&#8208;initiated copolymerization. Naphthotube can slide along the PEG chain upon repeated stretching. The slide motion further induces the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form compact hydrogen bonded nanocrystalline domains through integrated hydrogen bonds, which enabled the hydrogel to achieve reinforcement.







Abstract
Many strategies have been developed for constructing anisotropic hydrogels, however, it remains a challenge to fabricate hydrogels with anisotropic nanocrystalline domains from intrinsically soft networks. Here, we report a naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel that can be reinforced via mechanical training. During the training process, the hydrogel can adopt reorientation of polymer chains to form anisotropic structures driven by external uniaxial force. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding sites and movable feature of naphthotube, the sliding of naphthotube on PEG chains simultaneously inducing the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form densely anisotropic nanocrystalline domains through hydrogen bonded networks. Thus, the trained hydrogel exhibits an enhanced tension stress of &#8776;110&#8197;kPa, which realize a remarkable enhancement of &#8776;10&#8197;times compare to initial state. This study provides a new tactic for improving the mechanical performance of soft materials.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Segregated Stacking Structure with Anisotropic Electric Conductivity in NIR&#8208;Absorbing and Emitting Positively Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>

Ordered arrangements and resulting anion&#8208;dependent photophysical properties were observed in the dispersed&#8208; and solid&#8208;state ion pairs of squarylium&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electronic cation with an augmented dipole. A completely charge&#8208;segregated assembly was formed in the ion pair with a &#960;&#8208;electronic anion, exhibiting solid&#8208;state photophysical properties and anisotropic electric conductivity according to the stacking structure.







Abstract
Squarylium&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electronic cation with an augmented dipole was synthesized by methylation of zwitterionic squarylium. The cation formed various ion pairs in combination with anions, and the ion pairs exhibited distinct photophysical properties in the dispersed state, ascribed to the formation of J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates. The ion pairs provided solid&#8208;state assemblies based on cation stacking. It is noteworthy that complete segregation of cations and anions was observed in a pseudo&#8208;polymorph of the ion pair with pentacyanocyclopentadienide as a &#960;&#8208;electronic anion. In the crystalline state, the ion pairs exhibited photophysical properties and electric conductivity derived from cation stacking. In particular, the charge&#8208;segregated ion&#8208;pairing assembly induces an electric conductive pathway along the stacking axis. The charge&#8208;segregated mode and fascinating properties were derived from the reduced electrostatic repulsion between adjacent &#960;&#8208;electronic cations via dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.

Two highly robust microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks with high ethane uptake and selectivity, ultrahigh water stability, high chemical stability, and low ethane/ethene adsorption enthalpy were designed and synthesized, which could realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from binary C2H6/C2H4 mixtures under both dry and humid conditions.







Abstract
Two C2H6&#8208;selective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents with ultrahigh stability, high surface areas, and suitable pore size have been designed and synthesized for one&#8208;step separation of ethane/ethylene (C2H6/C2H4) under humid conditions to produce polymer&#8208;grade pure C2H4. Experimental results reveal that these two MOFs not only adsorb a high amount of C2H6 but also display good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity verified by fixed bed column breakthrough experiments. Most importantly, the good water stability and hydrophobic pore environments make these two MOFs capable of efficiently separating C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions, exhibiting the benchmark performance among all reported adsorbents for separation of C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions. Moreover, the affinity sites and their static adsorption energies were successfully revealed by single crystal data and computation studies. Adsorbents described in this work can be used to address major chemical industrial challenges.

         <title>Altering Oxygen Binding by Redox&#8208;Inactive Metal Substitution to Control Catalytic Activity: Oxygen Reduction on Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles as a Model System
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted manganese oxide nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M, were studied as a model system to generalize the electronic effect of redox&#8208;inactive substituents on the electrocatalytic activity of the oxides. The oxygen reduction activity of Mn3O4:M correlates with the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ site. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of materials that influence their performance will advance the rational engineering of new catalytic materials. In this study, by investigating metal&#8208;substituted manganese oxide (spinel) nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M (M=Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), we rationalize the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide, &#916;fH&#176;(MO), and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M with low &#916;fH&#176;(MO) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which affects its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis relying on the rational substitution/doping by redox&#8208;inactive elements.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Difunctionalization of Sulfur Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free difunctionalization of bench&#8208;stable sulfur salts gives facile access to iodo&#8208;substituted sulfides using either diaryliodonium or vinyliodonium salts. The methodology was extended to one&#8208;pot syntheses of electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and efficient late&#8208;stage transformations of medicinally important compounds.







Abstract
Efficient protocols for accessing iodo&#8208;substituted diaryl and aryl(vinyl) sulfides have been developed using iodonium salts as reactive electrophilic arylation and vinylation reagents. The reactions take place under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, employing odorless and convenient sulfur reagents. A wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the S&#8208;diarylation, enabling the regioselective late&#8208;stage application of several heterocycles and drug molecules under mild reaction conditions. A novel S&#8208;difunctionalization pathway was discovered using vinyliodonium salts, which proceeds under additive&#8208;free reaction conditions and grants excellent stereoselectivity in the synthesis of aryl(vinyl) sulfides. A one&#8208;pot strategy combining transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free diarylation and subsequent reduction provided facile access to electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and a direct synthesis of a potential drug candidate derivative. The retained iodo group allows a wide array of further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic insights were elucidated by isolating the key intermediate, and the relevant energy profile was substantiated by DFT calculations.

A rapid water adsorption/desorption process with low energy consumption was achieved in the nano&#8208;confined channels of CPOS&#8208;6. The confined water can be regarded as a molecular superfluid.







Abstract
White et&#8197;al., in a recent Correspondence, provided additional structural data to illustrate that CPOS&#8208;6 undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation during water adsorption/desorption. This finding gave a better understanding of the relevant experimental phenomena from the perspective of structural transformation and is a good complement to our previous results. However, we wish to emphasize that our research focuses on the kinetic behavior of water during ultrafast adsorption/desorption in nano&#8208;confined channels. Herein, we further interpret the rapid transport of water molecules in the nano&#8208;confined channels from the perspective of superfluidity.

In this Correspondence, we show that the rapid and cyclable atmospheric water harvesting processes in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) recently reported by Ben and co&#8208;workers involve massive structural rearrangement. Adsorption and desorption of water causes motion of the entire framework in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal manner.







Abstract
In a recent Research Article, Ben and co&#8208;workers reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework prepared from a 4+ tetra&#8208;amidinium component and a 4&#8722; tetra&#8208;sulfonate component, termed CPOS&#8208;6. They showed that CPOS&#8208;6 could reversibly adsorb and desorb water over a narrow humidity window, and that this material offered potential for applications in atmospheric water harvesting. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed the material was stable over 50 adsorption/desorption cycles and that the kinetics of these cycles were very rapid. In this Correspondence we present additional structural data regarding this framework in both its hydrated and dehydrated states and thus discern the mechanism of water binding. These data do not disagree with Ben and co&#8208;workers&#8217; findings: rather they emphasise how remarkable the cyclability and rapid kinetics of adsorption/desorption are, as these processes involve a complete crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal rearrangement of the framework.

Reversible handedness inversion is achieved in self&#8208;organized helical superstructures using a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven macrocyclic chiral switch, as reported by Quan Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202216600). Green and blue light can drive the reversible switching between left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness via the reversible cis/trans photoisomerization of azobenzene within the cyclic molecular switch.

Programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits, which, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor, were designed by Sara Bracaglia, Simona Ranallo, and Francesco Ricci in their Research Article (e202216512). The cell&#8208;free electrochemical biosensor allows the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum.

         <title>Inside Cover: Altering Oxygen Binding by Redox&#8208;Inactive Metal Substitution to Control Catalytic Activity: Oxygen Reduction on Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles as a Model System (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2023)</title>

Redox&#8208;inactive substituents steer the activity of manganese oxide nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M, in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In their Research Article (e202217186), Denis Kuznetsov, Christoph M&#252;ller, and co&#8208;workers describe how the ORR activity of Mn3O4:M correlates with the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M site. The work generalizes the role of redox&#8208;inactive elements in influencing the kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions and provides a perspective on the design of new catalyst compositions.

         <title>Back Cover: Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic Cooperativity Through a Hydrogen Bonding Spacer in CO2 Reduction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the active site of CO dehydrogenase, a metalloporphyrin&#8208;based mimic has been synthesized combining a multipoint hydrogen bond donor and a bimetallic active centre, as reported by Zakaria Halime, Ally Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202214665). The cooperativity between the two metal centres of the catalyst was shown for both homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic analogues, leading to a significant enhancement of the catalytic performance in the heterogeneous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction.

         <title>Single Platinum Atom Catalysts with High Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Qiao and co&#8208;workers recently designed and interpreted the construction of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms in the Co3O4 host with inter&#8208;site interactions via the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base principle and further revealed the dynamic structure evolution process of the single atom sites by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical computation.







Abstract
As a new frontier, the rapid development of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in heterogeneous catalysis has attracted extensive attention. However, a fundamental understanding of the dynamic formation process of active metal atom sites is lacking. The rational design of high&#8208;performance SACs now becomes possible by explicitly addressing the conundrum of constructing high&#8208;density SACs and elucidating the evolution of SACs during the synthesis.

         <title>Mechanisms and Synthetic Strategies in Visible Light&#8208;Driven [2+2]&#8208;Heterocycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between alkenes and carbonyls is a formidable strategy for the synthesis of complex strained 3D architectures. This Review provides an overview on the recent development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions driven by visible light. The diverse synthetic approaches are presented with special emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms along with possible future directions of the field.







Abstract
The synthesis of four membered heterocycles usually requires multi&#8208;step procedures and prefunctionalized reactants. A straightforward alternative is the photochemical [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between an alkene and a carbonyl derivative, conventionally based on the photoexcitation of this latter. However, this approach is limited by the absorption profile of the carbonyl, requiring in most of the cases the use of high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;light, that often results in undesired side reactions and/or the degradation of the reaction components. The development of new and milder visible light&#8208;driven [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions is, therefore, highly desirable. In this Review, we highlight the most relevant achievements in the development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions promoted by visible light, with a particular emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms. The open challenges will also be discussed, suggesting new possible evolutions, and stimulating new methodological developments in the field.

         <title>Caught in Action: Visualizing Dynamic Nanostructures Within Supramolecular Systems Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As supramolecular chemistry begins to develop dynamic nanostructures that change over time, it becomes imperative to visualize self&#8208;assembly processes in solution in real&#8208;time. Our Review demonstrates how solution&#8208;based visualization techniques, namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, atomic force and electron microscopy in liquid, and molecular dynamics simulations, have enriched our understanding of nanomaterials to obtain novel functions.







Abstract
Supramolecular systems chemistry has been an area of active research to develop nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. Progress in systems chemistry relies on our ability to probe the nanostructure formation in solution. Often visualizing the dynamics of nanostructures which transform over time is a formidable challenge. This necessitates a paradigm shift from dry sample imaging towards solution&#8208;based techniques. We review the application of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques for real&#8208;time, in situ visualization of dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes. We present how solution&#8208;based techniques namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, solution&#8208;state atomic force microscopy, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and other emerging techniques are revolutionizing our understanding of active and adaptive nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. This Review provides the visualization toolbox and futuristic vision to tap the potential of dynamic nanomaterials.

         <title>Emerging Materials for Interfacial Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on solar&#8208;driven water purification has grown rapidly over the past years and emerging materials such as polymers, MOFs and COFs have been employed in this field recently. This minireview gives an overview of the basic concepts and principles for solar evaporation systems and on the development of novel photothermal materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water purification is considered as an effective and sustainable technology for water treatment using green solar energy. One major goal for practical applications is to improve the solar evaporation performance by the design of novel photothermal materials, with optimized heat localization and water transport pathways to achieve reduced energy consumption for water vaporization. Recently, some emerging materials like polymers, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and also single molecules were employed to construct novel solar evaporation systems. In this minireview, we present an overview of the recent efforts on materials development for water purification systems. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of these emerging materials for solar&#8208;driven water treatment, including desalination, wastewater purification, sterilization and energy production, are also summarized.

Recently, some emerging materials like polymers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and also single molecules were employed to construct novel solar evaporation systems. In this minireview, we present an overview of the recent efforts on materials development for water purification systems. The state-of-the-art applications of these emerging materials for solar-driven water treatment, including desalination, wastewater purification, sterilization and energy production, are also summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts to boost tin halide perovskite optoelectronics have focused heavily on the instability of SnII, while other inconspicuous chemical processes have remained unexplored. This Minireview highlights the key role of native halide chemistry in the stability, device performance, ecological impact and prospects for visible light emission in this class of materials. Halide management routes towards viable optoelectronics are also proposed.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead&#8208;free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn2+ to Sn4+ remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its influence on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution for improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.

         <title>Olefin Dihydroxylation Using Nitroarenes as Photoresponsive Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcited nitroarenes ca be used, in conjunction with Pd&#8208;mediated hydrogenation, as osmium surrogates for olefin dihydroxylation.







Abstract
Vicinal diols are abundant among natural and synthetic molecules, and also represent valuable intermediates throughout organic synthesis. Olefin dihydroxylation is an effective strategy to access these derivatives owing to the broad range and availability of alkene feedstocks. OsO4 is among the most used reagents to achieve this transformation, yet its high toxicity and cost remain concerning. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy for olefin dihydroxylation using nitroarenes as photoresponsive oxidants. Upon purple LEDs irradiation, these species undergo a [3+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition with a wide range of olefins to give stable 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine intermediates. These species can be accumulated in solution and then reduced in situ to the desired diols, utilising readily accessible and easy to handle solid reagents as H2 surrogates.

         <title>Synthetic K+ Channels Constructed by Rebuilding the Core Modules of Natural K+ Channels in an Artificial System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in an artificial system has led to a biomimetic K+ channel. This channel possesses similar structural features as the natural version, which enables it to replicate the transport behavior and biological function of natural K+ channels.







Abstract
Different types of natural K+ channels share similar core modules and cation permeability characteristics. In this study, we have developed novel artificial K+ channels by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems. All the channels displayed high selectivity for K+ over Na+ and exhibited a selectivity sequence of K+&#8776;Rb+ during the transport process, which is highly consistent with the cation permeability characteristics of natural K+ channels. More importantly, these artificial channels could be efficiently inserted into cell membranes and mediate the transmembrane transport of K+, disrupting the cellular K+ homeostasis and eventually triggering the apoptosis of cells. These findings demonstrate that, by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems, the structures, transport behaviors, and physiological functions of natural K+ channels can be mimicked in synthetic channels.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic Cooperativity Through a Hydrogen Bonding Spacer in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the active site of CO dehydrogenase (CODH), a novel metalloporphyrin&#8208;based mimic has been synthesized combining a multipoint hydrogen bond donor and a bimetallic active centre. The cooperativity between the two metal centres of the catalyst was evidenced for both homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic analogues leading to a significant enhancement of the catalytic performances of the heterogeneous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction in water.







Abstract
At the core of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) active site two metal ions together with hydrogen bonding scheme from amino acids orchestrate the interconversion between CO2 and CO. We have designed a molecular catalyst implementing a bimetallic iron complex with an embarked second coordination sphere with multi&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. We found that, when immobilized on carbon paper electrode, the dinuclear catalyst enhances up to four fold the heterogeneous CO2 reduction to CO in water with an improved selectivity and stability compared to the mononuclear analogue. Interestingly, quasi&#8208;identical catalytic performances are obtained when one of the two iron centers was replaced by a redox inactive Zn metal, questioning the cooperative action of the two metals. Snapshots of X&#8208;ray structures indicate that the two metalloporphyrin units tethered by a urea group is a good compromise between rigidity and flexibility to accommodate CO2 capture, activation, and reduction.

         <title>Diethylzinc&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions between Dibromoketones and Monobromo Carbonyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds.







Abstract
A novel route to synthesize 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dibromoketones generate zinc enolates through a diethylzinc&#8208;mediated halogen&#8208;metal exchange and react with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds to furnish 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via a second generation of zinc enolates. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds. Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes using a chiral secondary amine catalyst and a subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reaction between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoacetophenones.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C1,N&#8208;Dipolar (3+2) Cycloadditions of 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cations with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binuclear copper&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations with indoles was achieved. This transformation featured a unique C1,N&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactivity for 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations. Enantioenriched pyrroloindoline derivatives were prepared by this cycloaddition in high yields with good enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminoallyl cations are versatile 1,3&#8208;dipoles that could potentially be used for diverse (3+n) cycloaddition reactions. Despite some preliminary studies, the asymmetric catalytic transformation of these species is still underdeveloped. We herein report a binuclear copper&#8208;catalyzed generation of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations from ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates and their enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition reaction with indoles to construct chiral pyrroloindolines. This transformation features a novel C1,N&#8208;dipolar reactivity for 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations.

         <title>Influence of Side Chain Conformation on the Activity of Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental demonstration that preorganization of inhibitor side chain conformation can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition is reported. By strategic installation of a methyl group at C6, a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche side chain conformation was found to be a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin.







Abstract
Substrate side chain conformation impacts reactivity during glycosylation and glycoside hydrolysis and is restricted by many glycosidases and glycosyltransferases during catalysis. We show that the side chains of gluco and manno iminosugars can be restricted to predominant conformations by strategic installation of a methyl group. Glycosidase inhibition studies reveal that iminosugars with the gauche,gauche side chain conformations are 6&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more potent than isosteric compounds with the gauche,trans conformation; a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche conformation is a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic benefits of preorganization, particularly when in synergy with favorable hydrophobic interactions. The demonstration that inhibitor side chain preorganization can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition paves the way for improved inhibitor design through conformational preorganization.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Mapping of Membrane Proteins on Synaptic Vesicles using Spectrally Encoded Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We used the intensity ratio of the first and second vibronic peaks of semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) to correlate photoswitching events. Multi&#8208;fold localization precision enhancement was achieved by averaging over switching events from the same Pdot. This method was used to count and map two membrane proteins on synaptic vesicles.







Abstract
The spatial resolution of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy is limited by the photon number of a single switching event because of the difficulty of correlating switching events dispersed in time. Here we overcome this limitation by developing a new class of photoswitching semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) with structured and highly dispersed single&#8208;particle spectra. We imaged the Pdots at the first and the second vibronic emission peaks and used the ratio of peak intensities as a spectral coding. By correlating switching events using the spectral coding and performing 4&#8211;9 frame binning, we achieved a 2&#8211;3 fold experimental resolution improvement versus conventional superresolution imaging. We applied this method to count and map SV2 and proton ATPase proteins on synaptic vesicles (SVs). The results reveal that these proteins are trafficked and organized with high precision, showing unprecedented level of detail about the composition and structure of SVs.

Here we report an efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused heteropine compounds and investigated their optical and electronic properties. A &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused thiepine exhibited a &#8220;pitched &#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; structure in the crystal, and exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds have been used as building blocks for numerous organic semiconductors over the past few decades. While the success is based on thiophene&#8208;containing compounds, aromatic compounds that contain thiepine, a sulfur&#8208;containing seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring arene, has been less well investigated. Here we report the synthesis and properties of &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused heteropine compounds such as thiepine and oxepine. A &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused thiepine exhibited a &#8220;pitched &#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; structure in the crystal, and exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>SASSY NMR: Simultaneous Solid and Solution Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
SASSY NMR is a novel 2&#8208;in&#8208;1 technique capable of observing solid and solution phases simultaneously. Gel&#8208;like material appears in both fractions with a distribution proportional to the rigidity of the C&#8722;H dipoles. SASSY is advantageous when monitoring processes involving multiphase changes, as traditional sequential solid and solution NMR can miss rapid fluctuations. SASSY is easy to use, time efficient and can be applied universally.







Abstract
Synergism between different phases gives rise to chemical, biological or environmental reactivity, thus it is increasingly important to study samples intact. Here, SASSY (SimultAneous Solid and Solution spectroscopY) is introduced to simultaneously observe (and differentiate) all phases in multiphase samples using standard, solid&#8208;state NMR equipment. When monitoring processes, the traditional approach of studying solids and liquids sequentially, can lead to information in the non&#8208;observed phase being missed. SASSY solves this by observing the full range of materials, from crystalline solids, through gels, to pure liquids, at full sensitivity in every scan. Results are identical to running separate 13C CP&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state and 13C solution&#8208;state experiments back&#8208;to&#8208;back but requires only a fraction of the spectrometer time. After its introduction, SASSY is applied to process monitoring and finally to detect all phases in a living freshwater shrimp. SASSY is simple to implement and thus should find application across all areas of research.

&lt;p&gt;Synergism between different phases gives rise to chemical, biological or environmental reactivity, thus it is increasingly important to study samples intact. Here, SASSY (SimultAneous Solid and Solution spectroscopY) is introduced to simultaneously observe (and differentiate) all phases in multiphase samples using standard, solid-state NMR equipment. When monitoring processes, the traditional approach of studying solids and liquids sequentially, can lead to information in the non-observed phase being missed. SASSY solves this by observing the full range of materials, from crystalline solids, through gels, to pure liquids, at full sensitivity in every scan. Results are identical to running separate &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C CP-MAS solid-state and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C solution-state experiments back-to-back but requires only a fraction of the spectrometer time. After its introduction, SASSY is applied to process monitoring and finally to detect all phases in a living freshwater shrimp. SASSY is simple to implement and thus should find application across all areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Highly Controlled and Efficient Polymerization of Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordinative chain transfer polymerization permits the controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene, currently the most important monomer for plastic production. The key to the combination of control, very high activity, and an excellent catalyst economy seems to be a Group 4 metal complex stabilized by only one bulky and strongly bound monoanionic ligand. NH+B&#8722;=N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylanilinium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate.







Abstract
The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene is a very attractive but challenging target. Herein we report on a Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization catalyst, which combines a high degree of control and very high activity in ethylene oligo&#8208; or polymerization with extremely high chain transfer agent (triethylaluminum) to catalyst ratios (catalyst economy). Our Zr catalyst is long living and temperature stable. The chain length of the polyethylene products increases over time under constant ethylene feed or until a certain volume of ethylene is completely consumed to reach the expected molecular weight. Very high activities are observed if the catalyst elongates 60&#8201;000 or more alkyl chains and the polydispersity of the strictly linear polyethylene materials obtained are very low. The key for the combination of high control and efficiency seems to be a catalyst stabilized by only one strongly bound monoanionic N&#8208;ligand.

         <title>Unimer Exchange Is not Necessary for Morphological Transitions in Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that morphological transitions during radical RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in water do not require unimer exchanges. The monomer present in the polymerization medium enables morphological transitions although it unexpectedly slows down unimer exchange.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has established itself as a powerful and straightforward method to produce polymeric nano&#8208;objects of various morphologies in (aqueous) solution. Generally, spheres are formed in the early stages of polymerization that may evolve to higher order morphologies (worms or vesicles), as the solvophobic block grows during polymerization. Hitherto, the mechanisms involved in these morphological transitions during PISA are still not well understood. Combining a systematic study of a representative PISA system with rheological measurements, we demonstrate that&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;unimer exchange is not necessary to form higher order morphologies during radical RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA. Instead, in the investigated aqueous PISA, the monomer present in the polymerization medium is responsible for the morphological transitions, even though it slows down unimer exchange.

         <title>A Homochiral Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based Membrane for Efficient Enantioselective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based membranes (S&#8208;PdMeOx/GO) are prepared via a simple solution&#8208;based method on porous substrates for chiral separation. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based network within the graphene oxide scaffold induced homochirality in the membrane. The resulting S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane displays excellent enantioselectivity in separating racemic limonene mixtures.







Abstract
Chiral separation membranes have shown great potential for the efficient separation of racemic mixtures into enantiopure components for many applications, such as in the food and pharmaceutical industries; however, scalable fabrication of membranes with both high enantioselectivity and flux remains a challenge. Herein, enantiopure S&#8208;poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (S&#8208;PdMeOx) macromonomers were synthesized and used to prepare a new type of enantioselective membrane consisting of a chiral S&#8208;PdMeOx network scaffolded by graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane showed a near&#8208;quantitative enantiomeric excess (ee) (98.3&#177;1.7&#8201;%) of S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;limonene over R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene and a flux of 0.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the potential of homochiral poly(2,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)s in chiral discrimination and provides a new route to the development of highly efficient enantioselective membranes using synthetic homochiral polymer networks.

         <title>Step by Step Induced Growth of Zinc&#8208;Metal Interface on Graphdiyne for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradually inducing an increase in size from atoms to nanoflat surfaces shows the great power of the conjugated, multi&#8208;pore structure of graphdiyne (GDY). An electrode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries obtained by anchoring Zn atoms on graphdiyne shows excellent electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) promise high energy density, low redox potential, low cost and safety; however, their cycle performances are seriously insufficient to restrict the progress in this field. We propose a new concept of atomic electrode formed on the graphdiyne (GDY). This new idea electrode was synthesized by selectively, uniformly, and stably anchoring Zn atoms on GDY at the beginning of plating. The Zn atoms are induced to grow into larger size Zn clusters, which continue to grow into nanoflat. Finally, a new heterojunction interface is formed on GDY without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities. Such stepwise induction of growth greatly suppresses the formation of Zn dendrites, resulting in high electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan of AZIBs.

         <title>A Triply Negatively Charged Nanographene Bilayer with Spin Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triply negatively charged radical species based on a bilayer of a C96 nanographene was synthesized and characterized. It is stabilized as an open&#8208;shell doublet ground state with an excited quartet state. It is the largest well&#8208;defined open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of a triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Spin frustration is observed in this species.







Abstract
We report on the largest open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Upon three&#8208;electron reduction, bilayer nanographene fragment molecule (C96H24Ar6)2 (Ar=2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl) (12) was transformed to a triply negatively charged species 123.&#8722;, which has been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic properties on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). 123.&#8722; features a 96&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (96c/3e) pancake bond with a doublet ground state, which can be thermally excited to a quartet state. It consists of 34 &#960;&#8208;fused rings with 96 conjugated sp2 carbon atoms.

     alt="A Triply Negatively Charged Nanographene Bilayer with Spin Frustration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A triply negatively charged radical species based on a bilayer of a C&lt;sub&gt;96&lt;/sub&gt; nanographene was synthesized and characterized. It is stabilized as an open-shell doublet ground state with an excited quartet state. It is the largest well-defined open-shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of a triply negatively charged radical &#960;-dimer. Spin frustration is observed in this species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the largest open-shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of triply negatively charged radical &#960;-dimer. Upon three-electron reduction, bilayer nanographene fragment molecule (C&lt;sub&gt;96&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Ar&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ar=2,6-dimethylphenyl) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was transformed to a triply negatively charged species &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which has been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic properties on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; features a 96-center-3-electron (96&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;/3&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;) pancake bond with a doublet ground state, which can be thermally excited to a quartet state. It consists of 34 &#960;-fused rings with 96 conjugated &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon atoms. Spin frustration is observed with the frustration parameter &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;31.8 at low temperatures in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Doping in Flexible Organic Crystals for Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of flexibility and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in an organic single crystal is achieved by the host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The centimeter&#8208;scale crystals can be repeatedly bent and emit deep&#8208;red afterglow. This phenomenon occurs because the guest molecules, as trace impurities, greatly affect the emission properties of the materials, whereas the effect on the molecular packing of the host molecules is negligible.







Abstract
Organic single crystals (OSCs) with excellent flexibility and unique optical properties are of great importance due to their broad applicability in optical/optoelectronic devices and sensors. Nevertheless, fabricating flexible OSCs with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest doping strategy to achieve both RTP and flexibility of OSCs. The single&#8208;stranded crystal is highly bendable upon external force application and can immediately return to its original straight shape after removal of the stress, impressively emitting bright deep&#8208;red phosphorescence. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the bright RTP arises from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the triphenylene molecules to the dopants. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a universal approach for the preparation of flexible OSCs with RTP.

         <title>Anomalously Large Antiphase Signals from Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen Using a MOF&#8208;Based SABRE Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of parahydrogen to particles comprised of an iridium&#8208;based catalyst supported on a metal&#8211;organic framework produces dissolved orthohydrogen, but with a twist: a strongly hyperpolarized state is achieved that is enriched in the T0 sublevel, giving rise to a surprising anti&#8208;phase signal with enhancement up to &#8776;500&#8208;fold and significantly increased hyperpolarization lifetime.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized orthohydrogen (o&#8208;H2) is a frequent product of parahydrogen&#8208;based hyperpolarization approaches like signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE), where the hyperpolarized o&#8208;H2 signal is usually absorptive. We describe a novel manifestation of this effect wherein large antiphase o&#8208;H2 signals are observed, with 1H enhancements up to &#8776;500&#8208;fold (effective polarization PH&#8776;1.6&#8201;%). This anomalous effect is attained only when using an intact heterogeneous catalyst constructed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and is qualitatively independent of substrate nature. This seemingly paradoxical observation is analogous to the &#8220;partial negative line&#8221; (PNL) effect recently explained in the context of Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP) by Ivanov and co&#8208;workers. The two&#8208;spin order of the o&#8208;H2 resonance is manifested by a two&#8208;fold higher Rabi frequency, and the lifetime of the antiphase HP o&#8208;H2 resonance is extended by several&#8208;fold.

Herein, we describe the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;amination of proaromatic dihydroquinazolinones derived from ketone building blocks. The reaction is enabled by the intermediacy of open&#8208;shell species arising from homolytic C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage driven by aromatization. The protocol is characterized by its operational simplicity and generality, including chemical diversification of advanced intermediates.

         <title>Cesium Amide&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8208;H Bonds with D2 and Application for Tritiation of Pharmaceuticals</title>

Cesium amide catalyst establishes a new bridge between benzylic C&#8722;H bonds and D2/T2, facilitating deuteration and tritiation of pharmaceutical compounds.







Abstract
Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) represents one of the most attractive labeling methods to synthesize deuterium&#8208; and tritium&#8208;labeled compounds. Catalytic HIE methods that enable site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation and exchange labeling with gaseous isotopes D2 and T2 are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals. As part of our interest in exploring s&#8208;block metals for catalytic transformations, we found CsN(SiMe3)2 to be an efficient catalyst for selective HIE of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with D2 gas. The reaction proceeds through a kinetic deprotonative equilibrium that establishes an exchange pathway between C&#8722;H bonds and D2 gas. By virtue of multiple C&#8722;H bonds activation and high activity (isotope enrichment up to 99&#8201;%), the simple cesium amide catalyst provided a very powerful and practically convenient labeling protocol for synthesis of highly deuterated compounds and high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ polymerization of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected CNTs and active materials is the key to realize excellent interfacial contact. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Therefore, the integrated batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are promising and safe energy storage devices for mobile electronics and electric vehicles. In this work, we report a facile in situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane electrolytes to fabricate integrated solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The in situ polymerization and formation of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active materials is the key to realizing a high&#8208;performance battery with excellent interfacial contact among CNTs, active materials and electrolytes. Therefore, the electrodes could be tightly integrated into batteries through the CNTs and electrolyte. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Electrodes with a low resistance of 4.5&#8197;&#937;&#8201;&#9633;&#8722;1 and high lithium&#8208;ion diffusion efficiency of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 can significantly improve the electrochemical kinetics. Subsequently, the batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.

         <title>Water&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Colloidal Quantum Wells for Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creatively water&#8208;driven strategy is devised to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue perovskite quantum wells (QWs) with remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The electroluminescent devices based on the QWs show high luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QWs based devices.







Abstract
Perovskite colloidal quantum wells (QWs) are promising to realize narrow deep&#8208;blue emission, but the poor optical performance and stability suppress their practical application. Here, we creatively propose a water&#8208;driven synthesis strategy to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 QWs, corresponding to three monolayers, which emit at the deep&#8208;blue wavelength of 456&#8197;nm. The water controls the orientation and distribution of the ligands on the surface of the nanocrystals, thus inducing orientated growth through the Ostwald ripening process by phagocytizing unstable nanocrystals to form well&#8208;crystallized QWs. These QWs present remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. Furthermore, we have prepared light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the QWs via the all&#8208;solution fabrication strategy, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 1&#8201;% and luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QW&#8208;based LEDs.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuned Multicolor Emission of 2D Lead Halide Perovskites with Ultrahigh Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range and ultrapure emissions are achieved in 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) by combined chemical pressure from halogen doping/substitution and physical pressure from hydrostatic compression. This work demonstrates precise emission tuning and effective color regulation of 2D LHPs by pressure engineering, which would open a new pathway for developing ultrapure emitters and highly sensitive pressure sensors.







Abstract
The chemical diversity and structural flexibility of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) offer tremendous opportunities to tune their optical properties through internal molecular engineering and external stimuli. Herein, we report the wide&#8208;range and ultrapure photoluminescence emissions in a family of homologous 2D LHPs, [MeOPEA]2PbBr4&#8722;4xI4x (MeOPEA=4&#8208;methoxyphenethylammonium; x=0, 0.2, 0.425, 0.575, 1) enabled through internal chemical pressure and external hydrostatic pressure. The chemical pressure, induced by the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and halogen doping/substitution strengthens the structural rigidity to give sustained narrow emissions, and regulates the emission energy, respectively. Further manipulation of physical pressure leads to wide&#8208;range emission tuning from 412 to 647&#8197;nm in a continuous and reversible manner. This work could open up new pathways for developing 2D LHP emitters with ultra&#8208;wide color gamut and high color purity which are highly useful for pressure sensing.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric Bi0.6Sb0.4Te: Elimination of Detrimental Band Inversion in BiTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric materials are the key to miniaturizing refrigeration equipment and have great scientific and social implications, yet their application is hindered by their extreme scarcity. BiTe exhibiting strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling peaks ZT at 600 K. Herein, we discover the synergy effect of Sb doping in BiTe that eliminates the detrimental band inversion and leads to an overlap of conduction band (CB) and valence band that significantly increases the S from 33 to 124 &#956;V/K. In addition, this effect enhances the &#956; from 58 to 92 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#1043;&#8208;A in the first Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Sb doping increases the anharmonicity, shortens the phonon lifetime and lowers &#954;lat. Finally, Se/Sb codoping further optimizes the ZT to 0.6 at 300 K, suggesting that Bi0.6Sb0.4Te1&#8208;ySey is a potential room&#8208;temperature TE material.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous co&#8208;Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Ethanol Oxidation towards Synergistic Acetaldehyde Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 is of great interest but it often suffers sluggish oxidation half reaction and undesired by&#8208;products. Here, we report for the first the simultaneous co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction and ethanol oxidation towards one identical value&#8208;added CH3CHO product on a rubidium and potassium co&#8208;modified carbon nitride (CN&#8208;KRb). The CN&#8208;KRb offers a record photocatalytic activity of 1212.3 &#956;molh&#8208;1g&#8208;1 with a high selectivity of 93.3% for CH3CHO production, outperforming all the state&#8208;of&#8208;art CO2 photocatalysts. It is disclosed that the introduced Rb boosts the *OHCCHO fromation and facilitates the CH3CHO desorption, while K promotes ethanol absorption and activation. Moreover, the H+ stemming from ethanol oxidation is confirmed to participate in the CO2 reduction process, endowing near ideal overall atomic economy. This work provides a new strategy for effective use of the photoexcited electron and hole for high selective and sustainable conversion of CO2 paired with oxidation reaction into identical product.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxylation with Unusual Stereoinversion Catalyzed by an FeII/2&#8208;OG Dependent Oxidase and 3,6&#8208;Diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine Formation in the Biosynthesis of Brevianamide K</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products with the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine core are widely distributed in nature, while the biosynthetic mechanism of 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine in fungi remains to be further elucidated. Through heterologous expression and biochemical investigation of an FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxidase (AspE) and a heme&#8208;dependent P450 enzyme (AspF), we report for the first time that AspE, AspF and subsequent dehydration account for the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure of brevianamide K from Aspergillus sp. SK&#8208;28, a symbiotic fungus of mangrove plant Kandelia candel. More interestingly, in&#8208;depth investigation of enzymatic mechanism demonstrates that AspE achieves an unprecedented stereoinversion hydroxylation of brevianamide Q through hydrogen atom abstraction and water nucleophilical attack from the opposite face of the resultant iminium cation intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Translocation&#8208;Mediated Signal Amplification for Spatially&#8208;Selective Aptasensing of ATP in Inflammatory Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amplified ATP imaging in inflammatory cells is highly desirable. However, the spatial selectivity of current amplification methods is limited, that is, signal amplification is performed systemically and not in a disease site&#8208;specific manner. Here we present a versatile strategy, termed enzymatically triggerable, aptamer&#8208;based signal amplification (ETA&#8208;SA), that enables inflammatory cell&#8208;specific imaging of ATP through spatially&#8208;resolved signal amplification. The ETA&#8208;SA leverages a translocated enzyme in inflammatory cells to activate DNA aptamer probes and further drive cascade reactions through the consumption of hairpin fuels, which, however, exerts no ATP response activity in normal cells, leading to a significantly improved sensitivity and spatial specificity for the inflammation&#8208;specific ATP imaging in vivo. Benefiting from the improved spatial selectivity, enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios were achieved for ATP imaging during acute hepatitis.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;N Coupling through Hydroaminoalkylation on a Single&#8208;Atom Rh Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;N coupling is significant for synthesis of fine chemicals in chemical industries and drug development. Hydroaminoalkylation of olefins is a tandem reaction of C&#8208;N coupling involving first formation of an aldehyde through hydroformylation of an olefin and then production of amine through reductive amination of the aldehyde. Here we report a robust, supported catalyst of singly dispersed Rh1 atoms anchored on P25 nanoparticles designated as Rh1/P25. Its high activity for C&#8208;N coupling was demonstrated by six hydroaminoalkylations of olefins and amines with selectivity of 90&#8208;100% for producing tertiary amines. The singly dispersed Rh1O4 on P25 exhibit activity and selectivity for hydroaminoalkylation higher than reported molecular catalyst, [Rh(cod)2]BF4. In contrast to molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8208;based single&#8208;atom Rh heterogeneous catalysis (Rh1/P25) can be readily separated from reactants and products, reused for multiple runs of hydroaminoalkylation, and recycled with a low cost.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral N,N'&#8208;Bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study establishes the first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N'&#8208;bisindoles via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloadditions of indole&#8208;based enaminones as novel platform molecules with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, where de novo indole&#8208;ring formation is involved. Using this new strategy, various axially chiral N,N'&#8208;bisindoles were synthesized in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 87% yield and 96% ee). More importantly, this class of axially chiral N,N'&#8208;bisindoles exhibited some degree of cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and was derived into axially chiral phosphine ligands with high catalytic activity. This study provides a new strategy for enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N'&#8208;bisindoles using asymmetric organocatalysis and is the first to realize the applications of such scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;triggered Recovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalytic Particles for the Production of High Value Compounds and Enhanced Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;homogeneous polymeric photocatalysts are an emerging class of highly efficient and tunable photocatalytic materials, where the photocatalytic centers are easily accessible. The creation of highly efficient photocatalytic materials that are can be rapidly separated and recovered is one of the critical challenges in photocatalytic chemistry. Here, we describe pH&#8208;responsive photocatalytic nanoparticles that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH, enabling easy recovery. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including Cr(VI) reduction and photoredox alkylation of indole derivative. &#160;Notably, the cationic nature of the photocatalyst accelerates reaction rate of an anionic substrate compared to uncharged species. These photocatalytic particles could be readily recycled allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Copper Single&#8208;Atom Electron Bridge to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and stable photocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a great challenging. Here, we first design a Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst with N&#8211;Cu1&#8211;S single&#8208;atom electron bridge (denoted as Cu&#8208;SAEB) to achieve encouraging CO2RR performance. The production of CO and O2 over Cu&#8208;SAEB is as high as 236.0 and 120.1 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents, respectively, outperforming most of previously reported photocatalysts. Notably, the as&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;SAEB is highly stable throughout 30 cycles reaction of total 300 h, owning to the strengthened contact interface of Cu&#8208;SAEB mediated by N&#8211;Cu1&#8211;S atomic structure. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicated that the SAEB greatly promoted the Z&#8208;scheme interfacial charge transport process, thus leading to great enhancement of photocatalytic CO2RR of Cu&#8208;SAEB. This work represents a promising platform for the development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts that have potential for the practical application of CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

The production of CO and O2 over Cu-SAEB is as high as 236.0 and 120.1 &#956;mol g-1 h-1 in the absence of sacrificial agents, respectively, outperforming most of previously reported photocatalysts. Notably, the as-designed Cu-SAEB is highly stable throughout 30 cycles reaction of total 300 h, owning to the strengthened contact interface of Cu-SAEB mediated by N&#8211;Cu1&#8211;S atomic structure. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicated that the SAEB greatly promoted the Z-scheme interfacial charge transport process, thus leading to great enhancement of photocatalytic CO2RR of Cu-SAEB. This work represents a promising platform for the development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts that have potential for the practical application of CO2 conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Origin of Solvent Deprotonation in LiI&#8208;added Aprotic Electrolyte for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiI and LiBr have been employed as soluble redox mediator (RM) in electrolytes to address the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction kinetics during charging in aprotic Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Compared to LiBr, LiI exhibits a redox potential closer to the theoretical one of discharge products, indicating a higher energy efficacy. However, why the solvent deprotonation occurs in LiI added electrolyte remains unclear. Here, by combining ab initio calculations and experimental validation, we find that it is the nucleophile , that triggers the solvent deprotonation and LiOH formation via nucleophilic attack, rather than the increased solvent acidity (pKa) or C&#8208;H bond elongation as previously suggested. As a comparison, the formation of &#160;in LiBr&#8208;added electrolyte is found to be thermodynamically unfavorable, explaining absence of the solvent deprotonation and Li2O2 as the discharge product. These findings provide important insight into the solvent deprotonation and pave the way for the practical application of LiI RM in aprotic Li&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoisomerizable Zinc(II) Complex Inhibits Microtubule Polymerization for Photoactive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoisomerization&#8208;induced cytotoxicity in photopharmacology provides a unique pathway for phototherapy because it is independent of endogenous oxygen. In this study, we developed a biosafe photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex (Zn1), which releases its trans ligand (trans&#8208;L1) after being irradiated with blue light. This causes the complex to undergo photoisomerization and produce the toxic cis product (cis&#8208;L1) and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). The resulting series of events caused impressive phototoxicity in hypoxic A431 skin cancer cells, as well as in a tumor model in&#8208;vivo. Interestingly, Zn1 was able to inhibit tumor microtubule polymerization, while still showing good biocompatibility and biosafety in&#8208;vivo. This photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex provides a novel strategy for addressing the oxygen&#8208;dependent limitation of traditional photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Binding Microenvironments in Halogen Bonding Polymers for Enhanced Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking nature&#8217;s biopolymeric protein architectures by designing hosts with binding cavities shielded from the bulk solvent environment is a promising approach to achieving anion recognition in competitive protic media. Accomplishing this, however, can be synthetically demanding. Herein we present a more synthetically tractable approach, by directly incorporating potent supramolecular anion recognition motifs into a polymeric scaffold, which can be engineered through a judicious selection of the co&#8208;monomer.&#160;This is demonstrated through a comprehensive analysis of anion recognition and sensing with redox&#8208;active, halogen bonding (XB) polymeric host systems,&#160;in an unprecedented level of detail.&#160;Notably, the polymeric hosts consistently outperform their monomeric analogues, with especially large halide anion binding enhancements of ca. 50&#8208;fold observed in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures. These enhancements are rationalised by a consideration of generated low dielectric constant binding microenvironments from which there is appreciable solvent exclusion. This approach is applicable to a range of hosts and targets, enabling recognition and sensing in highly polar media, otherwise unattainable with the monomeric binding units alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a newly developed SPSiOL&#8208;base bisphosphite ligand (SPSiPO), Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes was realized for the first time, delivering the enantioenriched allylsilanes bearing a tertiary carbon stereocenter in high efficiency and 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economy with highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Here, we report the first example of Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes with high level of regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. The key to achieve this stereoselective hydrosilylation reaction was the development of the SPSiOL&#8208;derived bisphosphite ligands (SPSiPO). This protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent functional group, and heterocycle tolerance, thus provides a versatile method for the construction of enantioenriched tertiary allylsilanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economic manner. DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Based Reactive Oxygen Species Supergenerator for Immunogenic Photochemotherapy against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides new insight and design guidelines for the construction of reactive oxygen species supergenerators by molecular engineering. An integrated perylene therapeutic platform was developed that efficiently realizes immunogenic photochemotherapy against hypoxic tumors.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as cytotoxic radicals to directly kill tumor cells and concurrently trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) to efficiently achieve tumor therapy. Thus motivated, we herein present one perylene monoamide&#8208;based ROS supergenerator (PMIC&#8208;NC) that not only induces hypoxia&#8208;enhanced Type&#8208;I ROS burst aided by proton transients but also triggers Type&#8208;I/II ROS production by electron or energy transfer under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation and also elicits a strong ICD effect. More interesting, the mitochondria&#8208; and lung&#8208;specific distribution of PMIC&#8208;NC also boosts the tumor therapeutic efficiency. As a result, PMIC&#8208;NC was employed for NIR&#8208;triggered photodynamic therapy, hypoxia&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy and also displayed robust immunogenicity for systemic tumor eradication. This work thus contributes one proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of perylene as an integrated therapeutic platform for efficient immunogenic photochemotherapy against hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Highly Reactive Hydrocarbon Soluble Alkylsodium Reagents for Benzylic Aroylation of Toluenes using Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting coordination effects to prepare hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble alkyl organosodium reagents enables the efficient metalation of toluene derivatives under mild and stoichiometric conditions, and their facile conversion into 2&#8208;arylacetophenones. Through the isolation of key organometallic intermediates and their study in solution, new mechanistic insights have been gained into these sodium&#8208;mediated reactions.







Abstract
Deaggregating the alkyl sodium NaCH2SiMe3 with polydentate nitrogen ligands enables the preparation and characterisation of new, hydrocarbon soluble chelated alkylsodium reagents. Equipped with significantly enhanced metalating power over their organolithium counterparts, these systems can promote controlled sodiation of weakly acidic benzylic C&#8722;H bonds from a series of toluene derivatives under mild stoichiometric conditions. This has been demonstrated through the benzylic aroylation of toluenes with Weinreb amides, that delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;arylacetophenones in good to excellent yields. Success in isolating and determining the structures of key organometallic intermediates has provided useful mechanistic insight into these new sodium&#8208;mediated transformations.

         <title>Galvanic Redox Potentiometry for Fouling&#8208;Free and Stable Serotonin Sensing in a Living Animal Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fouling&#8208;free, highly stable, and sensitive sensor based on galvanic redox potentiometry (GRP) is presented to study serotonin dynamics in the living guinea pig brain. The GRP sensor could be used to study many other neurochemicals with similar serious fouling issues in living biosystems, promoting the understanding of brain function and neurological diseases at the molecular level.







Abstract
Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a major neurotransmitter broadly involved in many aspects of feeling and behavior. Although its electro&#8208;activity makes it a promising candidate for electrochemical sensing, the persistent generation of fouling layers on the electrode by its oxidation products presents a hurdle for reliable sensing. Here, we present a fouling&#8208;free 5&#8208;HT sensor based on galvanic redox potentiometry. The sensor efficiently minimizes electrode fouling as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, ensuring a less than 3&#8201;% signal change in a 2&#8197;hour continuous experiment, whereas amperometric sensors losing 90&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min. Most importantly, the sensor is highly amenable for in vivo studies, permitting real&#8208;time 5&#8208;HT monitoring, and supporting the mechanism associated with serotonin release in brain. Our system offers an effective way for sensing different neurochemicals having significant fouling issues, thus facilitating the molecular&#8208;level understanding of brain function.

         <title>In Situ Reprogramming of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages with Internally and Externally Engineered Exosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of internally and externally engineered exosomes (I3E) was constructed with the CRISPR interference system internally engineered, and the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs)&#8208;specific peptide externally engineered. I3E enabled to in situ reprogram the M2 TAMs to M1 by inactivating PI3K&#947; completely, which awakened the &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor&#8208;immunity and inhibited tumor growth significantly.







Abstract
The reprogramming of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as an efficient strategy for immunotherapy. However, most of the approaches did not allow the in situ reprogramming of TAM because their low efficiency, non&#8208;specificity, or potential side effects. Herein, we produced exosomes with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) internally engineered and the TAM specific peptide externally engineered onto the exosome membrane. The internally and externally engineered exosomes (IEEE, also named as I3E) allowed the selective homing to tumor tissue and targeted to M2&#8208;like TAMs, which nearly repressed the expression of PI&#8208;3 kinase gamma (PI3K&#947;) completely, and induced the TAMs polarizing to M1 both in vitro and in vivo. The polarized M1 macrophages awakened the &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor&#8208;immunity, causing the increase of T lymphocyte infiltration and the decrease of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and inhibiting the tumor growth significantly. I3E reprogramed TAMs in situ precisely and efficiently.

         <title>Glycine Imine&#8212;The Elusive &#945;&#8208;Imino Acid Intermediate in the Reductive Amination of Glyoxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Iminoacetic acid or glycine imine is a proposed key intermediate in the reductive amination of glyoxylic acid. In contrast to well&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amino acids the compound class of &#945;&#8208;imino acids is not much explored and not well&#8208;characterized. Glycine imine was prepared through photochemical denitrogenation of 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid, spectroscopically characterized, and its reactivity studied in aqueous solution.







Abstract
Simple unhindered aldimines tend to hydrolyze or oligomerize and are therefore spectroscopically not well characterized. Herein we report the formation and spectroscopic characterization of the simplest imino acid, namely glycine imine, by cryogenic matrix isolation IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Glycine imine forms after UV irradiation of 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid by N2 extrusion in anti&#8208;(E,E)&#8208; and anti&#8208;(Z,Z)&#8208;conformation that can be photochemically interconverted. In matrix isolation pyrolysis experiments with 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid, glycine imine cannot be trapped as it further decarboxylates to aminomethylene. In aqueous solution glycine imine is hydrolyzed to hydroxy glycine and hydrated glyoxylic acid. At higher concentrations or in the presence of FeIISO4 as a reducing agent glycine imine undergoes self&#8208;reduction by oxidative decarboxylation chemistry. Glycine imine may be seen as one of the key reaction intermediates connecting prebiotic amino acid and sugar formation chemistry.

         <title>A New Bacterial Adenosine&#8208;Derived Nucleoside as an Example of RNA Modification Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem mass spectrometry combined with stable isotope labelling identified a new nucleoside species, namely 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenosine (ms2&#1013;A), in bacterial transfer RNA (tRNA). Rare occurrence on tRNA, especially when involved in translation, and the structural as well as metabolic relation to the known tRNA modification 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (ms2i6A) argue for ms2&#1013;A to be an oxidatively damaged form of ms2i6A.







Abstract
The fields of RNA modification and RNA damage both exhibit a plethora of non&#8208;canonical nucleoside structures. While RNA modifications have evolved to improve RNA function, the term RNA damage implies detrimental effects. Based on stable isotope labelling and mass spectrometry, we report the identification and characterisation of 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenosine (ms2&#1013;A), which is related to 1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenine, a lesion resulting from exposure of nucleic acids to alkylating chemicals in vivo. In contrast, a sophisticated isoprene labelling scheme revealed that ms2&#1013;A biogenesis involves cleavage of a prenyl moiety in the known transfer RNA (tRNA) modification 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (ms2i6A). The relative abundance of ms2&#1013;A in tRNAs from translating ribosomes suggests reduced function in comparison to its parent RNA modification, establishing the nature of the new structure in a newly perceived overlap of the two previously separate fields, namely an RNA modification damage.

         <title>Integrated Micro Space Electrostatic Field in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery: Scalable Electrospray Fabrication of Porous Crystalline Anode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospray has been applied for scalable fabrication (&gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;cm2 in a batch&#8208;experiment) of hetero&#8208;metallic cluster covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (MCOF&#8208;Ti6Cu3) nanosheet&#8208;coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection.







Abstract
The inhomogeneous consumption of anions and direct contact between electrolyte and anode during the Zn&#8208;deposition process generate Zn&#8208;dendrites and side reactions that can aggravate the space&#8208;charge effect to hinder the practical implementation of zinc&#8208;metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, electrospray has been applied for the scalable fabrication (&gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;cm2 in a batch&#8208;experiment) of hetero&#8208;metallic cluster covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (MCOF&#8208;Ti6Cu3) nanosheet&#8208;coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection. The MNC@Zn symmetric cell presents ultralow overpotential (&#8776;72.8&#8197;mV) over 10&#8201;000 cycles at 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is superior to bare Zn and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art porous crystalline materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that MNC with integrated micro space electrostatic field can facilitate the deposition&#8208;kinetic and homogenize the electric field of anode to significantly promote the lifespan of ZMBs.

&lt;p&gt;Electrospray has been applied for scalable fabrication (&amp;gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a batch-experiment) of hetero-metallic cluster covalent-organic-frameworks (MCOF-Ti&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanosheet-coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inhomogeneous consumption of anions and direct contact between electrolyte and anode during the Zn-deposition process generate Zn-dendrites and side reactions that can aggravate the space-charge effect to hinder the practical implementation of zinc-metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, electrospray has been applied for the scalable fabrication (&amp;gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a batch-experiment) of hetero-metallic cluster covalent-organic-frameworks (MCOF-Ti&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanosheet-coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection. The MNC@Zn symmetric cell presents ultralow overpotential (&#8776;72.8&#8197;mV) over 10&#8201;000 cycles at 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is superior to bare Zn and state-of-the-art porous crystalline materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that MNC with integrated micro space electrostatic field can facilitate the deposition-kinetic and homogenize the electric field of anode to significantly promote the lifespan of ZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Fusion Yields Guest Acceptors that Enable Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 18.77&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the novel asymmetric guest acceptor was rationally designed by combining the structural fusion and unidirectional extension strategies. The optimized ternary device with the incorporation of this guest acceptor achieved considerably improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.77&#8201;% with a boosted open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.896&#8197;V.







Abstract
The design and selection of a suitable guest acceptor are particularly important for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we designed and successfully synthesized two asymmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen bridged guest acceptors, which featured distinct blue&#8208;shifted absorption, upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, and larger dipole moments than symmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen&#8208;bridged acceptor. Ternary devices with the incorporation of 14.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% these two asymmetric guest acceptors exhibited excellent performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.22&#8201;% and 18.77&#8201;%, respectively. Our success in precise control of material properties via structural fusion of five&#8208;membered carbon linkages and six&#8208;membered silicon&#8211;oxygen connection at the central electron&#8208;donating core unit of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors can attract considerable attention and bring new vigor and vitality for developing new materials toward more efficient OSCs.

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Construction in Water Towards Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on strong metal&#8208;support interaction construction were produced leveraging the instantaneous energy input from ultrasonication under near&#8208;ambient conditions in H2O. Encapsulation of the metal nanoparticles was achieved via the formation of reducible metal oxide overlayers, leading to enhanced performance and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions and CO2 conversion.







Abstract
The development of facile methodologies to afford robust supported metal nanocatalysts under mild conditions is highly desirable yet challenging, particularly via strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) construction. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches capable of generating SMSI encapsulation mainly focus on high temperature annealing in reductive/oxidative atmosphere. Herein, ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on SMSI construction were produced by leveraging the instantaneous high&#8208;energy input from ultrasonication under ambient conditions in H2O, which could rapidly afford abundant active intermediates, Ti3+ ions, and oxygen vacancies within the scaffolds to induce the SMSI overlayer formation. The encapsulation degree could be tuned and controlled via the reducibility of the solvents and the ultrasonication parameters. This facile and efficient approach could be further extended to diverse metal oxide supports and noble metal NPs leading to enhanced performance in hydrogenation reactions and CO2 conversion.

         <title>Biomolecular Click Reactions Using a Minimal pH&#8208;Activated Catcher/Tag Pair for Producing Native&#8208;Sized Spider&#8208;Silk Proteins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Catcher/Tag pair to be used for isopeptide&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated biological click reactions is reported. The newly designed pair, named SilkCatcher/Tag pair, shows activity both in vivo and in vitro and is pH&#8208;activated. Native&#8208;sized spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like protein in very high purity is produced by combining the SilkCatcher/Tag pair with the widely used SpyCatcher/Tag pair.







Abstract
A type of protein/peptide pair known as Catcher/Tag pair spontaneously forms an intermolecular isopeptide bond which can be applied for biomolecular click reactions. Covalent protein conjugation using Catcher/Tag pairs has turned out to be a valuable tool in biotechnology and biomedicines, but it is essential to increase the current toolbox of orthogonal Catcher/Tag pairs to expand the range of applications further, for example, for controlled multiple&#8208;fragment ligation. We report here the engineering of novel Catcher/Tag pairs for protein ligation, aided by a crystal structure of a minimal CnaB domain from Lactobacillus plantarum. We show that a newly engineered pair, called SilkCatcher/Tag enables efficient pH&#8208;inducible protein ligation in addition to being compatible with the widely used SpyCatcher/Tag pair. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the SilkCatcher/Tag pair in the production of native&#8208;sized highly repetitive spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like proteins with &gt;90&#8201;% purity, which is not possible by traditional recombinant production methods.

         <title>The COVID19&#8208;NMR Consortium: A Public Report on the Impact of this New Global Collaboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article discusses how the global NMR community organized itself to rapidly contribute to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This new collaborative research might serve as model for future ways to address great societal needs, without competing with curiosity&#8208;driven research.







Abstract
The outbreak of COVID&#8208;19 in December 2019 required the formation of international consortia for a coordinated scientific effort to understand and combat the virus. In this Viewpoint Article, we discuss how the NMR community has gathered to investigate the genome and proteome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and tested them for binding to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight binders. External factors including extended lockdowns due to the global pandemic character of the viral infection triggered the transition from locally focused collaborative research conducted within individual research groups to digital exchange formats for immediate discussion of unpublished results and data analysis, sample sharing, and coordinated research between more than 50 groups from 18 countries simultaneously. We discuss key lessons that might pertain after the end of the pandemic and challenges that we need to address.

         <title>Synthesis of a Dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbon and the Impact of Non&#8208;Alternant Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon (PCH1) containing four contiguous heptagons was synthesized by Juan Casado, Junzhi Liu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217124). The four contiguous heptagons form a Z shape in the central &#960;&#8208;electron skeleton, giving PCH1 a butterfly&#8208;shaped conformation.

         <title>Designing Heteroatom&#8208;Codoped Iron Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Promotional Photoreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational engineering active sites and vantage defects of catalysts are promising but grand challenging task to enhance photoreduction CO2 to high value&#8208;added C2 products. In this study, we designed an N,S&#8208;codoped Fe&#8208;based MIL&#8208;88B catalyst with well&#8208;defined bipyramidal hexagonal prism morphology via a facile and effective process, which was synthesized by addition of appropriate 1,2&#8208;benzisothiazolin&#8208;3&#8208;one (BIT) and acetic acid to the reaction solution. Under simulated solar irradiation, the designed catalyst exhibits high C2H4 evolution yield of 17.7 &#956;mol/g&#183;h, which has been rarely achieved in photocatalytic CO2 reduction process. The synergistic effect of Fe&#8722;N coordinated sites and reasonable defects in the N,S&#8208;codoped photocatalyst can accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers, resulting in high electron density, and this in turn helps to facilitate the formation and dimerization of C&#8211;C coupling intermediates for C2H4 effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>The Directional Crystallization Process of Poly (triazine imide) Single Crystals in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (triazine imide) photocatalysts prepared via molten salt methods emerge as promising polymer semiconductors with one&#8208;step excitation capacity of overall water splitting. Unveiling the molecular conjugation, nucleation, and crystallization processes of PTI crystals is crucial for their controllable structure design. Herein, microscopy characterization was conducted at the PTI crystallization front from meso to nano scales. Heptazine&#8208;based precursor was found to depolymerize to triazine monomers within molten salts and KCl cubes precipitate as the leading cores that guide the directional stacking of PTI molecular units to form aggregated crystals. Upon this discovery, PTI crystals with improved dispersibility and enhanced photocatalytic performance were obtained by tailoring the crystallization fronts. This study advances insights into the directional assembling of PTI monomers on salt templates, placing a theoretical foundation for the ordered condensation of polymer crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pair of Interconverting Cages Formed from Achiral Precursors Spontaneously Resolve into Homochiral Conformers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without chiral induction the emergence of homochirality from achiral molecules is rather serendipitous, as the rationale is somewhat ambiguous. We herein provide a plausible solution. From achiral precursors are formed a pair of interconverting cage conformers that exhibit a&#160;C3&#8208;axis&#160;as the only symmetry element. When their interconversion is impeded with intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, each&#160;conformer&#160;self&#8208;sorts into a homochiral crystal, which is driven by&#160;a helical network of multivalent intermolecular interactions during the self&#8208;assembly of homochiral cage conformers.&#160;As no chiral induction is involved throughout, we believe our study could enlighten the rational design for the emergence of homochirality with several criteria: 1) formation of a molecule without&#160;inversion center or mirror plane; 2) suppression of the enantiomeric interconversion, and introduction of&#160;multivalent interactions&#160;along the helical trajectory of screw symmetry&#160;within the resulting superstructure.</dc:description>

         <title>Managing Secondary Phase Lead Iodide in Hybrid Perovskites via Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Robust Environmental Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rationally managing the secondary&#8208;phase excess lead iodide (PbI2) in hybrid perovskite is of significance for pursuing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the challenge remains on its conversion to a homogeneous layer that is robust stable against environmental stimuli. We herein demonstrate an effective strategy of surface reconstruction that converts the excess PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer, which substantially stabilizes the perovskite film and reduces interfacial charge transfer barrier in the PSCs device. The perovskite films with such bi&#8208;layer could bear harsh conditions such as soaking in water, light illumination at 70% relative humidity, and the damp&#8208;thermal (85 &#176;C and 30% humidity) environment. The resulted PSCs deliver a champion efficiency up to 24.09%, as well as remarkable environmental stability, e.g., retaining 78% of their initial efficiency after 5500 h of shelf storage, and 82% after 1000 h of operational stability testing.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopy vs. Electrochemistry: Catalyst Layer Thickness Effects on Operando / In Situ Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, operando / in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has become an important tool in the electrocatalysis community. However, the high catalyst loadings often required to acquire XA&#8208;spectra with a satisfactory signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio frequently imply the use of thick catalyst layers (CLs) with large ion&#8208; and mass&#8208;transport limitations. To shed light on the impact of this variable on the spectro&#8208;electrochemical results, in this study we investigate Pd&#8208;hydride formation in carbon&#8208;supported Pd&#8208;nanoparticles (Pd/C) and an unsupported Pd&#8208;aerogel with similar Pd surface areas but drastically different morphologies and electrode packing densities. Our in situ XAS and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements with different loadings unveil that the CL&#8208;thickness largely determines the hydride formation trends inferred from spectro&#8208;electrochemical experiments, therewith calling for the minimization of the CL&#8208;thickness in such experiments and the use of complementary thin&#8208;film control measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlative Cellular Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Amperometry Show Dose Dependent Changes in Lipid Composition and Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aberrant functioning of the proteasome has been associated with crucial pathologic conditions including neurodegeneration. Yet, the complex underlying causes at the cellular level remain unclear and there are conflicting reports of neuroprotective to neurodegenerative effects of proteasomal inhibitors such as lactacystin that are utilised as models for neurodegenerative diseases. The conflicting results may be associated with different dose regimes of lactacystin and hence we have performed a dose dependent study of the effects of lactacystin to identify concurrent changes in the cell membrane lipid profile and the dynamics of exocytosis using a combination of surface sensitive mass spectrometry and single cell amperometry. Significant changes of negatively charged lipids were associated with different lactacystin doses that showed a weak correlation with exocytosis while changes in PE and PE&#8208;O lipids showed dose dependent changes correlated with initial pore formation and total release of vesicle content respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustration in Super&#8208;Ionic Conductors Unraveled by the Density of Atomistic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The frustration in super&#8208;ionic conductors enables their exceptionally high ionic conductivities, which are desired for many technological applications including batteries and fuel cells. A key challenge in the study of frustration is the difficulties to analyze a large number of disordered atomistic configurations. Using lithium superionic conductors as model systems, we propose and demonstrate the density of atomistic states (DOAS) analytics to quantitatively characterize the onset and degree of disordering, reveal the energetics of local disorder, and elucidate how the frustration enhances diffusion, through the broadening and overlapping of the energy levels of atomistic states. Furthermore, material design strategies aided by the DOAS are devised and demonstrated for new super&#8208;ionic conductors. The DOAS is generally applicable analytics for unraveling fundamental mechanisms in complex atomistic systems and for guiding material design.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Engineering for High&#8208;Yielding Amide Formation: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Glycine in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide syntheses remain a key challenging green chemistry reaction. For instance, green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycine as biosurfactants and therapeutics are highly desirable to replace chemical pathway using toxic phosgene. Here, we report a novel concept for enzymatic amidation in an aqueous system via glycerol&#8208;activation of fatty acid and its subsequent aminolysis with glycine to synthesize N&#8208;acyl glycine. We then engineer an enzyme (proRML) by reshaping its catalytic pocket to enhance its aminolysis activity and catalytic efficiency by 103&#8208;fold and 465&#8208;fold, respectively. The evolved proRML (D156S/L258K/L267N/S83D/L58K/R86K/W88V) catalyzed the amidation of fatty acid by glycine to N&#8208;lauroylglycine with high yield (80%). It accepts a broad range of medium to long&#8208;chain fatty acids (C8&#8208;C18), giving high yields of N&#8208;decanoyl, N&#8208;myristoyl, and N&#8208;oleoylglycine. The developed amidation concept may be general, and the engineered enzyme is useful for green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycine.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Energy Transfer in A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Facilitates Excited&#8208;State Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes excited&#8208;state nickel&#8208;catalyzed borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions in a covalent organic framework (COF). Rapid energy transfer in the sp2&#8208;carbon conjugated COF facilitates the generation of aryl radicals from nickel&#8208;aryl complexes, leading to two orders of magnitude higher catalytic efficiency than the homogeneous counterpart in aryl borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received broad interest owing to their permanent porosity, high stability, and tunable functionalities. COFs with long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;conjugation and photosensitizing building blocks have been explored for sustainable photocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of COF&#8208;based energy transfer Ni catalysis. A pyrene&#8208;based COF with sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugation was synthesized and used to coordinate NiII centers through bipyridine moieties. Under light irradiation, enhanced energy transfer in the COF facilitated the excitation of Ni centers to catalyze borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions of aryl halides. The COF showed two orders of magnitude higher efficiency in these reactions than its homogeneous control and could be recovered and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>An Aluminum Telluride with a Terminal Al=Te Bond and its Conversion to an Aluminum Tellurocarbonate by CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile isolation of various dimeric aluminum selenides and tellurides, as well as an aluminum&#8208;telluride monomer featuring a terminal Al=Te bond, is reported. The aluminum&#8208;telluride monomer exhibits high thermal stability and reacts with three equivalents of CO2 to form an unprecedented tellurocarbonate [CO2Te]2&#8722; substituted aluminum complex, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of the carbonate [CO3]2&#8722;.







Abstract
Facile access to dimeric heavier aluminum chalcogenides [(NHC)Al(Tipp)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;Ch]2 (NHC=IiPr (1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene); Tipp=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2; Ch=Se, Te) by treatment of NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminum dihydrides with elemental Se and Te is reported. The higher affinity of IMe4 in comparison with IiPr toward the Al center in [(NHC)Al(Tipp)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;Ch]2 can be used for ligand exchange. Additionally, the presence of excess IMe4 allows for cleavage of the dimers to form a rare example of a neutral multiply bonded heavier aluminum chalcogenide in the form of a tetracoordinate aluminum complex, (IMe4)2(Tipp)Al=Te. This species reacts with three equivalents of CO2 across two Al&#8722;CNHC and the Al=Te bond affording a pentacoordinate aluminum complex containing a dianionic tellurocarbonate ligand [CO2Te]2&#8722;, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of a carbonate [CO3]2&#8722;.

         <title>Confining the Sol&#8208;Gel Reaction at the Water/Oil Interface: Creating Compartmentalized Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Organelles for Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic the compartmentalization of enzyme reactions in living organisms, in this study we developed an efficient and safe method for in situ encapsulating enzymes in aqueous&#8208;core mesoporous nanocapsules. The enzyme&#8208;carrying nanocapsules, as synthetic nano&#8208;organelles, were able to successfully perform cascade reactions when enveloped in a polymer vesicle, mimicking the hierarchically compartmentalized reactions in the eukaryotic cells.







Abstract
Living organisms compartmentalize their catalytic reactions in membranes for increased efficiency and selectivity. To mimic the organelles of eukaryotic cells, we develop a mild approach for in situ encapsulating enzymes in aqueous&#8208;core silica nanocapsules. In order to confine the sol&#8208;gel reaction at the water/oil interface of miniemulsion, we introduce an aminosilane to the silica precursors, which serves as both catalyst and an amphiphilic anchor that electrostatically assembles with negatively charged hydrolyzed alkoxysilanes at the interface. The semi&#8208;permeable shell protects enzymes from proteolytic attack, and allows the transport of reactants and products. The enzyme&#8208;carrying nanocapsules, as synthetic nano&#8208;organelles, are able to perform cascade reactions when enveloped in a polymer vesicle, mimicking the hierarchically compartmentalized reactions in eukaryotic cells. This in situ encapsulation approach provides a versatile platform for the delivery of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Selective 3,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Azobenzenes upon Complexation by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;C bond formation and complete N=N bond rupture in azobenzenes was induced by a heterosiloxane&#8208;type frustrated POSi Lewis pair; the reactivity resembles that of the acid initiated classical benzidine rearrangement, but starting from an N=N double&#8208;bonded system.







Abstract
The reaction of the oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (1) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (2) with azobenzene, promoted by UV irradiation, led to a selective complexation of the cis&#8208;isomer. The addition product of 2 is stable, while the adduct of 1 isomerizes in solution in an ortho&#8208;benzidine&#8208;like [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond, saturation of the nitrogen atoms with hydrogen atoms and formation of a new bond between two phenyl ortho&#8208;carbon atoms. Similar rearrangements take place with different para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes (R=Me, OMe, Cl) and di(2&#8208;naphthyl)diazene, while ortho&#8208;methylated azo compounds do not form adducts with 1. All adducts were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses and the mechanism of the rearrangement was explored by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Engineering Cytochrome P450BM3 Enzymes for Direct Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxidase activity of a dual&#8208;functional small&#8208;molecule (DFSM)&#8208;facilitated P450BM3&#8208;H2O2 system was drastically improved through mechanism&#8208;guided protein engineering for the P450&#8208;mediated direct nitration of phenols, anilines, and styrenes using nitrite as the nitrating agent. Co&#8208;crystal structures revealed the crucial role of the steric effect introduced by site&#8208;directed mutations of proximal residues in the regulation of substrate access.







Abstract
Applications of the peroxidase activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes in synthetic chemistry remain largely unexplored. We present herein a protein engineering strategy to increase cytochrome P450BM3 peroxidase activity for the direct nitration of aromatic compounds and terminal aryl&#8208;substituted olefins in the presence of a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Site&#8208;directed mutations of key active&#8208;site residues allowed the efficient regulation of steric effects to limit substrate access and, thus, a significant decrease in monooxygenation activity and increase in peroxidase activity. Nitration of several phenol and aniline compounds also yielded ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;nitration products with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high total turnover numbers. Besides direct aromatic nitration by P450 variants using nitrite as a nitrating agent, we also demonstrated the use of the DFSM&#8208;facilitated P450 peroxidase system for the nitration of the vinyl group of styrene and its derivatives.

         <title>Simultaneous Stabilization of Lithium Anode and Cathode using Hyperconjugative Electrolytes for High&#8208;voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecule descriptors proposed in this work guide a bottom&#8208;up hyperconjugative electrolyte design, which exhibits superior stability for both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode, enables the 4.6&#8197;V Li||LCO full cell (30&#8197;&#956;m Li, 4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 LCO, low N/P ratio of 1.3) a great performance improvement. The bottom&#8208;up electrolyte design concept opens up a universal strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Although great progress has been made in new electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), the intrinsic relationship between electrolyte composition and cell performance remains unclear due to the lack of valid quantization method. Here, we proposed the concept of negative center of electrostatic potential (NCESP) and Mayer bond order (MBO) to describe solvent capability, which highly relate to solvation structure and oxidation potential, respectively. Based on established principles, the selected electrolyte with 1.7&#8197;M LiFSI in methoxytrimethylsilane (MOTMS)/ (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFMTMS) shows unique hyperconjugation nature to stabilize both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode. The 4.6&#8197;V 30&#8197;&#956;m Li||4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (low N/P ratio of 1.3) cell with our electrolyte shows stable cycling with 91&#8201;% capacity retention over 200&#8197;cycles. The bottom&#8208;up design concept of electrolyte opens up a general strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Green&#8208;solvent Processable Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Star&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor structure with 3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile pyridine core has been developed as an efficient design strategy towards high performance green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). The resulting BTP1 HTM processed by green solvent of 2&#8208;methylanisole, a kind of food additive, shows an impressive efficiency of 24.34&#8201;% based on inverted perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
The commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) urgently requires the development of green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). However, strong intermolecular interactions that ensure high hole mobility always compromise the solubility and film&#8208;forming ability in green solvents. Herein, we show a simple but effective design strategy to solve this trade&#8208;off, that is, constructing star&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A&#8208;D structure. The resulting HTMs (BTP1&#8208;2) can be processed by green solvent of 2&#8208;methylanisole (2MA), a kind of food additive, and show high hole mobility and multiple defect passivation effects. An impressive efficiency of 24.34&#8201;% has been achieved for 2MA&#8208;processed BTP1 based inverted PVSCs, the highest value for green&#8208;solvent processable HTMs so far. Moreover, it is manifested that the charge separation of D&#8208;A type HTMs at the photoinduced excited state can help to passivate the defects of perovskites, indicating a new HTM design insight.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer and Spin&#8208;Flip States: Thriving as Complements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer excited states have been at the focus of inorganic photochemistry for decades, together with their strongest opponents: detrimental metal&#8208;centered states. In recent years, interest in metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip states was reignited by a new type of photoactive chromium(III) complex. This Review delineates similarities and unique features of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states, from fundamentals to applications.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes with photoactive charge&#8208;transfer excited states are pervasive throughout the literature. In particular, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), with its metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer emission, has been established as a key complex. Meanwhile, interest in so&#8208;called spin&#8208;flip metal&#8208;centered states has risen dramatically after the molecular ruby [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) led to design principles to access strong, long&#8208;lived emission from photostable chromium(III) complexes. This Review contrasts the properties of emissive charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states by using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ as prototypical examples. We discuss the relevant excited states, the tunability of their energy and lifetimes, and their response to external stimuli. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states in applications such as photocatalysis and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Splitting and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction provide a promising way to alleviate energy crisis and environmental issues. This review summarizes recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). In addition, the fundamentals of the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs and several advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the photocatalytic process and mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provide promising solutions to global energy and environmental issues. In recent years, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous solids featuring well&#8208;defined and tailorable structures as well as high surface areas, have captured great interest toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. In this review, the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs is first discussed. We then summarize the recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over MOF&#8208;based materials and focus on the unique advantage of MOFs for clarifying the structure&#8208;property relationship in photocatalysis. In addition, some representative characterization techniques have been presented to unveil the photocatalytic kinetics and reaction intermediates in MOF&#8208;based systems. Finally, the challenges, and perspectives for future directions are proposed.

In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous solids featuring well-defined and tailorable structures as well as high surface areas, have captured great interest toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. In this review, the semiconductor-like behavior of MOFs is first discussed. We then summarize the recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction over MOF-based materials and focus on the unique advantage of MOFs for clarifying the structure-property relationship in photocatalysis. In addition, some representative characterization techniques have been presented to unveil the photocatalytic kinetics and reaction intermediates in MOF-based systems. Finally, the challenges, and perspectives for future directions are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Annulated Azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulenes: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives and their 4,5&#8208;dihydro analogues have been prepared in four synthetic steps or less from commercially available compounds. These molecules exhibit high molar absorption coefficients in the visible region and good charge transport properties in field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid hydrocarbons exhibit very different optical and electronic properties than their well&#8208;studied benzenoid analogues. However, preparing such structures with extended conjugation length, remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives using a two&#8208;step sequence involving a four&#8208;fold aldol condensation between aromatic dialdehydes and readily available tetrahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;(1H,3H)&#8208;dione. Molecules with band gap values ranging from 1.69 to 2.14&#8197;eV and molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;) of nearly 3&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 have been prepared. These annulene&#8208;like structures exhibit significant diatropic ring currents (aromatic), as supported by 1H NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) using azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives as semiconductors exhibit charge mobility values of up to 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>A Switchable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Dye Based on Redox&#8208;Bistable Benzitetraazaporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable, redox&#8208;switchable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins are reported. Whereas the 18&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic form does not show near&#8208;IR absorption, the antiaromatic 20&#960;&#8208;electron form unexpectedly shows intense near&#8208;IR absorption owing to an electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition resulting from symmetry&#8208;lowering of the porphyrin skeleton. The redox process is reversible and switching can be repeated multiple times.







Abstract
Activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes responsive to external stimuli are used in medical and other applications. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of bench&#8208;stable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins (BzTAPs) possessing redox&#8208;switchable NIR properties. X&#8208;Ray, NMR, and UV/Visible&#8208;NIR analyses revealed that 20&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 1 exhibits NIR absorption and antiaromaticity with a paratropic ring&#8208;current, while 18&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 2 shows weakly aromatic character with NIR inertness. Notably, the NIR&#8208;silent BzTAP 2 was readily converted to the NIR&#8208;active BzTAP 1 in the presence of mild reducing agents such as amine. The intense NIR absorption band of BzTAP 1 is in sharp contrast to the very weak absorption bands of previously reported antiaromatic porphyrinoids. Molecular orbital analysis revealed that symmetry&#8208;lowering perturbation of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron porphyrinoid skeleton enables the HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition of 1 to be electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed. BzTAPs are expected to be useful for constructing activatable NIR probes working in reductive environments.

         <title>Complementary Design in Multicomponent Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction: Beyond the Leverage in Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complementary design in multicomponent electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction. By integrating distinct yet complementary electronic structures of elements in different blocks, this concept is revolutionary in that it breaks the limitations of scaling relations, synchronously achieving high activity and selectivity for electrochemical nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is promising in place of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for artificial N2 fixation. However, the high activity and selectivity of eNRR are challenging to achieve simultaneously due to the scaling relations. Such &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity has severely restricted eNRR. To overcome this bottleneck, the complementary design of electronic structures in multicomponent electrocatalysts has been recently pursued, aiming to maximize the advantages of each component and optimize the multistep reactions, which has stood at the cutting edge in this aspect. Here, we present a minireview of the design, performance, and mechanism of multicomponent electrocatalysts with complementary electronic structures. We particularly emphasize the interactions between N2 and elements from d&#8208;, p&#8208;, and s&#8208;blocks, which are essential for understanding how these electrocatalysts are beyond the &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the advancements in the field of macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline charge&#8208;transfer assemblies, including their preparation, structures, and diverse supramolecular functions and applications, such as vapochromic behavior and supramolecular tessellations, arising from the CT state. Future perspectives and challenges of this emerging research field are also presented.







Abstract
Synthetic macrocycles have served as principal tools for supramolecular chemistry, have greatly extended the scope of organic charge transfer (CT) complexes, and have proved to be of great practical value in the solid state during the past few years. In this Minireview, we summarize the research progress on the macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline supramolecular assemblies primarily driven by intermolecular CT interactions (a.k.a. macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline CT assemblies, MCCAs for short), which are classified by their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) constituent elements, including simplex macrocyclic hosts, heterogeneous macrocyclic hosts, and host&#8211;guest D&#8208;A pairs. Particular attention will be focused on their diverse functions and applications, as well as the underlying CT mechanisms from the perspective of crystal engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are outlined.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of PD&#8208;L1 and Activation of the STING Pathway by Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based PROTACs for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed to recognize and bind programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) distributed in tumor cells and recruit the cereblon (CRBN) for PD&#8208;L1 degradation. These nanosized PROTACs can efficiently accumulate at the tumor site and activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to augmented cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is an emerging approach to degrade disease&#8208;associated proteins. Here, we report carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based PROTACs (CDTACs) that degrade membrane proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. CDTACs can bind to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), recruit cereblon (CRBN) to induce PD&#8208;L1 ubiquitination, and degrade them with proteasomes. Fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) is also used to enhance the cellular uptake and proteasome activity. More than 99&#8201;% or 90&#8201;% of PD&#8208;L1 in CT26 or B16&#8208;F10 tumor cells can be degraded by CDTACs, respectively. Furthermore, CDTACs can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to trigger immune responses. Thus, CDTACs with FMD treatment effectively inhibit the growth of CT26 and B16&#8208;F10 tumors. Compared with small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based PROTACs, CDTACs offer several advantages, such as efficient membrane protein degradation, targeted tumor accumulation, immune system activation, and in vivo detection.

     alt="Targeted Degradation of PD-L1 and Activation of the STING Pathway by Carbon-Dot-Based PROTACs for Cancer Immunotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon-dot (CD)-based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed to recognize and bind programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) distributed in tumor cells and recruit the cereblon (CRBN) for PD-L1 degradation. These nanosized PROTACs can efficiently accumulate at the tumor site and activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to augmented cancer immunotherapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is an emerging approach to degrade disease-associated proteins. Here, we report carbon-dot (CD)-based PROTACs (CDTACs) that degrade membrane proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. CDTACs can bind to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), recruit cereblon (CRBN) to induce PD-L1 ubiquitination, and degrade them with proteasomes. Fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) is also used to enhance the cellular uptake and proteasome activity. More than 99&#8201;% or 90&#8201;% of PD-L1 in CT26 or B16-F10 tumor cells can be degraded by CDTACs, respectively. Furthermore, CDTACs can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to trigger immune responses. Thus, CDTACs with FMD treatment effectively inhibit the growth of CT26 and B16-F10 tumors. Compared with small-molecule-based PROTACs, CDTACs offer several advantages, such as efficient membrane protein degradation, targeted tumor accumulation, immune system activation, and in vivo detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Triptycene&#8208;Based 2D MOF with Vertically Extended Structure for Improving the Electrocatalytic Performance of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional vertically conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu)) was designed and synthesized with a hexahydroxyltriptycene ligand, which features a vertically extended structure. The 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency improvement than the planarly extended 2D conductive MOFs, displaying the potential of the structural design in the catalytic performance enhancement.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their unique structures and physical&#8208;chemical properties. However, the planarly extended structure of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs usually limited the accessibility of the active sites. Herein, we designed a triptycene&#8208;based 2D vertically conductive MOF (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF) by coordinating 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexahydroxyltriptycene (HHTC) with Cu2+. The vertically extended 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) possesses a weak interlayer interaction, which leads to a facile exfoliation to the nanosheet. Compared with the classical 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs with planarly extended 2D structures, 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a 100&#8201;% increased catalytic activity in terms of turnover number and a two&#8208;fold increased selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that higher activity originated from the lower energy barriers of the vertically extended 2D structures during the CO2 reduction reaction process.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Encapsulating C60 Fullerene into Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated C60 molecules are encapsulated in a Zr&#8208;based NU&#8208;901 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to obtain a C60@NU&#8208;901 composite. Host&#8208;guest interactions amplify the irregular charge distribution of the system, giving rise to an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field that promotes efficient charge separation and transportation of carriers. The composite mediates photocatalytic H2 production under visible light.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often limited by poor charge separation and slow charge&#8208;transfer kinetics. Herein, a novel MOF photocatalyst is successfully constructed by encapsulating C60 into a nano&#8208;sized zirconium&#8208;based MOF, NU&#8208;901. By virtue of host&#8208;guest interactions and uneven charge distribution, a substantial electrostatic potential difference is set&#8208;up in C60@NU&#8208;901. The direct consequence is a robust built&#8208;in electric field, which tends to be 10.7&#8197;times higher in C60@NU&#8208;901 than that found in NU&#8208;901. In the catalyst, photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated and transported to the surface. For example, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaches 22.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for C60@NU&#8208;901, which is among the highest values for MOFs. Our concept of enhancing charge separation by harnessing host&#8208;guest interactions constitutes a promising strategy to design photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>Machine Learning Informs RNA&#8208;Binding Chemical Space
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA is increasingly considered a therapeutic target of interest for small molecules. We report an in&#8208;depth analysis of 36 high throughput small molecule microarray screens against nucleic acid targets. Development of machine learning algorithms revealed a complex set of physicochemical properties that can distinguish between RNA&#8208; and protein&#8208;binding drug&#8208;like small molecules.







Abstract
Small molecule targeting of RNA has emerged as a new frontier in medicinal chemistry, but compared to the protein targeting literature our understanding of chemical matter that binds to RNA is limited. In this study, we reported Repository Of BInders to Nucleic acids (ROBIN), a new library of nucleic acid binders identified by small molecule microarray (SMM) screening. The complete results of 36 individual nucleic acid SMM screens against a library of 24&#8201;572 small molecules were reported (including a total of 1&#8201;627&#8201;072 interactions assayed). A set of 2&#8201;003 RNA&#8208;binding small molecules was identified, representing the largest fully public, experimentally derived library of its kind to date. Machine learning was used to develop highly predictive and interpretable models to characterize RNA&#8208;binding molecules. This work demonstrates that machine learning algorithms applied to experimentally derived sets of RNA binders are a powerful method to inform RNA&#8208;targeted chemical space.

Record ultralarge&#8208;pores (47&#8197;&#197;), low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) three&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, TUS&#8208;64, was obtained by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. TUS&#8208;64 displayed the significant qualities of a drug delivery vehicle: controlled release kinetics, sustained delivery, and site&#8208;specific targeting.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) like high surface areas, interconnected pore system and readily accessible active sites render them promising platforms for a wide set of functional applications. Albeit promising, the reticular construction of 3D COFs with large pores is a very demanding task owing to the formation of interpenetrated frameworks. Herein we report the designed synthesis of a 3D non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, namely TUS&#8208;64, with the largest pore size of all 3D COFs (47&#8197;&#197;) and record&#8208;low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. Characterized with a highly interconnected mesoporous scaffold and good stability, TUS&#8208;64 shows efficient drug loading and controlled release for five different drugs in simulated body fluid environment, demonstrating the competency of TUS&#8208;64 as drug nanocarriers.

         <title>Predicting Highly Enantioselective Catalysts Using Tunable Fragment Descriptors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and robust predictive models using flexible 2D fragment descriptors, particularly suited for asymmetric catalysis, are described. From training data with only moderate selectivities, highly enantioselective catalysts were predicted and validated, enabling a catalytic asymmetric construction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydropyrans.







Abstract
Catalyst optimization processes typically rely on inductive and qualitative assumptions of chemists based on screening data. While machine learning models using molecular properties or calculated 3D structures enable quantitative data evaluation, costly quantum chemical calculations are often required. In contrast, readily available binary fingerprint descriptors are time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient, but their predictive performance remains insufficient. Here, we describe a machine learning model based on fragment descriptors, which are fine&#8208;tuned for asymmetric catalysis and represent cyclic or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, enabling robust and efficient virtual screening. Using training data with only moderate selectivities, we designed theoretically and validated experimentally new catalysts showing higher selectivities in a challenging asymmetric tetrahydropyran synthesis.

         <title>Correlating the Experimentally Determined CO Adsorption Enthalpy with the Electrochemical CO Reduction Performance on Cu Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectroscopic method was developed to measure the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces at electrochemical conditions. The adsorption enthalpy of CO on dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;VSHE was determined to be 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Measured CO adsorption enthalpies on two different Cu electrodes were correlated with their activities in the electrochemical reduction of CO.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been widely employed as a descriptor for effective catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR), however, it has yet to be determined experimentally at electrochemical interfaces due to the lack of suitable techniques. In this work, we developed a method to determine the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces with quantitative surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. On dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#8776;37.9&#177;13.4&#8197;J/(mol&#8201;K), and &#8776;&#8722;9.8&#177;4.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide&#8208;derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products. The method developed in this work will help establish the correlation between the CO binding energy and the CO(2)RR activity.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Bi Nanosheets Promote CO2&#8901;&#8722; Formation for High&#8208;Performance and pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a rational electronic structure manipulation strategy, electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets are obtained. Compared to electron&#8208;neutral Bi, the electron&#8208;rich Bi favors the formation of CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate to activate CO2 molecules, thus leading to its superior electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to chemical fuels such as formate offers a promising pathway to carbon&#8208;neutral future, but its practical application is largely inhibited by the lack of effective activation of CO2 molecules and pH&#8208;universal feasibility. Here, we report an electronic structure manipulation strategy to electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets, where electrons transfer from Cu donor to Bi acceptor in bimetallic Cu&#8722;Bi, enabling CO2RR towards formate with concurrent high activity, selectivity and stability in pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral and alkaline) electrolytes. Combined in situ Raman spectra and computational calculations unravel that electron&#8208;rich Bi promotes CO2&#8901;&#8722; formation to activate CO2 molecules, and enhance the adsorption strength of *OCHO intermediate with an up&#8208;shifted p&#8208;band center, thus leading to its superior activity and selectivity of formate. Further integration of the robust electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets into III&#8211;V&#8208;based photovoltaic solar cell results in an unassisted artificial leaf with a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate (STF) efficiency of 13.7&#8201;%.

         <title>Poly&#8208;Hydride [AuI7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 cluster complex: Structure, Transformation, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (Au7H52+), a poly&#8208;hydride AuI cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, is prepared. Upon exposure to light (300 to 450&#8197;nm) it decomposes to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (Au82+). The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2&#8201;% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5&#8201;%).







Abstract
Hydride AuI bonds are labile due to the mismatch in electric potential of an oxidizing metal and reducing ligand, and therefore the structure and structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanoclusters that contain them are seldom studied. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of [Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (abbrev. Au7H52+), an Au cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, which decomposed to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (abbrev. Au82+) upon exposure to light (300 to 450&#8197;nm). The valence state of AuI and H&#8722; was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, NMR, UV/Vis and XPS. The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2&#8201;% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5&#8201;%). Further DFT calculations showed that the H&#8722; ligand inhibited the CO2RR process compared with the electron&#8208;donor H.

         <title>One&#8208;Handed Helical Tubular Ladder Polymers for Chromatographic Enantioseparation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free tightly&#8208;twisted single&#8208;handed helical tubular ladder polymers with a highly &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity were synthesized thorough the quantitative and chemoselective helical ladderization of the rationally&#8208;designed precursor polymers. The resulting helical tubular ladder polymers showed remarkably high enantioseparation abilities toward a variety of chiral hydrophobic aromatics with point, axial, and planar chiralities.

Defect&#8208;free one&#8208;handed contracted helical tubular ladder polymers with a &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity were synthesized by alkyne benzannulations of the random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing 6,6&#8242;&#8208;linked&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol&#8208;based chiral monomer units. The resulting tightly&#8208;twisted helical tubular ladder polymers showed remarkably high enantioseparation abilities toward a variety of chiral hydrophobic aromatics with point, axial, and planar chiralities. The random&#8208;coil precursor polymer and analogous rigid&#8208;rod extended helical ribbon&#8208;like ladder polymer with no internal helical cavity exhibited no resolution abilities. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity formed in the tightly&#8208;twisted tubular helical ladder structures is of key importance for producing the highly&#8208;enantioseparation ability, by which chiral aromatics can be enantioselectively encapsulated by specific &#960;&#8208;&#960; and/or hydrophobic interactions.

         <title>Photocatalytic Carboxylation of C&#8722;N Bonds in Cyclic Amines with CO2 by Consecutive Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic carboxylation of C&#8722;N bonds in cyclic amines with CO2 is realized by consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (ConPET). This mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol provides a general and practical route to valuable &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208; and &#1013;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light photocatalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly important. However, it still remains challenging for reluctant substrates with low reduction potentials. Herein, we report a novel photocatalytic carboxylation of C&#8722;N bonds in cyclic amines with CO2 via consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (ConPET). It is also the first photocatalytic reductive ring&#8208;opening reaction of azetidines, pyrrolidines and piperidines. This strategy is practical to transform a variety of easily available cyclic amines to valuable &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208; and &#1013;&#8208;amino acids in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Moreover, the method also features mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, high selectivity, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, facile scalability and product derivations. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ConPET might be the key to generating highly reactive photocatalysts, which enable the reductive activation of cyclic amines to generate carbon radicals and carbanions as the key intermediates.

BTO/MoS2@CA, with the integration of charges&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity, pH&#8208;responsive CA release&#8208;mediated H2O2&#160;self&#8208;supply and GSH depletion, enables out&#8208;of&#8208;balance redox homeostasis, leading to effective tumor ferroptosis. As demonstrated by Yawei Lv, Xin Yu, Jing Liu, Chunying Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217448), charges are one of the important&#160;contributing factors for nanozyme activity, which has not been mentioned previously.

         <title>New Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes with High Lithium Ionic Conductivity &gt;10 mS/cm for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant interest as next&#8208;generation energy storage. Halides such as Li3YCl6 are promising candidates for SE because they combine high oxidation stability and deformability. However, the ionic conductivities of halide SEs are not as high as those of other SEs, especially sulfides. Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M = Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4 mS/cm for M = Nb and 12.4 mS/cm for M = Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Bulk&#8208;type ASSB cells using the oxyhalides as the cathode SE demonstrate an outstanding rate capability with a capacity retention of 80% at 5 C/0.1 C. We believe that the proposed oxyhalides are promising SE candidates for the practical applications of ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Salts as Dual&#8208;Function Reagents for Carboxylation and Carbon Isotope Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potassium salts of carboxylic acids are developed as efficient carboxylating agents through CO2 exchange. We describe these carboxylates as dual&#8208;function reagents because they function as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. By using the salt of a commercially available carboxylic acid, this protocol overcomes difficulties when using CO2 gas or organometallic reagents, such as pressurized containers or strictly inert conditions. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, does not require transition metals or other additives, and shows broad substrate scope. Through the preparation of several biologically important molecules, we show how this strategy provides an opportunity for isotope labeling with low equivalents of labeled CO2.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by biological helices (e.g., DNA), artificial helical polymers have attracted intense attention. However, precise synthesis of one&#8208;handed helices from achiral materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a series of achiral poly(biphenyl allene)s with controlled molar mass and low dispersity were prepared and induced into one&#8208;handed helices using chiral amines or alcohols. The induced one&#8208;handed helix was simultaneously memorized, even after the chiral inducer was removed. The switchable induction processes were visible to naked eye; the achiral polymers exhibited blue emission (irradiated at 365 nm), whereas the induced one&#8208;handed helices exhibited cyan emission with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The helices formed stable gels in various solvents with helicity discrimination ability: the same&#8208;handed helix gels were self&#8208;healing, whereas the gels of opposite&#8208;handed helicity were self&#8208;sorted. Moreover, the induced helices could separate enantiomers via enantioselective crystallization with high efficiency and switchable enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Enabling High Overall Nitrogen Fixation Performance for Atomically Dispersed Fe on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both NOR and NRR in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was firstly involved to inhibit the competitive OER and HER. Excitingly, an unanticipated yield of 7055.81 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. and 12868.33 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. were obtained for NOR and NRR at 3.5 V, respectively, 44.94 times and 7.8 times increase in FE than the conventional constant voltage electrocatalytic method. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the single&#8208;atom Fe could stabilize the oxygen vacancy, lower the energy barrier for the vital rupture of N&#8801;N, and result in enhanced N2 fixation performance. More importantly, PE could effectively enhance the N2 supply by reducing competitive O2 and H2 agglomeration, inhibit the electrocatalytic by&#8208;product formation for longstanding *OOH and *H intermediates, and promote the non&#8208;electrocatalytic process of N2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Super&#8208;Sized Metal Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Glass with Supramolecular Network via Suppressing Crystallization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy metal coordination compounds (MCC) [e.g., metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), coordination polymer, and metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex (MIOC)] are emerging members of the hybrid glass family. So far, a limited number of crystalline MCCs can be converted into glasses by the melt&#8208;quenching. Here, we report a universal wet&#8208;chemistry method, by which the super&#8208;sized supramolecular MIOC glasses can be synthesized from non&#8208;meltable MOFs. Alcohol and acid were used as agents to inhibit crystallization. The MIOC glasses demonstrate unique features including high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic network. Directional photoluminescence with a large polarization ratio (~47%) was observed from samples doped with organic dyes. This crystallization&#8208;suppressing approach enables fabrication of MCC glasses, which cannot be achieved by conventional vitrification methods, and thus allows for exploring new MCC glasses possessing photonic functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) Enables Mo6S8 with Fast Interfacial Magnesium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium (Mg) metal secondary batteries have attracted much attention for their high safety and high energy density characteristics. However, the significant issues of the cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Mg batteries are still being ignored. In this work, a significant CEI layer on the typical Mo6S8 cathode surface has been unprecedentedly constructed through the oxidation of the chloride&#8208;free magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2) salt under a proper charge cut&#8208;off voltage condition. The CEI has been identified to contain BxOy effective species originating from the oxidation of [B(hfip)4]&#8722; anion. It is confirmed that the BxOy species is beneficial to the desolvation of solvated Mg2+, speeding up the interfacial Mg2+ transfer kinetics, thereby improving the Mg2+&#8208;storage capability of Mo6S8 hosts. The firstly reported CEI in Mg batteries will give deeper insights into the interface issues in multivalent electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dinitrogen (N2) activation and functionalization is of fundamental interest and practical importance. This review focuses on N2 activation and addition to unsaturated substrates, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, heteroallenes, aldehydes, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes, mediated by transition metal complexes, which afforded a variety of N&#8211;C bond formation products. Emphases are placed on the reaction modes and mechanisms. We hope that this work would stimulate further explorations in this challenging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cascades Combining Biocatalysis and Transition Metal Catalysis for Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of catalytic methods provides multiple advantages in organic synthesis, allowing access to diverse organic molecules in a straightforward manner. Merging metal and enzyme catalysis is currently receiving great attention due to the possibility to assemble metal catalysis in C&#8211;C coupling, olefin metathesis, hydration and other reactions with the exquisite stereospecificity displayed by enzymes. Thus, this minireview is organized based on the action of the metal species (Pd, Ru, Au, Ir, Fe&#8230;) in combination with different enzymes. Special attention will be paid to the design of sequential processes and concurrent cascades, presenting solutions such as the use of surfactants or compartmentalization strategies for those cases where incompatibilities could hamper the overall process.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailorable and Biocompatible Supramolecular&#8208;Based Hydrogels Featuring two Dynamic Covalent Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has proven to be a valuable tool in creating fascinating molecules, structures, and emergent properties in fully synthetic systems. Here we report a system that uses two dynamic covalent bonds in tandem, namely disulfides and hydrazones, for the formation of hydrogels containing biologically relevant ligands. The reversibility of disulfide bonds allows fiber formation upon oxidation of dithiol&#8208;peptide building block, while the reaction between NH&#8208;NH2 functionalized C&#8208;terminus and aldehyde cross&#8208;linkers results in a gel.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has proven to be a valuable tool in creating fascinating molecules, structures, and emergent properties in fully synthetic systems. Here we report a system that uses two dynamic covalent bonds in tandem, namely disulfides and hydrazones, for the formation of hydrogels containing biologically relevant ligands. The reversibility of disulfide bonds allows fiber formation upon oxidation of dithiol-peptide building block, while the reaction between NH-NH2 functionalized C-terminus and aldehyde cross-linkers results in a gel. The same bond-forming reaction was exploited for the &#8220;decoration&#8221; of the supramolecular assemblies by cell-adhesion-promoting sequences (RGD and LDV). Fast triggered gelation, cytocompatibility and ability to &#8220;on-demand&#8221; chemically customize fibrillar scaffold offer potential for applying these systems as a bioactive platform for cell culture and tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exfoliated 2D Layered and Nonlayered Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides Nanosheets as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials catalysts provide an atomic scale view on fascinating arena for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR). Here, we successfully exfoliated both layered and nonlayered ultra&#8208;thin metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) nanosheets via wet grinding exfoliation (WGE), and systematically investigated the mechanism of MPCh3 as catalysts for CO2 ECR. Unlike the layered CoPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheets, the active Sn atoms tend to be exposed on the surfaces of nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets. Correspondingly, the nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets exhibit clearly improved catalytic activity, showing formic acid selectivity up to 31.6% with &#8208;7.51 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.65 V vs. RHE. The enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of HCOO* via the first proton&#8208;electron pair addition on the SnPS3 surface. These results provide a new avenue to understand novel CO2 ECR mechanism of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Co&#8208;storage in Porous Organic Frameworks through On&#8208;site Coulomb Interactions for High Energy and Power Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast and continuous ion insertion is blocked in the common electrodes operating with widely accepted single&#8208;ion storage mechanism, primarily due to Coulomb repulsion between the same ions. It results in an irreconcilable conflict between capacity and rate performance. Herein, we designed a porous organic framework with novel multiple&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage modes, including PF6&#8722;/Li+, OTF&#8722;/Mg2+, and OTF&#8722;/Zn2+ co&#8208;storage. The Coulomb interactions between cationic and anionic carriers in the framework can significantly promote electrode kinetics, by rejuvenating fast ion carrier migration toward framework interior. Consequently, the framework via PF6&#8722;/Li+ co&#8208;storage mode shows a high energy density of 878 Wh/kg cycled more than 20000 cycles, with an excellent power density of 28 kW/kg that is already comparable to commercial supercapacitors. The both greatly improved energy and power densities via the co&#8208;storage mode may pave a way for exploring new electrodes that are not available from common single&#8208;ion electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterodehalogenation Under Net Reductive or Redox&#8208;Neutral Conditions Enabled by Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interest in deuterated active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is increasing as deuteration holds promise for kinetic isotope effect (KIE) regulated fine&#8208;tuning of API performance. Moreover, deuterium isotope labeling is frequently carried out to study organic and bioorganic reaction mechanisms and to facilitate complex target synthesis. As such, methods for highly selective deuteration of organic molecules are highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the selective deuterodehalogenation of benzylic halides via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, using inexpensive deuterium oxide (D2O) as the deuterium source. We demonstrate broad functional group compatibility across a range of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides. Furthermore, we uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates simply by changing the identity of the sacrificial reductant employed.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;Fueled Transient Breathing Nanogels that Couple Nonequilibrium Catalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a "breathing"&#160;nanogel that is fueled by CO2 gas to perform temporally programmable catalytic polymerization. The nanogel is composed of common frustrated Lewis pair polymers (FLPs). Dynamic CO2&#8208;FLP gas&#8208;bridging bonds endow the nanogel with a transient volume contraction, and the resulting proximal effect of bound FLPs unlocks its catalytic capacity toward CO2. Reverse gas depletion via a CO2&#8208;participated polymerization can induce a reverse nanogel expansion, which shuts down the catalytic activity. Control of external factors (fuel level, temperature or additives) can regulate the breathing period, amplitude and lifecycle, so as to affect the catalytic polymerization. Moreover, editing the nanogel breathing procedure can sequentially evoke the copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxide monomers preloaded therein, which allows to obtain block&#8208;tunable copolycarbonates that are unachievable by other methods. This synthetic dissipative system would be function as a prototype of gas&#8208;driven nanosynthesizer.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Weak Solvating Molecule Regulation for Stable Li Deposition in High&#8208;Performance Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8211;O2 batteries with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte are promising because TFSI&#8208;IL can stabilize O2&#8211; to lower charge overpotential. However, slow Li+ transport in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte causes inferior Li deposition. Here we optimize weak solvating molecule (anisole) to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic aggregate in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte. Such unique solvation environment can realize not only high Li+ transport parameters but also anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Thus, fast Li+ transport is achieved in electrolyte bulk and SEI simultaneously, leading to robust Li deposition with high rate capability (3 mA cm&#8211;2) and long cycle life (2000 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8211;2). Moreover, Li&#8211;O2 batteries show good cycling stability (a small overpotential increase of 0.16 V after 120 cycles) and high rate capability (1 A g&#8211;1). This work provides an effective electrolyte design principle to realize stable Li deposition and high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated Long Persistent Luminescence of Organic Inorganic Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials of SrAl2O4 doped with Eu2+ or Dy3+ can maintain emission over hours after ceasing the excitation but suffer from insolubility, high cost, and harsh preparation. Recently, organic LPL of guest&#8208;host exciplex systems has been demonstrated via an intermediate charge&#8208;separated state with flexible design but poor air&#8208;stability. Here, we synthesized a nontoxic two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic metal hybrid halides (OIMHs), called PBA2[ZnX4] with X = Br or Cl and PBA = 4&#8208;phenylbenzylamine. These materials exhibit stable LPL emission over minutes at room&#8208;temperature, which is two orders of magnitude longer than those of previously reported OIMHs. The mechanism study shows that the LPL emission comes from thermally activated charge separation state rather than room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Moreover, the LPL of PBA2[ZnX4] can be excited by low power sources, representing an effective strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;stability LPL systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical interfacial polymerization toward ultrathin COF membranes for brine desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are urgently demanded in molecular/ionic separations. Herein, we reported an electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy to fabricate ultrathin COF membranes with thickness of 85 nm, by actively manipulate self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect. The resulting COF membrane exhibited superior performance in brine desalination with the permeation flux of 92 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and the rejection of 99.96%. Our electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy enriches the fabrication approach of COF membranes and facilitates the rational design of ultrathin membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Atomically Dispersed Sn Protuberance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed metal catalysts show potential advantages in N2 reduction reaction (NRR) due to their excellent activity and efficient metal utilization. Unfortunately, the reported catalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory NRR activity due to their poor N2 adsorption and activation. Herein, we report a novel Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by coordination with substrate C and O to induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and NRR performance. The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra confirmed the local coordination structure of the Sn ADPs. NRR activity was significantly promoted via Sn ADPs, exhibiting a remarkable NH3 yield (RNH3) of 28.3 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 (7447 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgSn&#8208;1) at &#8208;0.3 V. Furthermore, the enhanced N2Hx intermediates was verified by in situ experiments, yielding consistent results with DFT calculation. This work opens a new avenue to regulate the activity and selectivity of N2 fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>The rigid core and flexible surface of amyloid fibrils probed by Magic&#8208;Angle Spinning NMR of aromatic residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8208;&#8208;protein interactions. By studying a pair of structurally homologous cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid fibrils, HET&#8208;s and HELLF, with a specific isotope&#8208;labeling approach and magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning (MAS) NMR, we have characterized the dynamic behavior of Phe and Tyr aromatic rings to show that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of "breathing motions" over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips, on a variety of time scales from ns to &#181;s. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic&#8208;core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from a NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross&#8208;&#946; architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic Borromean Rings and [2]Catenanes Featuring Di&#8208; NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvophobic effects have been shown to play a crucial role in the formation and stability of a series of organometallic Borromean rings (BRs) and [2]catenanes prepared from benzobiscarbene complexes. The stability of the interlocked species in solution is related to the lengths of the N&#8208;alkyl substituents at the benzobiscarbene linkers, with longer N&#8208;alkyl substitutes improving the stability of the BRs and enhancing the proportion of [2]catenanes in solution.







Abstract
We report herein a series of organometallic Borromean rings (BRs) and [2]catenanes prepared from benzobiscarbene ligands. The reaction of dinickel complexes of the benzobiscarbenes 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c with a thiazolothiazole bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 led by self&#8208;assembly to a series of organometallic BRs. Solvophobic effects played a crucial role in the formation and stability of the interlocked species. The stability of BRs is related to the N&#8208;alkyl substituents at the precursors 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, where longer alkyl substitutes improve stability and inter&#8208;ring interactions. Solvophobic effects are also important for the stability of [2]catenanes prepared from 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c and a flexible bipyridyl ligand L3. In solution, an equilibrium between the [2]catenanes and their macrocyclic building blocks was observed. High proportions of [2]catenanes were obtained in concentrated solutions or polar solvents. The proportion of [2]catenanes in solution could be further enhanced by lengthening of the N&#8208;alkyl substitutes.

         <dc:description>Bimetallic electrocatalysts with its superior performance has a broad application prospect in oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER), but the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect&#160;is still&#160;limited&#160;since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influence factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others. Herein, a series of bimetallic Co&#8208;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) model OER catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers on&#160;OER&#160;performance. The coupling strength was regulated by adjusting the spacing between metal centers or the conjugation degree of bridge skeleton. Among the examined 2DPs,&#160;CoTAPP&#8208;Ni&#8208;MF&#8208;2DP, which has the strongest coupling strength between metal centers&#160;exhibited the best OER performance. These model systems can help to explore the precise structure&#8211;performance relationships, which is important for the&#160;rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically recyclable polyethylene&#8208;like sulfur&#8208;containing plastics from sustainable feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The green revolution in plastics should be accelerated due to growing sustainability concerns. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable polymers from the first reported cascade polymerization of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. In addition to abundant feedstocks, the method is efficient and air&#8208;tolerant, uses common organic bases as catalysts, and yields polymers with high molecular weights under mild conditions. Such polymers, structurally like polyethylene with low&#8208;density in&#8208;chain polar groups, manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to high&#8208;density polyethylene. The in&#8208;chain ester group acts as a breaking point, enabling these polymers to undergo chemical recycling through two loops. The structures and properties of these polymers also have an immeasurably expanded range owing to the versatility of our method. The readily available raw materials, facile synthesis, and high performance make these polymers promising prospects as sustainable materials in practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Enforced Electronic&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Formation in Water for Photochemical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amino alcohol meglumine solubilizes organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes of haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles or thiols, which are not observed in organic solvents. UV&#8208;A photoinduced electron transfer within the EDA complexes induces the mesolytic cleavage of the halide ion and radical recombination of the arenes leading, after rearomatization and proton loss to C&#8211;C or C&#8211;S coupling products. Depending on the substitution pattern selective and unique cross&#8208;couplings are observed. UV and NMR measurements reveal the importance of the assembly for the photoinduced reaction. Enforced EDA aggregate formation in water allows new activation modes for organic photochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic&#160;Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on MBenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the great feasibility of MBenes as a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). As a proof of concept,&#160;FeB2&#160;is first employed as a model MBene catalyst for the NO3RR, showing a maximum NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% with a corresponding NH3&#160;yield of 25.5 mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8208;2&#160;at&#160;&#8208;0.6 V vs. RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the exceptional NO3RR activity of FeB2&#160;arises from the tandem catalysis mechanism, that is, B sites activate NO3&#8208;&#160;to form intermediates, while Fe sites dissociate H2O and increase *H&#160;supply on&#160;B sites to promote the intermediate hydrogenation&#160;and enhance the&#160;NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3&#160;conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flipper probes have been introduced as small molecule fluorophores to image physical forces, that is, membrane tension in living systems.&#160; Their emergence over one decade is described, from evolutions in design and synthesis to spectroscopic properties.&#160; Responsiveness to physical compression in equilibrium at the ground state is identified as the ideal origin of mechanosensitivity to image membrane tension in living cells.&#160; A rich collection of flippers is described to deliver and release in any subcellular membrane of interest in a leaflet&#8208;specific manner.&#160; Chalcogen&#8208;bonding cascade switching and dynamic covalent flippers are developed for super&#8208;resolution imaging and dual&#8208;sensing of membrane compression and hydration.&#160; Availability and broad use in the community validate flipper probes as a fine example of the power of translational supramolecular chemistry, moving from fundamental principles to success on the market.</dc:description>

         <title>NH4+ Deprotonation at Interfaces Induced Reversible H3O+/NH4+ Co&#8208;insertion/Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion insertions always involve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface process, desolvation for instance, which determines the electrochemical kinetics. However, it's still a challenge to achieve fast ion insertion and investigate ion transformation at interface. Herein, the interface deprotonation of NH4+ and the introduced dissociation of H2O molecules to provide sufficient H3O+ to insert into materials' structure for fast energy storages are revealed. Lewis acidic ion&#8211;NH4+ can, on one hand provide H3O+ itself via deprotonation, and on the other hand hydrolyze with H2O molecules to produce H3O+. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8211;Fourier transform infrared ray method probed the interface accumulation and deprotonation of NH4+, and density functional theory calculations manifested that NH4+ tend to thermodynamically adsorb on the surface of monoclinic VO2, and deprotonate to provide H3O+. In addition, the inserted NH4+ have a positive effect for stabilizing the VO2(B) structure. Therefore, high specific capacity (&gt; 300 mAh g&#8722;1) and fast ionic insertion/extraction (&lt; 20 s) can be realized in VO2(B) anode. This interface derivation proposes a new path for designing proton ion insertion/extraction in mild electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Design of Chain&#8208;Growth Click Polymerization Based on a Thiol&#8208;Michael Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization is challenging yet desirable in modern polymer chemistry. In this work, we reported a novel chain&#8208;growth click polymerization based on the thiol&#8208;Michael reaction. This polymerization could be performed efficiently under ambient conditions and spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, allowing the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers in excellent yields and high molecular weights. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the thiolate addition to the Michael acceptor is the rate&#8208;determining step, and introducing the phenyl group could facilitate the chain&#8208;growth process. This polymerization is a new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization, which will provide a unique approach to creating functional polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Preferential Adsorption of Ethylene Oxide on Fe and Chlorine on Ni Enabled Scalable Electrosynthesis of Ethylene Chlorohydrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial manufacturing of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) critically requires excess corrosive hydrochloric acid or hypochlorous acid with dealing with massive by&#8208;products and wastes. Here we report a green and efficient electrosynthesis of ECH from ethylene oxide (EO) with NaCl over a NiFe2O4 nanosheet anode. Theoretical results suggest that EO and Cl preferentially adsorbed on Fe and Ni sites, respectively, collaboratively promoting the ECH synthesis. A Cl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening process is proposed and confirmed, and the key Cl and carbon radical species are identified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. This strategy can enable scalable electrosynthesis of 185.1 mmol of ECH in 1 h with 92.5% yield at a 55 mA cm&#8208;2 current density. Furthermore, a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols with good to high yields and paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid via respectively load and unload Cl are achieved, showing the promising potential of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Cu Nanoparticles for the Low&#8208;temperature Photo&#8208;driven Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of water molecules in thermal catalysis typically requires high temperatures, representing an obstacle to catalyst development for the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Plasmonic photocatalysis allows activation of water at low temperatures through the generation of light&#8208;induced hot electrons. Herein, we report a layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived copper catalyst (LD&#8208;Cu) with outstanding performance for the low&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;driven WGSR. LD&#8208;Cu offered a lower activation energy for WGSR to H2 under UV&#8208;Vis irradiation (1.4 W cm&#8208;2) compared to under dark conditions. Detailed experimental studies revealed that highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles created an abundance of hot electrons during light absorption, which promoted *H2O dissociation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway, leading to the efficient production of H2. Results demonstrate the benefits of exploiting plasmonic phenomena in the development of photo&#8208;driven low&#8208;temperature WGSR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendronized DNA Chimeras Harness Scavenger Receptors To Degrade Cell Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bispecific&#160;chimeras bridging cell membrane proteins with lysosome&#8208;trafficking receptors (LTRs) provide an&#160;effective therapeutic approach through lysosomal degradation of disease&#8208;relevant targets. Here,&#160;we report a&#160;novel&#160;dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy&#160;that uses a dendritic DNA to&#160;engage&#160;cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) as LTR. Using bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to conjugate the dendritic DNA with protein binder, the resulting DENTAC is able to&#160;traffic the protein target into the lysosome for elimination. We demonstrated the utility of DENTAC by degrading oncogenic&#160;membrane nucleolin (NCL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The anti&#8208;cancer application of NCL&#8208;targeting DENTAC was validated in a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer. This work thus presents a new avenue for rapid development of potent degraders against membrane proteins, with also broad research and therapeutic prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of the alternating copolymerization mechanism of epoxides or aziridines with cyclic anhydrides in the presence of halide salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic halide salts in combination with metal or Lewis acids are the most common and essential catalysts in ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP). However, the role of organic halide salts was neglected. Here, we have uncovered the complex behavior of organic halide in ROCOP of epoxides or aziridines with cyclic anhydrides. Coordination of the chain&#8208;end cations, electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, leaving ability of halide atoms, chain&#8208;end basicity/nucleophilicity, and terminal steric hindrance cause three types of side reactions: single&#8208;site transesterification, substitution, and elimination. Understanding the complex functions of organic halide salts in ROCOP led us to develop highly active and selective aminocyclopropenium chlorides as catalysts/initiators. Adjustable H&#8208;bonding interactions of aminocyclopropenium with propagating anions and epoxides create chain&#8208;end coordination processes that generate highly reactive carboxylate and highly selective alkoxide chain ends.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadiene and Methylcyclopentadiene with Xylose or Extracted Hemicellulose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) are important intermediates that have been widely used in the production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rocket fuels, polymers and valuable chemicals. Currently, CPD and MCPD are produced from fossil energies at very low yields, which greatly limits their application. As a solution to this problem, we disclose an alternative two&#8208;step bio&#8208;route to access CPD and MCPD using xylose or extracted hemicellulose as the feedstock. In the first step, cyclopentanone (CPO) was directly produced by the selective hydrogenolysis of xylose or extracted hemicellulose over a commercial Ru/C catalyst in an acid&#8208;free toluene/NaCl aqueous solution biphasic system. In the second step, CPO was selectively converted to CPD by a cascade hydrodeoxygenation/dehydrogenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts. When methanol was introduced with CPO and hydrogen, MCPD was selectively obtained by a cascade dehydrogenation/aldol condensation/selective hydrodeoxygenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Live&#8208;Cell Labeling with Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags Enables Long&#8208;Term High&#8208; and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (~0.006&#160;s&#8208;1) and reHaloTagF (~0.055&#160;s&#8208;1). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3&#8208;time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved. These applications highlight the potential of reHaloTag labeling for pushing the limits of advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Assisted Thermal Atomization of Palladium Clusters: A Hint for Rational Design of Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation from metal nanocluster catalysts to metal single&#8208;atom catalysts is an important procedure in the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs). However, the conversion methods often involve high annealing temperature as well as reducing atmosphere. Herein, we reported a continuous and convenient conversion of Pd nanocluster to Pd single&#8208;atom in a ligand assisted annealing procedure, by which means we reduced its activating temperature low to 400 &#176;C. Using ex&#8208;situ microscopy and spectroscopy, we comprehensively monitored the structural evolution of Pd species though the whole atomization process. Theoretical calculation revealed that the structural instability caused by remaining Cl ligands was the main reason for this low&#8208;temperature transformation. The present atomization strategy and mechanistic knowledge for the conversion from cluster to atomic dispersion provides guidelines for the rational design of ADCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I) Photocatalyzed Bromonitroalkylation of Olefins: Evidence for Highly Efficient Inner&#8208;Sphere Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the visible light&#8208;mediated copper&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of olefins utilizing bromonitroalkanes as ATRA reagents. This protocol is characterized by high yields and fast reaction times under environmentally benign reaction conditions with exceptional scope, allowing the rapid functionalization of both activated and unactivated olefins. Moreover, late&#8208;stage function&#173;nalization of biologically active molecules and upscaling to gram quantities is demonstrated, which offers manifold possibilities for further transformations, e.g. access to nitro&#8208; and aminocyclo&#173;propanes. Besides the synthetic utility of the title transformation, this study undergirds the exclusive role of copper in photoredox catalysis showing its ability to stabilize and interact with radical intermediates in its coordination sphere. EPR studies suggest that such interactions can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of transient to persis&#173;tent radicals contrasting iridium&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>An Isotope&#8208;Labeled Single&#8208;Cell Raman Spectroscopy Approach for Tracking the Physiological Evolution Trajectory of Bacteria toward Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding evolution of antibiotic resistance is vital for containing its global spread. Yet our ability to in situ track highly heterogenous and dynamic evolution is very limited. Here, we present a new single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis, and genotypic profiling to in situ track physiological evolution trajectory toward resistance. Physiological diversification of individual cells from isogenic population with cyclic ampicillin treatment is captured. Advanced multivariate analysis of spectral changes classifies all individual cells into four subsets of sensitive, intrinsic tolerant, evolved tolerant and resistant. Remarkably, their dynamic shifts with evolution are depicted and spectral markers of each state are identified. Genotypic analysis validates the phenotypic shift and provides insights into the underlying genetic basis. The new platform advances rapid phenotyping resistance evolution and guides evolution control.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF&#8208;67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF&#8208;67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF&#8208;67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF&#8208;67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176 &#177; 12 nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF&#8208;67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of direct proof in either natural or synthetic systems for trans dinitrosyl hemes, a key intermediate in the reactions of heme proteins (e.g. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), cytochrome c&#8217; and So H&#8208;NOX) with nitric oxide (NO), has hampered understanding on the exact reaction mechanisms, e.g. the formation of the five&#8208;coordinate heme complex with NO at the proximal side (5c NOP). In this work, we report the first isolation of the dinitrosyl metalloporphyrin complex, a six&#8208;coordinate, low spin {MnNO}7 species [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] (TPP2&#8210; = meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin dianion). The complex shows distinct features such as the elongated axial bond (1.877(9) vs. 1.641(5) &#197;), higher NO stretching bond position (1760 vs. 1735 cm&#8210;1) and isotropic resonance at g = 2.0, sharp contrast to those of five&#8208;coordinate mono&#8208;nitrosyl analogs. In situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) and EPR studies which gave deep insights into the reaction processes exhibits different responds of porphyrinates to NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Emerging Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vastness of organic synthetic strategies and knowledge of reticular chemistry have made covalent organic frameworks (COFs) one of the most chemically and structurally diverse class of material with potential applications ranging from gas storage, molecular separation, and catalysis to energy storage and magnetism. Recently, this class of porous material has garnered increasing interest as potential nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Traditionally, inorganic crystals, small molecule organic chromophores, and oligomers have been studied for their NLO response. Nevertheless, COFs offer significant advantages over existing NLO materials in terms of higher mechanical strength, thermo&#8208;chemical stability, and extended conjugation. Herein, we have discussed the crucial aspects, terminology, and measurement techniques related to NLO, followed by a critical analysis of the designing principles that lead to COFs with NLO response. Further, we touched on selected potential applications of these NLO materials. In the end, we presented a dedicated outlook section, wherein the future prospects and challenges of COFs as NLO material have been discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Thioketonates: A New Class of S,O&#8208;Chelated Boranes as Acceptors in Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class tetra&#8208;coordinated boranes namely boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones, which exhibit outstanding bulk electron mobility, photoresponse and tunable luminescence.







Abstract
Development of new n&#8208;type semiconductors with tunable band gap and dielectric constant has significant implication in dissociating bound charge carrier relevant for demonstrating high performance optoelectronic devices. Boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates (MTDKB), analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones were synthesized. Bulk transport measurement exhibited an outstanding bulk electron mobility of &#8776;0.003&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is among the best values reported till date in these class of semiconducting materials and correspondingly a single junction photo responsivity of upto 6&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 was obtained. This new family of O,S&#8208;chelated boron compounds exhibited luminescence in the far red/near&#8208;infrared region. The remarkable red shift of 89&#8197;nm (fluorescence) observed for 4&#8201;a in comparison with analogues boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonate signifies the importance of sulfur in these molecules. MTDKBs with amine functionality have also been investigated as an ON/OFF fluorescent sensor.

         <title>Photochemical Processes of Superbase Generation in Xanthone Carboxylic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysics and photochemistry of XnAA&#8208;TBD photobase generator along with the rate constants of intersystem crossing and internal conversion underlying the release of TBD by a photodecarboxylation process occurring from T2 with a rate constant of 2.2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photobase generators are species that allow the photocatalysis of various reactions, such as thiol&#8208;Michael, thiol&#8208;isocyanate, and ring&#8208;opening polymerization reactions. However, existing compounds have complex syntheses and low quantum yields. To overcome these problems, photobase generators based on the photodecarboxylation reaction were developed. We synthesized and studied the photochemistry and photophysics of two xanthone photobase, their carboxylic acid precursors, and their photoproducts to understand the photobase generation mechanism. We determined accurate quantum yields of triplet states and photobase generation. The effect of the intermediate radical preceding the base release was demonstrated. We characterized the photophysics of the photobase by femtosecond spectroscopy and showed that the photodecarboxylation process occurred from the second excited triplet state with a rate constant of 2.2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photobase generators are species that allow the photocatalysis of various reactions, such as thiol-Michael, thiol-isocyanate, and ring-opening polymerization reactions. However, existing compounds have complex syntheses and low quantum yields. To overcome these problems, photobase generators based on the photodecarboxylation reaction were developed. We synthesized and studied the photochemistry and photophysics of two xanthone photobase, their carboxylic acid precursors, and their photoproducts to understand the photobase generation mechanism. We determined accurate quantum yields of triplet states and photobase generation. The effect of the intermediate radical preceding the base release was demonstrated. We characterized the photophysics of the photobase by femtosecond spectroscopy and showed that the photodecarboxylation process occurred from the second excited triplet state with a rate constant of 2.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Microporosity in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of porosity beyond the microporous regime in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs) will trigger a shift in porous materials, rendering fascinating and unique opportunities in many applications. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of meso&#8208; and/or macroporous and hierarchical POMMs, highlighting some of their current applications.







Abstract
Porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) are a novel class of porous materials that cover a wide range of organic&#8208;based molecular building blocks connected through weak supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Despite of their diverse chemical and structural nature, common features to POMMs include solution processability, crystallinity and microporosity. Herein, we focus, for the first time, on the advance of the field of POMMs beyond the archetypical microporosity. In particular, we highlight relevant examples of meso&#8208; and macroporous POMMs, as well as hierchachical ones (micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;, micro&#8208;/macro&#8208; and meso&#8208;/macroporous). We also remark some of their unique properties, and how they can be key in many applications.

         <title>Discovery of Potent and Exquisitely Selective Inhibitors of Kinase CK1 with Tunable Isoform Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly identified chemical biology probes MU1250, MU1500, and MU1742, based on the 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;imidazole scaffold, allow for highly specific targeting of the isoforms CK1&#945;, CK1&#948;, and CK1&#1013; in cells as well as in vivo. Our observations suggest that the central scaffold can be used more broadly in compounds targeting other protein kinases, as evidenced by the highly selective p38&#945; inhibitor MU1299.







Abstract
Casein kinases 1 (CK1) are key signaling molecules that have emerged recently as attractive therapeutic targets in particular for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Herein, we report the identification of a new class of potent and highly selective inhibitors of CK1&#945;, &#948; and &#1013;. Based on their optimal in vitro and in vivo profiles and their exclusive selectivity, MU1250, MU1500 and MU1742 were selected as quality chemical probes for those CK1 isoforms. At proper concentrations, MU1250 and MU1500 allow for specific targeting of CK1&#948; or dual inhibition of CK1&#948;/&#1013; in cells. The compound MU1742 also efficiently inhibits CK1&#945; and, to our knowledge, represents the first potent and highly selective inhibitor of this enzyme. In addition, we demonstrate that the central 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;imidazole pharmacophore can be used as the basis of highly selective inhibitors of other therapeutically relevant protein kinases, e.g. p38&#945;, as exemplified by the compound MU1299.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, a Binary Fe/As Zintl Cluster With an Fe3 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binary iron arsenide cluster, [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, contains a triangular Fe3 core with short Fe&#8722;Fe bonds.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis and structural characterization of the first binary iron arsenide cluster anion, [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, present in both [K([2.2.2]crypt)]3[Fe3(As3)3(As4)] (1) and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]3[Fe3(As3)3(As4)]&#8901;en (2). The cluster contains an Fe3 triangle with three short Fe&#8722;Fe bond lengths (2.494(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.459(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.668(2)&#8197;&#197; for 1, 2.471(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.473(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.660(1)&#8197;&#197; for 2), bridged by a 2&#8208;butene&#8208;like As4 unit. An analysis of the electronic structure using DFT reveals a triplet ground state with direct Fe&#8722;Fe bonds stabilizing the Fe3 core.

         <dc:description>
Small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 with high chemomechanical reliability is constructed, and exhibits high&#8208;rate capacities, long&#8208;duration life, and low thermal activity under highly delithiated states for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance Li&#8208;ion batteries as competitive cathodes.







Abstract
High voltage can cost&#8208;effectively boost energy density of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes based Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but compromises their mechanical, electrochemical and thermal&#8208;driven stability. Herein, a collaborative strategy (i.e., small single&#8208;crystal design and hetero&#8208;atom doping) is devised to construct a chemomechanically reliable small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (SS&#8208;MN6) operating stably under high voltage (&#8805;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). The substantially reduced particle size combined with Mo6+ doping absorbs accumulated localized stress to eradicate cracks formation, subdues the surface side reactions and lattice oxygen missing meanwhile, and improves thermal tolerance at highly delithiated state. Consequently, the SS&#8208;MN6 based pouch cells are endowed with striking deep cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance capability. The contribution here provides a promising way to construct advanced cathodes with superb chemomechanical stability for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Reveals High Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using mass spectrometry and biological techniques, we found that H2O2 is dysregulated in PDAC, further validating that the main reasons for H2O2 enrichment in PDAC cells may be that oncogenic KRAS mutation promoted H2O2 production and silenced CAT levels in PDAC. Furthermore, we identified that H2O2 affects the cells&#8217; metabolic profile and promotes the survival of PDAC cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for many cellular functions, and dysregulation of ROS involves the development of multiple types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, ROS have been grouped into a single biochemical entity for a long time, and the specific roles of certain types of ROS in tumor cells (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) have not been systematically investigated. In this work, a highly sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry&#8208;based method was applied to study PDAC cells of humans and of genetically modified animals. The results show that the oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than superoxide or hydroxyl radicals in pancreatic cancer cells. We further identified that the enriched H2O2 modifies cellular metabolites and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings highlight the specific roles of H2O2 in pancreatic cancer development, which may provide new directions for pancreatic cancer therapy.

         <title>Stress&#8208;Induced Inversion of Linear Dichroism by 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Rotation in a Superelastic Organic Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine molecule in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular trimer can be rotated 90&#176; around the hydrogen bonds, leading to a single&#8208;crystal superelastic deformation associated with a reversible inversion of linear dichroism spectra.







Abstract
The molecular crystals that manifest unusual mechanical properties have attracted growing attention. Herein, we prepared an organic single crystal that shows bidirectional superelastic transformation in response to shear stress. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions revealed this crystal&#8208;twinning related shape change is owed to a stress&#8208;controlled 90&#176; rotation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine around the hydrogen bonds of a chiral organic trimer. As a consequence of the 90&#176; shift in the aromatic plane, an interconversion of crystallographic a&#8208;, b&#8208;axes (a&#8594;b&#8242; and b&#8594;a&#8242;) was detected. The molecular rotations changed the anisotropic absorption of linearly polarized light. Therefore, a stress&#8208;induced inversion of linear dichroism spectra was demonstrated for the first time. This study reveals the superior mechanical flexibilities of single crystals can be realized by harnessing the molecular rotations and this superelastic crystal may find applications in optical switching and communications.

         <title>Concerted and Selective Electrooxidation of Polyethylene&#8208;Terephthalate&#8208;Derived Alcohol to Glycolic Acid at an Industry&#8208;Level Current Density over a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Concerted and selective electro&#8208;reforming of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into high&#8208;value glycolic acid and H2 fuel was achieved at an industry&#8208;level current density (600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.15&#8197;V vs. RHE) by a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200&#8197;h can be achieved in a flow electrolyzer, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of Polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into fine chemicals and H2 is an ideal solution to address severe plastic pollution. Here, we report the electrooxidation of EG to glycolic acid (GA) with a high Faraday efficiency and selectivity (&gt;85&#8201;%) even at an industry&#8208;level current density (600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.15&#8197;V vs. RHE) over a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200&#8197;h can be achieved, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical results reveal that 1)&#8197;the OH* generation promoted by Ni(OH)2 plays a critical role in facilitating EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA oxidation and removing poisonous carbonyl species, thereby achieving high activity and stability; 2)&#8197;Pd with a downshifted d&#8208;band center and the oxophilic Ni can synergistically facilitate the rapid desorption and transfer of GA from the active Pd sites to the inactive Ni sites, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and thus achieving high selectivity.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Supramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Superstructures for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic superstructures are designed, which empower high&#8208;kinetics Grotthuss proton conduction to deeply access build&#8208;in protophilic oxygen motifs via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron (de)coordination reaction, endowing the assembled Zn&#8208;organic battery ultrahigh energy density, superior rate capacity and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability.







Abstract
With fast (de)coordination kinetics, the smallest and the lightest proton stands out as the most ideal charge carrier for aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction is particularly suitable for organic cathodes, yet not reported. We report the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of cyanuric acid and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triamine into organic superstructures through in&#8208;plane H&#8208;bonds and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The supramolecular superstructures exhibit highly stable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks with an ultralow activation energy for protonation (0.09&#8197;eV vs. 0.25&#8197;eV of zincification). Then, high&#8208;kinetics H+ coordination is prior to Zn2+ into protophilic C=O sites via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron reaction. The assembled ZOBs show high&#8208;rate capability (135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 150&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), high energy density (267&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode) and ultra&#8208;long life (50&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), becoming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs in comprehensive performances.

         <title>Polar Phosphorus Chalcogenide Cage Molecules: Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Properties in Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar phosphorus chalcogenide cages (&#946;&#8208;P4S3, &#946;&#8208;P4S4, &#946;&#8208;P4Se3, &#946;&#8208;P4Se4) with strong hyperpolarizabilities as functional molecules are introduced into inorganic adducts, resulting in four high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical materials. Among them, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 exhibits the largest second harmonic generation response (3.5&#215;AGS @ 2&#8197;&#956;m) in inorganic adducts.







Abstract
Inorganic adducts are an emerging class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)3(P4S4), (CuI)3(P4Se4), (CuBr)7(P4S3)3 and (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05&#8197;&#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts. Our study confirms that introducing NLO&#8208;active cage molecules into adducts is an efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

&lt;p&gt;Polar phosphorus chalcogenide cages (&#946;-P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &#946;-P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &#946;-P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &#946;-P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with strong hyperpolarizabilities as functional molecules are introduced into inorganic adducts, resulting in four high-performance IR nonlinear optical materials. Among them, (CuBr)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the largest second harmonic generation response (3.5&#215;AGS @ 2&#8197;&#956;m) in inorganic adducts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic adducts are an emerging class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), (CuI)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), (CuBr)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (CuBr)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05&#8197;&#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts. Our study confirms that introducing NLO-active cage molecules into adducts is an efficient strategy for high-performance NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyridine Dimers and Their Low&#8208;Temperature Isomerization: A High&#8208;Resolution Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution IR spectra in Ne matrices in alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations give evidence for a hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure as lowest&#8208;energy form of the pyridine dimer.







Abstract
The bonding between two neutral aromatic compounds, especially small ones, has been controversially debated in the last decades, and terms like &#8220;&#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; had to be revised. Surprisingly, despite of many experimental and computational work, there is still no clear consensus about the structure of and the bonding in the pyridine dimer. In this work, for different isomeric forms of the pyridine dimer, the structures and bonding were elucidated by combining high&#8208;resolution matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic results with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. High&#8208;resolution IR spectra of Ne matrices at 4&#8197;K containing pyridine were recorded for different concentrations and upon annealing to 10 and 12&#8197;K, relying on three isotopologues of pyridine. The spectra show the presence of hydrogen&#8208;bonded, T&#8208;shaped, and stacked forms of weakly&#8208;bound pyridine dimers. Among these, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded isomer is identified as the lowest&#8208;energy form. The results provide for the first time conclusive information about the interaction between two pyridine dimers.

         <title>Modulating Thermal Properties of Polymers through Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of multicomponent solids involving both small and polymeric molecules resulted in the preparation of cocrystals with melting points higher than the melting point of the pure polymer. At the same time, the high mechanical flexibility of the polymer is maintained even under harsh milling conditions, allowing the formation of toroidal nanoparticles with small inner radii and high curvatures.







Abstract
Crystal engineering has exclusively focused on the development of advanced materials based on small organic molecules. We now demonstrate how the cocrystallization of a polymer yields a material with significantly enhanced thermal stability but equivalent mechanical flexibility. Isomorphous replacement of one of the cocrystal components enables the formation of solid solutions with melting points that can be readily fine&#8208;tuned over a usefully wide temperature range. The results of this study credibly extend the scope of crystal engineering and cocrystallization from small molecules to polymers.

         <title>Revealing the Formation Mechanism and Optimizing the Synthesis Conditions of Layered Double Hydroxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a way to investigate the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on layered double hydroxide (LDH) formation. The results revealed the formation mechanism of LDHs and also guided the synthesis of a library of LDHs with desired attributes, in water at room temperature without using any additives.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), whose formation is strongly related to OH&#8722; concentration, have attracted significant interest in various fields. However, the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on LDHs&#8217; formation has not been fully explored due to the unsuitability of the existing synthesis methods for in situ characterization. Here, the deliberately designed combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a solution to the above problem. The obtained results revealed the formation mechanism and also guided us to synthesize a library of LDHs with the desired attributes in water at room temperature without using any additives. After evaluating their oxygen evolution reaction performance, we found that FeNi&#8208;LDH with a Fe/Ni ratio of 25/75 exhibits one of the best performances so far reported.
