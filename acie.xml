         <title>Monolayer&#8208;to&#8208;Multilayer Dimensionality Reconstruction in Hybrid Perovskite for Exploring Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Enables Passive X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide hybrid perovskites are attracting considerable attention as highly promising candidates for directly sensing X&#8208;ray radiation, but it remains great challenge to realize passive X&#8208;ray detection without external power supply. Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)&#160;in ferroelectrics promotes the independent separation of photoexcited carriers, which offer an unprecedented opportunity in this regard. Herein, by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (P&#8208;2D) monolayered perovskite (CH  3  OC  3  H  9  N)  2  PbBr  4  (  1  ), we successfully obtained a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) ferroelectric (CH  3  OC  3  H  9  N)  2  CsPb  2  Br  7&#160;  (  2  ), which is composed of bilayered perovskites sheets of corner&#8208;sharing PbBr  6  octahedra. Emphatically, converting P&#8208;2D into Q&#8208;2D perovskite arouses a significant BPVE associated with robust ferroelectricity, as well as enhanced mobility lifetime product. These features promise the fabrication of the first passive X&#8208;ray detector based on ferroelectrics with an impressive sensitivity up to 410 &#181;C Gy  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  &#160;at zero bias, which is even much superior to the value of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art  &#945;  &#8208;Se detector operated at relatively high bias. Our work demonstrates vast perspectives for the application of the ferroelectric semiconductors for photovoltaic electronic devices.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Halide hybrid perovskites are attracting considerable attention as highly promising candidates for directly sensing X-ray radiation, but it remains great challenge to realize passive X-ray detection without external power supply. Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)&#160;in ferroelectrics promotes the independent separation of photoexcited carriers, which offer an unprecedented opportunity in this regard. Herein, by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure-two-dimensional (P-2D) monolayered perovskite (CH  3  OC  3  H  9  N)  2  PbBr  4  (  1  ), we successfully obtained a quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D) ferroelectric (CH  3  OC  3  H  9  N)  2  CsPb  2  Br  7&#160;  (  2  ), which is composed of bilayered perovskites sheets of corner-sharing PbBr  6  octahedra.

These features promise the fabrication of the first passive X-ray detector based on ferroelectrics with an impressive sensitivity up to 410 &#181;C Gy  -1  cm  -2  &#160;at zero bias, which is even much superior to the value of state-of-the-art  &#945;  -Se detector operated at relatively high bias.

         <title>Standardization and Control of Grignard Reactions in a Universal Chemical Synthesis Machine using online NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A big problem with the chemistry literature is that it is not standardized with respect to precise operational parameters, and real time corrections are hard to make without expert knowledge. This lack of context means difficult reproducibility because many steps are ambiguous, and hence depend on tacit knowledge. Here we present the integration of online NMR into an automated chemical synthesis machine (CSM aka. &#8216;Chemputer&#8217; which is capable of small&#8208;molecule synthesis using a universal programming language) to allow automated analysis and adjustment of reactions on the fly. The system was validated and benchmarked by using Grignard reactions which were chosen due to their importance in synthesis. The system was monitored in real time using online&#8208;NMR, and spectra were measured continuously during the reactions. This shows that the synthesis being done in the Chemputer can be dynamically controlled in response to feedback optimizing the reaction conditions according to the user requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>High Mobility Organic Lasing Semiconductor with Crystallization&#8208;Enhanced Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high mobility organic laser semiconductors with strong emission is of great scientific and technical importance, but challenging. Herein, we present a high mobility organic laser semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) showing unique crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission guided by elaborately modulating its crystal growth process. The obtained one&#8208;dimensional nanowires of LD&#8208;1 show outstanding integrated properties including: high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching 80%, high charge carrier mobility of 0.08 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , Fabry&#8722;Perot lasing characters with a low threshold of 86 uJ cm  &#8208;2  and a high&#8208;quality factor of ~ 2400. Furthermore, electrically induced emission was obtained from an individual LD&#8208;1 crystal nanowire&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting transistor due to the recombination of holes and electrons simultaneously injected into the nanowire, which provides a good platform for the study of electrically pumped organic lasers and other related ultrasmall integrated electrical&#8208;driven photonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of n/p&#8208;type Phenothiazine Organic Scaffold for Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type or n&#8208;type redox reactions of organics are being used as the reversible electrodes to build the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with sustainable and tunable characteristics. However, the n&#8208;type organics that store cations generally exhibit low potential (&lt; 0.8 V vs. Zn/Zn  2+  ), while the p&#8208;type organics that store anions suffer from limited capacity (&lt; 100 mAh g  &#8208;1  ). Here we demonstrate that bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) containing both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (i.e., n/p&#8208;type at low potential + p&#8208;type at high potential) by using experiments and theoretical calculations. It is found that such hybrid mechanism combines the advantages of n and p&#8208;type reactions and compensates for the drawback of each other. Accordingly, the aqueous Zn//PTD&#8208;1 full cell shows a high voltage (e.g., 1.8 V  maximum  or 1.1 V  average  ), a high capacity 188.24 mAh g  PTD&#8208;1  &#8208;1  (achieved at 40 mA g  &#8208;1  ), a long&#8208;life and a supercapacitor&#8208;like high power. These results shed new light on the design of advanced organic electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Coordination Interphase Stabilizes Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high mechanical strength and incombustibility have great potential in completely addressing the safety issues of liquid batteries, but the poor interface contact between them and the electrodes hinders their practical applications. Here, coordination chemistry of nitrile groups based on succinonitrile (SCN) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is studied on the surface of Li  6.4  La  3  Zr  1.4  Ta  0.6  O  12  (LLZTO) SSE to build the chemical bonded electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The coordination of the nitrile group and LLZTO is clarified in detail by experiments and density functional theory calculations. And a deformable PAN&#8208;modifying SCN electrolyte (PSE) interphase with stable ionic conductivity (10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  ) and high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (0.66) is fabricated on the surface of LLZTO electrolyte based on the coordination competition of nitrile groups. Once applied to SSBs, it endows low interface resistance and strong bonding for the electrolyte/electrode interfaces so that the initial Coulomb efficiency reaches 95.6% and the capacity remains 99% after 250 cycles at 25  o  C.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;Porous metal&#8208;organic framework liquids for enhanced CO2 adsorption and catalytic conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique applications of porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) liquids with permanent porosity and fluidity have attracted significant attention. However, fabrication of porous MOF liquids remains challenging because of the easy intermolecular self&#8208;filling of the cavity or the rapid settlement of porous hosts in hindered solvents that cannot enter their pores. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the fabrication of a MOF liquid (Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL) by surface ionization of an imidazolium&#8208;functionalized framework with a sterically hindered poly(ethylene glycol) sulfonate (PEGS) canopy. The Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL obtained in this way has a CO2 adsorption approximately 14 times larger than that of pure PEGS. Distinct from a porous MOF solid counterpart, the stored CO2 in Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL can be slowly released and efficiently utilized to synthesize cyclic carbonates in the atmosphere. This is the first example of the use of a porous MOF liquid as a CO2 storage material for catalysis. It offers a new method for the fabrication of unique porous liquid MOFs with functional behaviors in various fields of gas adsorption and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Exquisite vesicular nanomedicine by paclitaxel mediated co&#8208;assembly with camptothecin prodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;component molecular drug amphiphiles often suffer from the suboptimal parameters during the self&#8208;assembly, resulting in the formation of tubes and/or filaments with lengths up to micrometers, which hampers the biomedical applications. Here, we report that the self&#8208;assembly of drug amphiphiles, Evans blue conjugated camptothecin prodrug (EB&#8208;CPT), can be modulated by another anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), resulting in ultrahigh quality of nanovesicles (NVs) with uniform shape and diameters of around 80 nm with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, denoted as ECX NVs. Significantly, the co&#8208;assembly of EB&#8208;CPT and PTX without adding other excipients has nearly 100% drug loading efficiency (DLE) and ultrahigh drug loading content (DLC) of PTX alone of up to 72.3 &#177; 1.7 wt% which, to our best knowledge, is among the highest level reported in literature. Moreover, the ECX NVs with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:2 showed remarkable combination index of 0.59 at a level of 50% efficacy against HCT116 cells in vitro and greatly improved tumor inhibition effect in vivo compared with two clinically approved CPT&#8208; and PTX&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines (Onivyde and Abraxane) individually and their combinations. This study presents a novel exquisite vesicular nanomedicine with ultrahigh DLC and DLE through a co&#8208;assembly strategy, which may shed new light on anticancer drug development and translational medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Dynamics, Structure and Magnetism of Switchable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via 1H&#8208;Detected MAS NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a toolbox for the rapid characterisation of powdered samples of paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks at natural abundance by  1  H detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Very fast (60 kHz) MAS rates at room and cryogenic temperatures and a set of tailored radiofrequency irradiation schemes are leveraged to overcome the sensitivity and resolution limits often associated with the characterization of new MOF materials. We demonstrate the approach on DUT&#8208;8(Ni), a framework containing Ni  2+  paddle&#8208;wheel units which can exist in two markedly different architec&#8208;tures. Resolved  1  H and  13  C resonances of organic linkers are detected and assigned in few hours with only 1&#8208;2 mg of sample at natural isotopic abundance, and used to rapidly extract important information on structure and local internal dynamics of the assemblies, as well as to elucidate the metal electronic properties over an extended temperature range. The experiments described disclose a wealth of new possibilities for describ&#8208;ing local and global structural changes and correlating them to electronic and magnetic properties of the assemblies, ultimately improving our ability to tune their macroscopic physicochemical behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycopolymer Microarrays with Sub&#8208;Femtomolar Avidity for Glycan Binding Proteins Prepared by Grafted&#8208;To/Grafted&#8208;From Photopolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel glycan array architecture that binds the mannose&#8208;specific glycan binding protein, concanavalin A (ConA) with sub&#8208;femtomolar avidity. A new radical photopolymerization developed specifically for this application combines the grafted&#8208;from thiol&#8208;(meth)acrylate polymerization with thiol&#8208;ene chemistry to graft glycans to the growing polymer brushes. The propagation of the brushes was studied by carrying out this grafted&#8208;to/grafted&#8208;from radical photopolymerization (GTGFRP) at &gt;400 different conditions using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization on surfaces. The effect of brush height and the grafting density of mannosides on the binding of ConA to the brushes was studied systematically, and we found that multivalent and cooperative binding account for the unprecedented sensitivity of the GTGFRP brushes. This study further demonstrates the ease with which new chemistry can be tailored for an application as a result of the advantages of hypersurface photolithography.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;nitroindoles with readily available allyl carbonates. Good yields (up to 86%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr) are obtained for a wide range of substrates. The compatibility of gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the relatively low catalyst loading (down to 1 mol% of [Pd]) enhance the practicality of this method. The kinetic experiments indicate that the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction is the nucleophilic attack of the alkoxide anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Self&#8208;oscillating Actuators with Phototactic Locomotion Based on Black Phosphorus Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing self&#8208;oscillating soft actuators that enable autonomous, continuous, and directional locomotion is significant in biomimetic soft robotics fields, but remains great challenging. Here, an untethered soft photoactuators based on covalently&#8208;bridged black phosphorus&#8208;carbon nanotubes heterostructure with self&#8208;oscillation and phototactic locomotion under constant light irradiation is designed. Owing to the good photothermal effect of black phosphorus heterostructure and thermal deformation of the actuator components, the new actuator assembled by heterostructured black phosphorus, polymer and paper produces light&#8208;driven reversible deformation with fast and large response. By using this actuator as mechanical power and designing a robot configuration with self&#8208;feedback loop to generate self&#8208;oscillation, an inchworm&#8208;like actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed. Moreover, due to the anisotropy and tailorablility of the actuator, an artificial crab robot that can simulate the sideways locomotion of crabs and simultaneously change color under light irradiation is also realized.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over cadmium single atom catalyst via tuning axial coordination structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2  to CO has attracted extensive attention because CO is viewed as the closest to commercialization among all products, which can be used in the synthesis of more complex carbon&#8208;based fuels or attractive feedstock. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered as a promising class of catalysts, for the maximum atom efficiency and high selectivity for many reactions. In this work, guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, it was found that the Cd SACs have excellent performance of activating CO2  , and introduction of axial coordination structure to Cd SACs cannot only further decrease the free energy barrier of CO2  reduction, but also suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on above discovery, we designed and synthesized a novel Cd SAC that comprises an optimized CdN4S1  moiety incorporated in carbon matrix. It was shown that the catalyst exhibited outstanding performance of CO2  electroreduction to CO. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO could reach up to 99.7% with a current density of 182.2 mA cm&#8208;2  in H&#8208;type electrolysis cell, and turnover frequency (TOF) value could achieve 73000 h&#8208;1  , which was much higher than that reported in the literature up to date. This work shows a successful example to design highly efficient catalysts with the guide of theoretical calculations.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of CO2  to CO has attracted extensive attention because CO is viewed as the closest to commercialization among all products, which can be used in the synthesis of more complex carbon-based fuels or attractive feedstock. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are considered as a promising class of catalysts, for the maximum atom efficiency and high selectivity for many reactions. In this work, guided by first-principles calculations, it was found that the Cd SACs have excellent performance of activating CO2  , and introduction of axial coordination structure to Cd SACs cannot only further decrease the free energy barrier of CO2  reduction, but also suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on above discovery, we designed and synthesized a novel Cd SAC that comprises an optimized CdN4S1  moiety incorporated in carbon matrix. It was shown that the catalyst exhibited outstanding performance of CO2  electroreduction to CO. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO could reach up to 99.7% with a current density of 182.2 mA cm-2  in H-type electrolysis cell, and turnover frequency (TOF) value could achieve 73000 h-1  , which was much higher than that reported in the literature up to date. This work shows a successful example to design highly efficient catalysts with the guide of theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermal Unequilibrium of PdSn Intermetallic Nanocatalysts: From In Situ Tailored Synthesis to Unexpected Hydrogenation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles are made through a rapid quenching method, inspired by in situ characterization results. PdSn shows unprecedented high hydrogenation selectivity of C=O over C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Effective control on chemoselectivity in the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O over C=C bonds is uncommon with Pd&#8208;based catalysts because of the favored adsorption of C=C bonds on Pd surface. Here we report a unique orthorhombic PdSn intermetallic phase with unprecedented chemoselectivity toward C=O hydrogenation. We observed the formation and metastability of this PdSn phase in situ. During a natural cooling process, the PdSn nanoparticles readily revert to the favored Pd3Sn2 phase. Instead, using a thermal quenching method, we prepared a pure&#8208;phase PdSn nanocatalyst. PdSn shows an &gt;96&#8201;% selectivity toward hydrogenating C=O bonds of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, highest in reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Further study suggests that efficient quenching prevents the reversion from PdSn&#8208; to Pd3Sn2&#8208;structured surface, the key to the desired catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations and analysis of reaction kinetics provide an explanation for the observed high selectivity.

         <title>Total Structure of Bimetallic Core&#8211;Shell [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; Nanocluster and Its Implications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic core&#8211;shell [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; nanocluster is synthesized and its structure is determined. The metal core possesses a Au42 core encaged by a shell of 40 cadmium atoms, which is protected by 52 thiolate ligands. The elucidation of this gold core/cadmium shell nanostructure expands the types of hetero&#8208;structured nanoclusters and promotes the understanding of bimetallic metal&#8208;metal bonding and interactions at the atomic level.







Abstract
Bimetallic core&#8211;shell nanostructures hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism. However, it remains a challenge to construct atomically precise core&#8211;shell with high&#8208;valence active metals on the gold surface. In this work, we report the total structure of a [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; core&#8211;shell nanocluster and multiple implications. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) reveals that the structure possesses a two&#8208;shelled Au6@Au36 core and a closed cadmium shell of Cd40, and the core&#8211;shell structure is then protected by 52 thiolate (&#8208;SR) ligands. The composition of the nanocluster is further confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS). A catalytic test for styrene oxidation and a comparison with relevant nanoclusters reveal the surface effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries enabled by Zincophilic&#8211;Zincophobic Interfacial Layers and Interrupted Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reversible Zn anode working at low temperature is achieved by introducing SnCl2 into eutectic ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte to form a zincophilic&#8211;zincophobic interfacial layer on the Zn anode in&#8197;situ. The bottom layer of Sn facilitates uniform Zn deposition, while the top layer of zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2 H2O facilitates Zn2+ diffusion and avoid Zn dendrites. The eutectic composition enhances the low temperature conductivity.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries promise high energy density but suffer from Zn dendritic growth and poor low&#8208;temperature performance. Here, we overcome both challenges by using an eutectic 7.6&#8197;m ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte with 0.05&#8197;m SnCl2 additive, which in situ forms a zincophilic/zincophobic Sn/Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O bilayer interphase and enables low temperature operation. Zincophilic Sn decreases Zn plating/stripping overpotential and promotes uniform Zn plating, while zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O top&#8208;layer suppresses Zn dendrite growth. The eutectic electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity of &#8776;0.8&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C due to the distortion of hydrogen bond network by solvated Zn2+ and Cl&#8722;. The eutectic electrolyte enables Zn&#8741;Ti half&#8208;cell a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of &gt;99.7&#8201;% for 200 cycles and Zn&#8741;Zn cell steady charge/discharge for 500&#8197;h with a low overpotential of 8&#8197;mV at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Practically, Zn&#8741;VOPO4 batteries maintain &gt;95&#8201;% capacity with a CE of &gt;99.9&#8201;% for 200 cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C, and retain &#8776;30&#8201;% capacity at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C of that at 20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Complex N&#8208;Glycans of the Parasite S. mansoni to Examine the Importance of Epitope Presentation on DC&#8208;SIGN recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular recognition of chemoenzymatically synthesized glycans derived from the parasitic worm S. mansoni by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN was investigated by a combination of NMR, computational and electron microscopy. It uncovered the importance of glycan complexity for lectin recognition including the influence of glycan valency, core xylosylation and length of oligo&#8208;LacNAc residues.







Abstract
The importance of multivalency for N&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions has primarily been studied by attachment of minimal epitopes to artificial multivalent scaffold and not in the context of multi&#8208;antennary glycans. N&#8208;glycans can be modified by bisecting GlcNAc, core xylosides and fucosides, and extended N&#8208;acetyl lactosamine moieties. The impact of such modifications on glycan recognition are also not well understood. We describe here a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide N&#8208;glycans expressed by the parasitic worm S. mansoni having unique epitopes at each antenna and containing core xyloside. NMR, computational and electron microscopy were employed to investigate recognition of the glycans by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN. It revealed that core xyloside does not influence terminal epitope recognition. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans bound with higher affinity to DC&#8208;SIGN compared to mono&#8208;valent counterparts, which was attributed to proximity&#8208;induced effective concentration. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans cross&#8208;linked DC&#8208;SIGN into a dense network, which likely is relevant for antigen uptake and intracellular routing.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network Determines the Early Photoisomerization Processes of Cph1 and AnPixJ Phytochromes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM calculations reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond networks interacting with the PCB chromophore governs the distinct excited&#8208;state relaxations of red&#8208;light photoreceptors Cph1 and AnPixJ. The present results contribute to decipher the natural evolution of both cyanobacteriochromes and phytochromes.







Abstract
Phytochrome proteins are light receptors that play a pivotal role in regulating the life cycles of plants and microorganisms. Intriguingly, while cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and cyanobacteriochrome AnPixJ use the same phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore to absorb light, their excited&#8208;state behavior is very different. We employ multiscale calculations to rationalize the different early photoisomerization mechanisms of PCB in Cph1 and AnPixJ. We found that their electronic S1, T1, and S0 potential minima exhibit distinct geometric and electronic structures due to different hydrogen bond networks with the protein environment. These specific interactions influence the S1 electronic structures along the photoisomerization paths, ultimately leading to internal conversion in Cph1 but intersystem crossing in AnPixJ. This explains why the excited&#8208;state relaxation in AnPixJ is much slower (ca. 100&#8197;ns) than in Cph1 (ca. 30&#8197;ps). Further, we predict that efficient internal conversion in AnPixJ can be achieved upon protonating the carboxylic group that interacts with PCB.

         <title>Molecular Plumbing to Bend Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced molecular plumbing of cyclic peptide nanotubes based on a [4+4] cycloaddition of anthracene moieties is described. The geometrical changes induced by the formation of the cycloadduct transfer to the supramolecular aggregate structural constrains that force the nanotube to bend.







Abstract
Light&#8208;induced molecular piping of cyclic peptide nanotubes to form bent tubular structures is described. The process is based on the [4+4] photocycloaddition of anthracene moieties, whose structural changes derived from the interdigitated flat disposition of precursors to the corresponding cycloadduct moieties, induced the geometrical modifications in nanotubes packing that provokes their curvature. For this purpose, we designed a new class of cyclic peptide nanotubes formed by &#946;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The presence of the former predisposes the peptide to stack in a parallel fashion with the &#946;&#8208;residues aligned along the nanotube and the homogeneous distribution of anthracene pendants.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Ambient Electrolytic Nitrogen Reduction for Hydrazine and Ammonia Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) system is presented. This system decouples the catalyst from the electrode, which gives the system huge versatility in catalyst design, loading and gas flow. By modifying the catalyst, either hydrazine or ammonium can be obtained selectively. The process has achieved ammonium production yield of 25.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 61&#8197;ppm ammonium can be accumulated by continuous operation.







Abstract
This work presents a redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) using polyoxometalate (POM) as the electron and proton carrier which frees the TiO2&#8208;based catalyst from the electrode and shifts the reduction of nitrogen to a reactor tank. The RM&#8208;eNRR process has achieved an ammonium production yield of 25.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 or 5.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an ammonium concentration of 6.7&#8197;ppm. With high catalyst loading, 61.0&#8197;ppm ammonium was accumulated in the electrolyte upon continuous operation, which is the highest concentration detected for ambient eNRR so far. The mechanism underlying the RM&#8208;eNRR was scrutinized both experimentally and computationally to delineate the POM&#8208;mediated charge transfer and hydrogenation process of nitrogen molecule on the catalyst. RM&#8208;eNRR is expected to provide an implementable solution to overcome the limitations in the conventional eNRR process.

         <title>Palladium/TY&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intermolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Aldehydes with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl disubstituted aldehydes with aryl bromides provides a rapid access to chiral aldehydes bearing an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in moderate to good yields with 50:50&#8211;97:3 er. Enantiomers were obtained efficiently with the same ligand by changing the functional groups of aryl bromides with aldehydes.







Abstract
Despite much progress has been made in the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation reactions of cyclic ketones, lactones and lactams, the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic carbonyl compounds lagged much behind due to the in situ generated Z/E&#8208;enolate intermediates leading to opposite enantiomers. Especially, the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic aldehydes is a long&#8208;standing challenge, because of the highest activity among carbonyl compounds leading to various competitive side reactions. Herein we reported an efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl disubstituted aldehydes with aryl bromides, which provides a rapid access to chiral aldehydes bearing an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in moderate to good yields with good er in most cases. In addition, a pair of enantiomers could be easily prepared with the use of the same ligand by exchanging the aryl groups of aldehyde and aryl bromide.

         <title>Transfer, Amplification, Storage, and Complete Self&#8208;Recovery of Supramolecular Chirality in an Achiral Polymer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage and complete self&#8208;recovery of supramolecular chirality in an absolute achiral azobenzene&#8208;containing polymer system is successfully achieved for the first time.







Abstract
Supramolecular chirality and its complete self&#8208;recovery ability are highly mystical in nature and biological systems, which remains a major challenge today. Herein, we demonstrate that partially cross&#8208;linked azobenzene (Azo) units can be employed as the potential chiral trigger to fully heal the destroyed helical superstructure in achiral nematic polymer system. Combining the self&#8208;assembly of Azo units and terminal hydroxyl groups in polymer side chains allows the vapor&#8208;induced chiral nematic phase and covalent fixation of the superstructure via acetal reaction. The induced helical structure of Azo units can be stored by inter&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking, even after removal of the chiral source. Most interestingly, the stored chiral information can trigger perfect chiral self&#8208;recovery (CSR) behavior after being destroyed by UV light, heat, and solvents. The results pave a new way for producing novel chiroptical materials with reversible chirality from achiral sources.

         <title>Enzyme Mimic Facilitated Artificial Cell to Mammalian Cell Signal Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Signal transfer from artificial cells to mammalian cells facilitated by artificial enzymes was demonstrated. Two metalloporphyrins were used to mimic the catalytic behavior of enzymes from the cytochrome P450 family. Hydrogel&#8208;based artificial cells containing these artificial enzymes were able to produce two fluorescent signaling molecules that could diffuse to mammalian HepG2 cells and led to distinguishable intracellular fluorescence.







Abstract
Catalyzing biochemical reactions with enzymes and communicating with neighboring cells via chemical signaling are two fundamental cellular features that play a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of organisms. Herein, we present an artificial enzyme (AE) facilitated signal transfer between artificial cells (ACs) and mammalian HepG2 cells. We synthesize metalloporphyrins (MPs) based AEs that mimic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) to catalyze a dealkylation and a hydroxylation reaction, exemplified by the conversion of resorufin ethyl ether (REE) to resorufin and coumarin (COU) to 7&#8208;hydroxycoumarin (7&#8208;HC), respectively. The AEs are immobilized in hydrogels to produce ACs that generate the two diffusive fluorophores, which can diffuse into HepG2 cells and result in dual intracellular emissions. This work highlights the use of AEs to promote AC to mammalian signal transfer, which opens up new opportunities for integrating the synthetic and living world with a bottom&#8208;up strategy.

         <title>Droplet Microfluidics and Directed Evolution of Enzymes: An Intertwined Journey</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From bulk emulsification to on&#8208;chip droplet formation and sorting, droplet microfluidics offers numerous tools for high&#8208;throughput screening. Directed evolution has greatly benefitted from these technological advances over the last twenty years. This review article gives a chronological overview of in vivo directed evolution of enzymes facilitated by droplet microfluidics.







Abstract
Evolution is essential to the generation of complexity and ultimately life. It relies on the propagation of the properties, traits, and characteristics that allow an organism to survive in a challenging environment. It is evolution that shaped our world over about four billion years by slow and iterative adaptation. While natural evolution based on selection is slow and gradual, directed evolution allows the fast and streamlined optimization of a phenotype under selective conditions. The potential of directed evolution for the discovery and optimization of enzymes is mostly limited by the throughput of the tools and methods available for screening. Over the past twenty years, versatile tools based on droplet microfluidics have been developed to address the need for higher throughput. In this Review, we provide a chronological overview of the intertwined development of microfluidics droplet&#8208;based compartmentalization methods and in vivo directed evolution of enzymes.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Organic Fluid Phosphorescence Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and effective strategy for the preparation of pure organic fluid materials with effective room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission was proposed. The material was observed to have moderate phosphorescent emission even at 85&#8201;&#176;C, based on which a temperature detection strategy was developed.







Abstract
It is an accepted approach to construct room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials by suppressing the non&#8208;radiative decay process. However, there is limited success in developing fluid phosphorescence materials owing to the ultrafast non&#8208;radiation relaxation of vibration and collision of molecules in fluid matrixes. Here, a universal deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent strategy is proposed for developing pure organic phosphorescent fluid materials that are able to generate effective phosphorescent emissions at both room temperature (&#934;RTP,293&#8201;K&#8776;30&#8201;%) and even higher temperature (&#934;RTP,358&#8201;K&#8776;4.53&#8201;%). Based on these findings, a qualitative analytical method was developed for leak detection and a quantitative analytical technique was further validated to help visually identify the heat distribution of irregular surfaces. This advancement empowers the current organic phosphorescent system offering an alternative to determine moisture and heat from non&#8208;invasive photoluminescence emission colors.

         <title>KIO4&#8208;mediated Selective Hydroxymethylation/Methylenation of Imidazo&#8208;Heteroarenes: A Greener Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, sustainable and chemoselective procedure for the C(sp2)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation and methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes, using KIO4 has been developed. In the presence of ethylene glycol, hydroxymethylated products were obtained in excellent yields, while the use of glycerol in the reaction resulted in the methylenated products. The reaction allows to access the most advanced intermediate of the drug Zolpidem.







Abstract
Herein, we report a KIO4&#8208;mediated, sustainable and chemoselective approach for the one&#8208;pot C(sp2)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation or methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes with formaldehyde, generated in situ via the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol or glycerol (renewable reagents) through the Malaprade reaction. In the presence of ethylene glycol, a series of 3&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes was obtained in good to excellent yields. These compounds are important intermediates to access pharmaceutical drugs, e.g., Zolpidem. Furthermore, by using glycerol, bis(imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methane derivatives were selectively obtained in good to excellent yields.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a new and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin construction, with full scope of proteinogenic amino acids and different ring sizes. Various bicyclic peptides can be created by dipyrrin&#8208;based crosslinking and double dipyrrin&#8208;ring formation. The embedded dipyrrin can be, respectively, either transformed to fluorescent BODIPY and then utilized as cancer&#8208;selective targeted protein imaging probe  in vitro  , or directly employed as a selective metal sensor in aqueous media. This work furnishes a valuable addition to the peptide macrocyclization toolbox and blueprints the development of multifunctional dipyrrin linkers in cyclopeptides for a wide range of potential bioapplications.</dc:description>

         <title>TEMPO Containing Radical Polymonothicarbonate Polymers with Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Regularities: Synthesis, Characterization, and Electrical Conductivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers bearing pendant radical functionalities have attracted much attention in recent years due to their wide spread applications, which span the areas of flexible magnetic, electronic and energy storage devices. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxidanyl) (TEMPO) appended polymonothiocarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of (4&#8208;glycidyloxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl) (GTEMPO) in the presence of carbonyl sulfide under ambient conditions. We have prepared the atactic and isotactic versions of this polymer, using enantiopure R or S forms of the GTEMPO monomer in the latter instances. All polymers were characterized by spectroscopic (IR, 1H and 13C NMR, EPR, MALDI) and thermal (TGA, DSC) techniques. Cyclic voltammetry studies of these polymers revealed both oxidation and reduction events that were characteristic of TEMPO radicals. The electrical conductivity studies of these polymers were conducted as solid&#8208;state films after annealing the samples above their glass transition temperatures. These studies revealed that at room temperature the isotactic polymer shows much greater conductivity (~ 10&#8208;4 S/cm) as compared to the atactic one (~ 10&#8208;7 S/cm), which can be attributed to the well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and hence regulated charge transport pathway of isotactic polymer chains in contrast to the irregular structure of the atactic counterpart.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Electrostatic Gating of Semi&#8208;Conducting Carbon Nanotubes by Controlling Protein Orientation in Biosensing Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to detect proteins through gating conductance via their unique surface electrostatic signature holds great potential for improving biosensing sensitivity and precision. Two challenges are: (1) defining the electrostatic surface of the incoming ligand protein presented to the conductive surface; (2) bridging the Debye gap so as to generate a measurable response. Here we report the construction of nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations; this allowed us to control the local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulate the conductance gating effect upon binding incoming protein targets. Using a b &#8208;lactamase binding protein (BLIP2) as the capture protein attached to carbon nanotube field effect transistors in different defined orientations, device conductance was influenced on binding TEM&#8208;1, an important b &#8208;lactamase involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Conductance increased or decreased depending on TEM&#8208;1 presenting either negative or positive local charge patches, demonstrating that local electrostatic properties, as opposed to protein net charge, act as the key driving force for electrostatic gating. This in turn can improve our ability to tune the gating of electrical biosensors toward optimized detection, including for AMR as outlined here.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Construction of Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomeric molecules have found proven applications and promising potentials in chemistry and medicines. The design of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed reactions in constructing atropisomerically enriched molecules emerged as an important research topic in recent years. These reactions include kinetic resolutions, asymmetric desymmetrizations, central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversions, and cycloadditions. This review evaluates and summarizes the progress on NHC organic catalysis for access to atropisomers, and briefly states our personal perspectives on the future advancement of this direction. NHC catalysis has provided rich and unique reaction modes with numerous success in asymmetric synthesis of central chiral molecules. It is expected that similar success can also be achieved in developing NHC catalysis to prepare atropisomeric molecules, including those not easily accessible with other methods. Readers in the broadly defined community of chemistry shall find this review as a valuable source for information and hopefully inspirations.</dc:description>

         <title>Active in sleep: Iron guanidine catalyst performs ROP on dormant side of ATRP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copolymers are the answer to property limitations of homopolymers. In order to use the full variety of monomers available, catalysts active in more than one polymerization mechanism are currently investigated. Iron guanidine catalysts have shown to be extraordinarily active in ROP of lactide and herein prove their versatility by also promoting ATRP of styrene. The presented iron complex is the first polymerizing lactide and styrene simultaneously to a defined block copolymer in a convenient one&#8208;pot synthesis. Both mechanisms work hand in hand with ROP using the dominantly present Fe  II  species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium. This orthogonal copolymerization by a benign iron catalyst opens up new pathways to biocompatible polymerization procedures broadening the scope of ATRP applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Significantly Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent covalent organic frameworks (COFs) find promising applications in chemical sensing, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices, however, the majority of COFs are non or weakly emissive owing to the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) or the molecular thermal motion&#8208;based energy dissipation. Here, we report a previously unperceived approach to improve luminescence performance of COFs by introducing isotope effect, which is achieved through substitution of hydrogen from high&#8208;frequency oscillators X&#8208;H (X = O, N, C) by heavier isotope deuterium. Combining the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; and in situ  deuteration methods generates the first deuterated COF, which exhibits an impressively 19&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield over that of the non&#8208;deuterated counterpart. These results are interpreted by theoretical calculations as the consequence of slower C/N&#8208;D and OD&#183;&#183;&#183;O vibrations that impede the nonradiative deactivation process. The proposed strategy is proved applicable to many other types of emissive COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Purely Covalent Cage with Homochirality by Imine Formation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral, anionic tetrahedral cage was self&#8208;assembled in water by condensing an anionic trisbenzaldehyde and a trisamine in a [4+4] manner, enantioselectively, with the help of templating by a chiral guest. The tetrahedron is remarkably stable and can accommodate a variety of guest molecules when in water.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of host molecules in aqueous media via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is well developed. However, the preparation of purely covalent counterparts in water has remained a formidable task. An anionic tetrahedron cage was successfully self&#8208;assembled in a [4+4] manner by condensing a trisamine and a trisformyl in water. Even although each individual imine bond is rather labile and apt to hydrolyze in water, the tetrahedron is remarkably stable or inert due to multivalence. The tetrahedral cages, as well as its neutral counterparts dissolved in organic solvent, have homochirality, namely that their four propeller&#8208;shaped trisformyl residues adopt the same rotational conformation. The cage is able to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of guest molecules in water. When a chiral guest was recognized, the formation of one enantiomer of the cage became more favored relative to the other. As a consequence, the cage could be produced in an enantioselective manner. The tetrahedron is able to maintain its chirality after removal of the chiral guest&#8212;probably on account of the cooperative occurrence of intramolecular forces that restrict the intramolecular flipping of phenyl units in the cage framework.

         <title>Successive Storage of Cations and Anions by Ligands of &#960;&#8211;d&#8208;Conjugated Coordination Polymers Enabling Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive storage of cations and anions was achieved by redox of only ligands, enabling robust sodium&#8208;ion batteries that show a much higher cyclability than in cases of storage of only cations by redox reactions of both ligands and metal ions.







Abstract
The oxidation of &#960;&#8211;d&#8208;conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) accompanied with anion insertion has the merits of increasing the capacity and elevating the discharge voltages. However, previous reports on this mechanism either required more investigations or showed low capacity and poor cyclablity. Herein, triphenylene&#8208;catecholate&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional CCPs are constructed by employing inactive transition&#8208;metal ions (Zn2+) as nodes, forming Zn&#8208;HHTP. Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate the successive storage of cations and anions by redox reactions of only ligands, leading to a high reversible capacity of &#8776;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 90&#8201;% after 1000 cycles. On the contrary, as a control experiment, the analogous CCPs (Cu&#8208;HHTP) with Cu2+ nodes, where both ligands and metal ions undergo redox reactions, accompanied by the storage of only Na+ cations, show a much poorer cyclability. These results highlight the importance of redox reactions of only ligands for long&#8208;term cycle life and the insight into the storage mechanisms deepens our understanding on CCPs for the further design of CCPs with high performance.

         <title>Cycloisomerization of Carbamoyl Chlorides in Hexafluorisopropanol: Stereoselective Synthesis of Chlorinated Methylene Oxindoles and Quinolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) as a reagent in the cycloisomerization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides is demonstrated. The chlorinated methylene oxindole products are obtained in excellent E&#8208;selectivities. This reactivity was also extended towards the synthesis of chlorinated methylene pyrrolidones and 2&#8208;quinolinones.







Abstract
Hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) was employed as an additive for the generation of 3&#8208;(chloromethylene)oxindoles via the chloroacylation of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides. This reaction avoids the use of a metal catalyst and accesses products in high yields and stereoselectivities. Additionally, this reaction is scalable and proved amenable to a series of product derivatizations, including the synthesis of nintedanib. The reactivity of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) was harnessed towards the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones.

         <title>The Copper Chaperone NosL Forms a Heterometal Site for Cu Delivery to Nitrous Oxide Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper metallochaperone NosL contains a heterobimetallic Zn,Cu site, where the redox&#8208;inert ZnII serves a structural role and prevents oxidation of the cysteine ligands. It also pre&#8208;forms the binding site for the cargo of the chaperone, a single CuI ion that is eventually transferred to the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase in the process of assembling its copper centres, CuA and CuZ.







Abstract
The final step of denitrification is the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2, mediated by Cu&#8208;dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR). Its metal centers, CuA and CuZ, are assembled through sequential provision of twelve CuI ions by a metallochaperone that forms part of a nos gene cluster encoding the enzyme and its accessory factors. The chaperone is the nosL gene product, an 18&#8197;kDa lipoprotein predicted to reside in the outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In order to better understand the assembly of N2OR, we have produced NosL from Shewanella denitrificans and determined the structure of the metal&#8208;loaded chaperone by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protein assembled a heterodinuclear metal site consisting of ZnII and CuI, as evidenced by anomalous X&#8208;ray scattering. While only CuI is delivered to the enzyme, the stabilizing presence of ZnII is essential for the functionality and structural integrity of the chaperone.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Osteopontin Fragment Orders During Interfacial Calcium Oxalate Mineralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;specific vibrational spectroscopy was applied to study the structure and interaction of central urinary osteopontin peptide at the air&#8211;water interface and during calcium oxalate mineralization. The interfacial peptides show ordered and assembled &#946;&#8208;turn motifs with binding of Ca2+ ions and CaC2O4 minerals, in contrast to the disordered peptide structure in bulk solution.







Abstract
Calcium oxalate (CaC2O4) is the major component of kidney stone. The acidic osteopontin (OPN) protein in human urine can effectively inhibit the growth of CaC2O4 crystals, thereby acting as a potent stone preventer. Previous studies in bulk solution all attest to the importance of binding and recognition of OPN at the CaC2O4 mineral surface, yet molecular level insights into the active interface during CaC2O4 mineralization are still lacking. Here, we probe the structure of the central OPN fragment and its interaction with Ca2+ and CaC2O4 at the water&#8211;air interface using surface&#8208;specific non&#8208;linear vibrational spectroscopy. While OPN peptides remain largely disordered in solution, our results reveal that the bidentate binding of Ca2+ ions refold the interfacial peptides into well&#8208;ordered and assembled &#946;&#8208;turn motifs. One critical intermediate directs mineralization by releasing structural freedom of backbone and binding side chains. These insights into the mineral interface are crucial for understanding the pathological development of kidney stones and possibly relevant for calcium oxalate biomineralization in general.

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Synthesis of Vicinal Diamines from Diols through Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8722;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.







Abstract
We present herein an unprecedented diastereoconvergent synthesis of vicinal diamines from diols through an economical, redox&#8208;neutral process. Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8722;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, the first enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.

         <title>Mobilization upon Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We all know that ice becomes liquid upon heating. In contrast, melting upon cooling is an unusual behavior. A system of molecules adsorbed to a surface, which become mobile upon cooling, was developed. The key for understanding these counterintuitive phase transitions lies in the fact that the high temperature ordered phase possesses more degrees of freedom leading to a larger entropy than the low&#8208;temperature unordered phase.







Abstract
Phase transitions between different aggregate states are omnipresent in nature and technology. Conventionally, a crystalline phase melts upon heating as we use ice to cool a drink. Already in 1903, Gustav Tammann speculated about the opposite process, namely melting upon cooling. So far, evidence for such &#8220;inverse&#8221; transitions in real materials is rare and limited to few systems or extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate an inverse phase transition for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Molybdenum tetraacetate on copper(111) forms an ordered structure at room temperature, which dissolves upon cooling. This transition is mediated by molecules becoming mobile, i.e., by mobilization upon cooling. This unexpected phenomenon is ascribed to the larger number of internal degrees of freedom in the ordered phase compared to the mobile phase at low temperatures.

A diastereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction was developed as an effective pathway to the core tetracyclic skeleton of Cephalotaxus diterpenoids. The construction of the tropone moiety was enabled by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/elimination protocol. Using the strategy, the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid&#8197;F, (+)&#8208;fortalpinoid&#8197;A, and (+)&#8208;cephinoid&#8197;H was accomplished for the first time.







Abstract
3&#8208;Deoxyfortalpinoid&#8197;F, fortalpinoid&#8197;A, and cephinoid&#8197;H are members of the Cephalotaxus diterpenoids class of natural products, which feature diverse chemical structures and valuable biological activities. We report herein the development of a diastereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction as an effective pathway to access the core tetracyclic skeleton, which is found widely in Cephalotaxus diterpenoids. Furthermore, we enabled the construction of the tropone moiety through a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/elimination protocol. Based on the developed strategy, asymmetric synthesis of the title compounds has been achieved for the first time.

         <title>Shadow Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy of Single Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (SECL) microscopy is based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting layer, allowing to resolve subcellular organelles such as single functional mitochondria with remarkably sharp negative optical contrast. The statistical analysis of colocalization between SECL spots with the MitoTracker Deep Red dye and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH fluorescent biomarkers validates the reported methodology.







Abstract
Mitochondria are the subcellular bioenergetic organelles. The analysis of their morphology and topology is essential to provide useful information on their activity and metabolism. Herein, we report a label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting reactive layer to image single living mitochondria deposited on the electrode surface. The ECL mechanism of the freely&#8208;diffusing [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye with the sacrificial tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine coreactant restrains the light&#8208;emitting region to a micrometric thickness allowing to visualize individual mitochondria with a remarkable sharp negative optical contrast. The imaging approach named &#8220;shadow ECL&#8221; (SECL) reflects the negative imprint of the local diffusional hindrance of the ECL reagents by each mitochondrion. The statistical analysis of the colocalization of the shadow ECL spots with the functional mitochondria revealed by classical fluorescent biomarkers, MitoTracker Deep Red and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH, validates the reported methodology. The versatility and extreme sensitivity of the approach are further demonstrated by visualizing single mitochondria, which remain hardly detectable with the usual biomarkers. Finally, by alleviating problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity associated with conventional microscopy methods, SECL microscopy should find promising applications in the imaging of subcellular structures.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly atropo&#8208;enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of tetralone derivatives paired with aryl boronic esters as nucleophilic components is presented The transformation is catalyzed by chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) iridium(III) complexes and enabled by oxidatively enhanced reductive elimination from high&#8208;valent cyclometalated Ir&#8208;species.







Abstract
Atropo&#8208;enantioselective biaryl coupling through C&#8722;H bond functionalization is an emerging technology allowing direct construction of axially chiral molecules. This approach is largely limited to electrophilic coupling partners. We report a highly atropo&#8208;enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of tetralone derivatives paired with aryl boronic esters as nucleophilic components. The transformation is catalyzed by chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) iridium(III) complexes and enabled by oxidatively enhanced reductive elimination from high&#8208;valent cyclometalated Ir&#8208;species.

         <title>Multienzyme One&#8208;Pot Cascades Incorporating Methyltransferases for the Strategic Diversification of Tetrahydroisoquinoline Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions were developed leading to the scalable synthesis of methylated tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The reactions occurred in one&#8208;pot starting from simple building blocks such as dopamine or L&#8208;tyrosine. The use of selected methyltransferases enabled regioselective methylations. When more than one catechol moiety was present, methylations could be directed towards one or more hydroxyl group.







Abstract
The tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) ring system is present in a large variety of structurally diverse natural products exhibiting a wide range of biological activities. Routes to mimic the biosynthetic pathways to such alkaloids, by building cascade reactions in vitro, represents a successful strategy and can offer better stereoselectivities than traditional synthetic methods. S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases are crucial in the biosynthesis and diversification of THIQs; however, their application is often limited in vitro by the high cost of SAM and low substrate scope. In this study, we describe the use of methyltransferases in vitro in multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, including for the generation of SAM in situ. Up to seven enzymes were used for the regioselective diversification of natural and non&#8208;natural THIQs on an enzymatic preparative scale. Regioselectivites of the methyltransferases were dependent on the group at C&#8208;1 and presence of fluorine in the THIQs. An interesting dual activity was also discovered for the catechol methyltransferases used, which were found to be able to regioselectively methylate two different catechols in a single molecule.

         <title>Dry Reforming of CH4/CO2 by Stable Ni Nanocrystals on Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline MgO Monoliths at Reduced Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles on porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths to enhance dry reforming of CH4/CO2 and present the quantitative syngas production with excellent durability after continuous operation of 500 hours at 650&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides a promising and economically feasible route for the large&#8208;scale carbon fixation; however, the coking and sintering of catalysts remain a fundamental challenge. Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles at the surface of porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths and show the quantitative production of syngas from dry reforming of CH4/CO2. We show the complete conversion of CH4/CO2 even only at 700&#8201;&#176;C with excellent performance durability after a continuous operation of 500&#8197;hours. The well&#8208;defined and catalytically active Ni&#8208;MgO interfaces facilitate the reforming reaction and enhance the coking resistance. Our findings would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the &#8220;Nanocrystal On Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Monoliths&#8221; technique could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.

         <title>Mechanochemical Reactivity of Bottlebrush and Dendronized Polymers: Solid vs. Solution States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers with ultrasonication (solution state) and ball&#8208;mill grinding (solid state) was explored. This study provides important insight into the influence of polymer architecture on mechanochemical reactions and the difference in reactivity that is observed in solution and solid states, which has important implications in the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.







Abstract
We explored the mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers in solution (with ultrasonication, US) and solid states (with ball&#8208;mill grinding, BMG). Over 50 polymers were prepared with varying backbone length and arm architecture, composition, and size. With US, we found that bottlebrush and dendronized polymers exhibited consistent backbone scission behavior, which was related to their elongated conformations in solution. Considerably different behavior was observed with BMG, as arm architecture and composition had a significant impact on backbone scission rates. Arm scission was also observed for bottlebrush polymers in both solution and solid states, but only in the solid state for dendronized polymers. Motivated by these results, multi&#8208;mechanophore polymers with bottlebrush and dendronized polymer architectures were prepared and their reactivity was compared. Although dendronized polymers showed slower arm&#8208;scission, the selectivity for mechanophore activation was much higher. Overall, these results have important implications to the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.

&lt;p&gt;The mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers with ultrasonication (solution state) and ball-mill grinding (solid state) was explored. This study provides important insight into the influence of polymer architecture on mechanochemical reactions and the difference in reactivity that is observed in solution and solid states, which has important implications in the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed, Reductive C(sp3)&#8722;Si Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Cyano Alkyl Electrophiles and Chlorosilanes</title>

         <dc:description>
An activated alkyl electrophile and a silicon electrophile can be reductively cross&#8208;coupled under nickel catalysis with elemental zinc as the stoichiometric reductant. This cross&#8208;electrophile coupling enables for the first time the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond from alkyl electrophiles with an &#945;&#8208;cyano group and chlorosilanes (see Scheme; dtbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl).







Abstract
A nickel/zinc&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of alkyl electrophiles activated by an &#945;&#8208;cyano group and chlorosilanes is reported. Elemental zinc is the stoichiometric reductant in this reductive coupling process. By this, a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond can be formed starting from two electrophilic reactants whereas previous methods rely on the combination of carbon nucleophiles and silicon electrophiles or vice versa.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Detected Pump&#8211;Probe Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy detected by fluorescence is introduced. Combining sensitive fluorescence detection with ultrafast pulse&#8208;limited time resolution, this approach provides a complementary technique to standard transient absorption.







Abstract
We introduce a new approach to transient spectroscopy, fluorescence&#8208;detected pump&#8211;probe (F&#8208;PP) spectroscopy, that overcomes several limitations of traditional PP. F&#8208;PP suppresses excited&#8208;state absorption, provides background&#8208;free detection, removes artifacts resulting from pump&#8211;pulse scattering, from non&#8208;resonant solvent response, or from coherent pulse overlap, and allows unique extraction of excited&#8208;state dynamics under certain conditions. Despite incoherent detection, time resolution of F&#8208;PP is given by the duration of the laser pulses, independent of the fluorescence lifetime. We describe the working principle of F&#8208;PP and provide its theoretical description. Then we illustrate specific features of F&#8208;PP by direct comparison with PP, theoretically and experimentally. For this purpose, we investigate, with both techniques, a molecular squaraine heterodimer, core&#8211;shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, and fluorescent protein mCherry. F&#8208;PP is broadly applicable to chemical systems in various environments and in different spectral regimes.

         <title>Stability and Optical Absorption of a Comprehensive Virtual Library of Minimal Eumelanin Oligomer Models**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand the details of eumelanin structure and relate the stability of its components with optical properties, we have studied a library of 830 minimal models of eumelanin components, dimers of 5,6&#8208;dihydroxy indole (DHI), with density functional theory. Our library considers all possible chemical diversity. The most stable dimers have polycyclic, oxidized structures and absorb as low as 1.3&#8197;eV (&#955;&gt;900&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Eumelanin is responsible for photoprotection in living organisms. It is made of 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole (DHI) oligomers. However, lack of detailed structural knowledge limits understanding its function and exploiting its potential in material science. To uncover the relationship between structural stability and optical properties, we have studied a virtual library of 830 DHI dimers. We find a preference for oxidized, polycyclic structures which speaks in favor of graphite&#8208;like structures for the larger oligomers, and propose an electrocyclic formation mechanism. Besides widely considered quinone oxidation patterns, also structures with interfragment double bonds and zwitterionic resonance structures are stable. Future theoretical melanine models will have to cover this diversity, and we introduce a new representative set of 49 stable dimers. Some stable oxidized dimers have absorption energies as low as 1.3&#8197;eV. They may be present as substructures in the naturally found oligomers and contribute to the absorption spectrum of the biopolymer.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of G&#8208;Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptor Polypharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;based modelling was used to design a single compound with the ability to modulate the activity of two G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors relevant for Parkinson's disease. The most potent scaffold displayed nanomolar binding affinities for both targets and was active in a rat model of parkinsonism.







Abstract
Many diseases are polygenic and can only be treated efficiently with drugs that modulate multiple targets. However, rational design of compounds with multi&#8208;target profiles is rarely pursued because it is considered too difficult, in particular if the drug must enter the central nervous system. Here, a structure&#8208;based strategy to identify dual&#8208;target ligands of G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors is presented. We use this approach to design compounds that both antagonize the A2A adenosine receptor and activate the D2 dopamine receptor, which have excellent potential as antiparkinson drugs. Atomic resolution models of the receptors guided generation of a chemical library with compounds designed to occupy orthosteric and secondary binding pockets in both targets. Structure&#8208;based virtual screens identified ten compounds, of which three had affinity for both targets. One of these scaffolds was optimized to nanomolar dual&#8208;target activity and showed the predicted pharmacodynamic effect in a rat model of Parkinsonism.

         <title>Consecutive Ligand&#8208;Based Electron Transfer in New Molecular Copper&#8208;Based Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of Cu&#8208;based complexes bearing dianionic bpy&#8208;amidate ligands have been prepared and characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. The new complexes are capable of performing water oxidation catalysis at overpotentials between 557&#8211;830&#8197;mV pH&#8197;11.6. A detailed electrocatalytic study in combination with computational calculations revealed the all ligand&#8208;based nature of the electron transfer processes involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Water oxidation to dioxygen is one of the key reactions that need to be mastered for the design of practical devices based on water splitting with sunlight. In this context, water oxidation catalysts based on first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are highly desirable due to their low cost and their synthetic versatility and tunability through rational ligand design. A new family of dianionic bpy&#8208;amidate ligands of general formula H2LNn&#8722; (LN is [2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxamide) substituted with phenyl or naphthyl redox non&#8208;innocent moieties is described. A detailed electrochemical analysis of [(L4)Cu]2&#8722; (L4=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarbonyl)bis(azanediyl))dibenzenesulfonate) at pH&#8197;11.6 shows the presence of a large electrocatalytic wave for water oxidation catalysis at an &#951;=830&#8197;mV. Combined experimental and computational evidence, support an all ligand&#8208;based process with redox events taking place at the aryl&#8208;amide groups and at the hydroxido ligands.

   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (LN is [2,2&#8242;-bipyridine]-6,6&#8242;-dicarboxamide) substituted with phenyl or naphthyl redox non-innocent moieties is described. A detailed electrochemical analysis of &lt;b&gt;[(L4)Cu]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (L4=4,4&#8242;-(([2,2&#8242;-bipyridine]-6,6&#8242;-dicarbonyl)bis(azanediyl))dibenzenesulfonate) at pH&#8197;11.6 shows the presence of a large electrocatalytic wave for water oxidation catalysis at an &#951;=830&#8197;mV. Combined experimental and computational evidence, support an all ligand-based process with redox events taking place at the aryl-amide groups and at the hydroxido ligands.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Robust Pseudocapacitive Sodium Cation Intercalation Induced by Cobalt Vacancies at Atomically Thin Co1&#8722;xSe2/Graphene Heterostructure for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co vacancies (VCo) at the interface of Co1&#8722;xSe2/graphene (GE) afford strong adsorption of Na+ and a low Na+ diffusion energy barrier to facilitate rapid intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ ions giving remarkable pseudocapacitance. The as&#8208;prepared Co1&#8722;xSe2/GE&#8208;based sodium ion batteries deliver high specific/rate capacity performance and exceptional cycling performance.







Abstract
Electronic structure engineering on electrode materials could bring in a new mechanism to achieve high energy and high power densities in sodium ion batteries. Herein, we design and create Co vacancies at the interface of atomically thin CoSe2/graphene heterostructure and obtain Co1&#8722;xSe2/graphene heterostructure electrode materials that facilitate significant Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the Na+ adsorption energy is dramatically increased, and the Na+ diffusion barrier is remarkably reduced due to the introduction of Co vacancy. The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C, excellent rate capability of 576.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8201;C and ultra&#8208;long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na+ storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies. This work suggests that the creation of cation vacancy could bestow heterostructured electrode materials with pseudocapacitive Na+ intercalation for high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate energy storage.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Embedded Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Redox Chemistry of Cyclothianthrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, [n]cyclothianthrenes, were successfully constructed and characterized. The reported synthetic strategy allows access to not only the smallest and most strained cyclothianthrene, but also unprecedented chiral belts including a M&#246;bius strip. Further studies reveal these belt&#8208;like molecules are redox&#8208;active and potential materials for host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclothianthrenes, a series of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts proposed a decade ago, were successfully constructed through a stepwise bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The belt [6]cyclothianthrene ([6]CT) is the smallest and most strained member of the family yet reported. Both [6]CT and [8]CT are the first examples of cyclothianthrene characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. An unprecedented chiral belt [7]CT and a M&#246;bius&#8208;shaped [9]CT were also achieved via modular synthesis. Crystallographic and computational studies show that belts [6]CT&#8208;[8]CT have prism&#8208;like conformations with well&#8208;defined tubular cavities which have potential for guest molecule inclusion. Cyclic voltammograms further revealed that these belts are redox&#8208;active. The success of constructing sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, that is, cyclothianthrenes, greatly enriches the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped molecular belts and tubes.

         <title>Macrodiolide Diversification Reveals Broad Immunosuppressive Activity That Impairs the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and flexible synthesis of macrodiolides related to the natural product vermiculine is described. A common building block prepared through a catalytic asymmetric route enabled various modifications to the scaffold and stereochemical flexibility. Partial blocking of the keto&#8208;enoate groups afforded the analogue LH519 (see structure), which exhibited broad inhibition of innate immune signaling pathways, including cGAS&#8208;STING, with minimal effects on cell viability.







Abstract
The development of new immunomodulatory agents can impact various areas of medicine. In particular, compounds with the ability to modulate innate immunological pathways hold significant unexplored potential. Herein, we report a modular synthetic approach to the macrodiolide natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;vermiculine, an agent previously shown to possess diverse biological effects, including cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity. The synthesis allows for a high degree of flexibility in modifying the macrocyclic framework, including the formation of all possible stereoisomers. In total, 18 analogues were prepared. Two analogues with minor structural modifications showed clearly enhanced cancer cell line selectivity and reduced toxicity. Moreover, these compounds possessed broad inhibitory activity against innate immunological pathways in human PBMCs, including the DNA&#8208;sensing cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Initial mechanistic characterization suggests a surprising impairment of the STING&#8208;TBK1 interaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Amidation of Light Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenative amidation of light alkanes C1&#8211;C4 has been accomplished using copper catalysis. This strategy has allowed establishing the relative reactivity of the C&#8722;H bonds of gaseous alkanes, which correlates with bond dissociation energy values.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in light alkanes, particularly to form C&#8722;N bonds, remains a challenge. We report the dehydrogenative coupling of amides with C1&#8211;C4 hydrocarbons to form N&#8208;alkyl amide products with tBuOOtBu as oxidant, and a copper complex of a phenanthroline&#8208;type ligand as catalyst. The reactions occurred in good yields in benzene or supercritical carbon dioxide as solvents. This strategy allowed for the determination of the relative reactivity of these alkane C&#8722;H bonds toward this amination process and showed, in contrast to prior work with larger alkanes, that the reactivity correlated with bond dissociation energies.

         <title>High&#8208;selective Supramolecule Array Membrane Made of Zero&#8208;dimensional Molecules for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of molecular sieve membranes using simple molecules as primary building blocks has the potential to revolutionize the architecture design of membranes, such as stacking modes, intercrystalline gaps, and mass&#8208;transfer channels, which is crucial to separation properties. Here, we orderly assemble zero&#8208;dimensional 2&#8208;methylimidazole (mim) molecules into unprecedented supramolecule array membranes (SAMs) through solvent&#8208;free vapor processing, realizing the intermolecular spacing of mim at ~0.30 nm available as size&#8208;sieving channels for distinguishing the tiny difference between H2 (kinetic diameter: 0.289 nm) and CO2 (kinetic diameter: 0.33 nm). The highly oriented and dense membranes yield a separation factor above 3600 for equimolar H2/CO2 mixtures, which is one order of magnitude higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes defining 2017&#8217;s upper bound for H2/CO2 separation. These SAMs define a new benchmark for molecular sieve membranes, and are of paramount importance to precombustion carbon capture. Given the range of supramolecules, we anticipate SAMs with variable intermolecular channels could be applied in diversified separations that are prevalent in chemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of serine proteases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bicyclic peptide scaffold was chemically adapted to generate diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of serine protease  Bos taurus  trypsin 1 (T1). Starting from a prototype molecule &#8211; sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (  SFTI&#8208;1  ) &#8211; we obtained light&#8208;controllable inhibitors of T1 with K  i  in the low nanomolar range, whose activity could be modulated over 20&#8208;fold by irradiation. The inhibitory potency as well as resistance to proteolytic degradation were systematically studied on a series of 17  SFTI&#8208;1  analogues. The hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the structure of inhibitors and possibly the enzyme&#8208;inhibitor binding dynamics were affected by isomerization of the photoswitch. The feasibility of manipulating enzyme activity in time and space was demonstrated by controlled digestion of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and an antimicrobial peptide BP100&#8208;RW. Finally, our design principles of diarylethene photoswitches are shown to apply also for the development of other serine protease inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Inherently Unstable Carbonyl Hypoiodites as Extremely Strong Neutral Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of neutral halogen&#8208;bonded O&#8211;I&#8211;N complexes were prepared from  in&#8208;situ  formed carbonyl hypoiodites and aromatic organic bases (pyridine, DMAP, 4&#8208;morpholinopyridine  and  4&#8208;piperidinopyridine). The carbonyl hypoiodites exhibit a very strongly polarized iodine atom with larger s &#8208;holes than any known uncharged halogen bond donor. The hypoiodite synthesized from trifluoroacetic acid has a s &#8208;hole of +234.55 kJ/mol, which surpasses the previously strongest XB donor  N  &#8208;iodosaccharin that had a value of +226.36 kJ/mol. Modulating the Lewis basicity of the selected pyridine derivatives and carboxylates leads to halogen&#8208;bonded complexes where the classical O&#8210;I&#183;&#183;&#183;N halogen bond transforms more into a halogen&#8208;bonded COO  &#8211;  &#183;&#183;&#183;I &#8211; N  +  ion&#8208;pair (salt) with a strongly asymmetric O &#8211; I &#8211; N moiety. Detailed single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses,  1  H&#8208;  15  N HMBC NMR studies, and DFT calculations reveal the halogen bonding geometries of the carbonyl hypoiodite&#8208;based O &#8211; I &#8211; N complexes, confirming that in the solid&#8208;state the iodine atom is located much closer to the N&#8208;atom of the pyridine derivatives than its original position at the carboxylate O&#8208;atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Picomole&#8208;scale synthesis and screening of macrocyclic compound libraries by acoustic liquid transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic compounds are an attractive class of therapeutic ligands against challenging targets such as protein&#8208;protein interactions. However, the development of macrocycles as drugs is hindered by the lack of large combinatorial macrocyclic libraries, which are cumbersome, expensive, and time consuming to make, screen, and deconvolute. Here, we established a strategy for synthesizing and screening combinatorial libraries on a picomolar scale using acoustic droplet ejection to combine building blocks at nanoliter volumes, which reduced reaction volumes, reagent consumption, and synthesis time. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we assembled a 2,700&#8208;member target&#8208;focused macrocyclic library that we could subsequently assay in the same microtiter synthesis plates, saving the need for additional transfers and deconvolution schemes. We screened the library against the MDM2&#8208;p53 protein&#8208;protein interaction and generated micromolar and sub&#8208;micromolar inhibitors. Our work synthesizing combinatorial macrocycle libraries at the picomole&#8208;scale using acoustic liquid transfer provides a general strategy towards macrocycle ligand development.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Tracking of Cell Viability for Adoptive Natural Killer Cell&#8208;based Immunotherapy by Ratiometric NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The therapeutic efficacy of natural killer (NK) cells&#8208;based immunotherapy is greatly related with the survival of transplanted NK cells. However, no effective strategy was reported to monitor NK cell viability in adoptive immunotherapy in vivo  . Herein, we develop a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging strategy to quantitively track and visualize the adoptive NK cell viability in vivo  in real&#8208;time. The nanoprobe consists of lanthanide&#8208;based down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP) coated with IR786s, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive to NIR dye, which was directly labeled with NK cells. Upon cell death, the excessive ROS generation occurred within NK cells, along with IR786s degradation, turning on NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal at1550 nm of DCNP under 808&#8208;nm excitation, while the fluorescent signal at 1550 nm of DCNP under 980&#8208;nm excitation was stable. Such an intracellular ROS&#8208;induced ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal was validated to correlate well with NK cell viability in vivo  . Using this nanoreporter, we further demonstrated that co&#8208;treatment with IL&#8208;2, IL&#8208;15, and IL&#8208;21 could improve NK cell viability in vivo  , achieving enhanced immunotherapy for orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, this strategy allows for longitudinal and quantitative tracking of NK cell viability in NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Stereoselectively inhibiting the nucleation and crystal growth of one enantiomer aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient method to obtain enantiopure compounds.

A library of supramolecular polymers made up of two vinyl polymers and 6 small molecules were applied with seeds in the selective crystallization of 7 racemates, which exhibited good to excellent stereoselectivity in yielding crystals with high enantiomeric purities. Thus, this approach fully takes advantage of the modular synthesis to conveniently, low&#8208;cost and rapidly screen of the additives.</dc:description>

         <title>[Ag(NH3)2]2SO4: A strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties to design nonlinear optical materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over recent decades, guided by the anionic group theory of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, rational design strategies have been primarily focused on anionic moieties; consequently, structural modification and design of cationic moieties have long been neglected. Herein,   we report a strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties that substantially enhances the nonlinear and linear optical properties of NLO materials. For an example with well&#8208;known crystal structure, [Ag(NH  3  )  2  ]  2  SO  4  ,  we demonstrate that the coordination of the Ag  +  cation by the neutral ligand drives the formation of a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal  P  2  1  c  structure as a positive uniaxial crystal.  The bending of the [Ag(NH  3  )  2  ]  +  cationic moiety  parallel to the  z&#8208;  axis generates an anisotropic arrangement of the dipoles, i.e., a dipole of 0.12 D along the  z  &#8208;direction, yet zero dipole in the  xy  &#8208;plane, which interacts anisotropically with the incident light oscillating electromagnetic wave, leading to optical anisotropy with a large birefringence. The incident beam of 589.3 nm normal to the (110) crystal plane measures &#8710;  n  obv.  = 0.08, and [Ag(NH  3  )  2  ]  2  SO  4  also exhibits a phase&#8208;matching NLO response 1.4 times that of KH  2  PO  4  (KDP) (  obv  . 1.4 &#215; KDP @1064 nm;  cal  .  d  36  = 1.50 pm/V). These discoveries will illuminate future explorations of other functional ionic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused&#8208;Nonacyclic Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Based on Ladder&#8208;Thiaborin Exhibiting Narrowband Sky&#8208;Blue Emission with Accelerated Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing organic luminophores with unique capability of strong narrowband emission is both crucial and challenging for the further advancement of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system (  BSBS&#8208;N1  ), which was strategically embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, was developed as a new multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. Narrowband sky&#8208;blue emission with a peak at 478 nm, full width at half maximum of 24 nm, and photoluminescence quantum yield of 89% was obtained with  BSBS&#8208;N1  . Additionally, the spin&#8208;orbit coupling was enhanced by incorporating two sulfur atoms, thereby facilitating the spin&#8208;flipping process between the excited triplet and singlet states. OLEDs based on  BSBS&#8208;N1  as a sky&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter achieved a high maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 21.0%, with improved efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Ketones Catalyzed by Engineered TrpB</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase (TrpB) catalyzes a PLP&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;substitution reaction between indole and serine to form L&#8208;Trp. A succession of TrpB protein engineering campaigns to expand the enzyme&#8217;s nucleophile substrate range has enabled the biocatalytic production of diverse non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs). Here, we show that ketone&#8208;derived enolates can serve as nucleophiles in the TrpB reaction to achieve the asymmetric alkylation of ketones, an outstanding challenge in synthetic chemistry. We engineered TrpB by directed evolution to catalyze the asymmetric alkylation of propiophenone and 2&#8208;fluoroacetophenone with a high degree of selectivity. In reactions with propiophenone, preference for the opposite product diastereomer emerges over the course of evolution, demonstrating that full control over the stereochemistry at the new chiral center can be achieved. The addition of this new reaction to the TrpB platform is a crucial first step toward the development of efficient methods to synthesize non&#8208;canonical prolines and other chirally dense nitrogen heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Modulation of Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Mediated Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the critical role played by carbon monoxide (CO) in physiological and pathological signaling events, current approaches to deliver this messenger molecule are often accompanied by off&#8208;target effects and offer limited control over release kinetics. To address these challenges, we developed an electrochemical approach that affords on&#8208;demand release of CO through reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) dissolved in the extracellular space. Electrocatalytic generation of CO by cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalysts modulates signaling pathways mediated by a CO receptor, soluble guanylyl cyclase. Furthermore, by tuning the applied voltage during electrocatalysis, we explore the effect of the CO release kinetics on CO&#8208;dependent neuronal signaling. Finally, we integrate components of our electrochemical platform into microscale fibers to produce CO in a spatially&#8208;restricted manner and to activate signaling cascades in the targeted cells. By offering on&#8208;demand local synthesis of CO, our approach may facilitate the studies of physiological processes affected by this gaseous molecular messenger.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;swelling gradient polyelectrolyte hydrogel membranes as high&#8208;performance osmotic energy generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging asymmetric ionic membranes consisting of two different porous membranes show great superiority in harvesting the clean and renewable osmotic energy. The main barriers constraining their applications are the incompatible interface and low interfacial ionic transport efficiency, detrimental to the long&#8208;term stability and improvement of power density. Here, the continuous gradient all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction&#8208;diffusion method have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. Besides of the inherent high ion conductivity and excellent ion selectivity, the anti&#8208;swelling gradient polyelectrolyte membranes reserve the ionic diode effect of the asymmetric membranes to facilitate one&#8208;way ion diffusion, but circumvent their adverse interfacial effect. In consequence, the gradient polyelectrolyte membrane&#8208;based generators can present ultrahigh power densities of 7.87 W/m  2  by mixing seawater and river water, far superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The design strategy in this study can provide new insights in constructing high&#8208;performance membranes for osmotic energy collection.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular activatable probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence play a critical role in in vivo imaging of biomarkers for drug screening and disease diagnosis. With structural diversity and high fluorescence quantum yields, hemicyanine dyes have emerged as a versatile scaffold for construction of activatable optical probes. This review presents a survey of hemicyanine&#8208;based NIR activatable probes (HNAPs) for in vivo imaging and early diagnosis of diseases. The molecular design principles of HNAPs towards activatable optical signaling against various biomarkers are discussed with a focus on their broad applications in detection of disease including inflammation, acute organ failure, skin diseases, intestinal diseases and cancer. These progresses not only proves the unique value of HNAPs in preclinical research but also highlight their high translational potential in clinical diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete self&#8208;assembled metallo&#8208;foldamers with heteroleptic sequence specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foldamers are molecular sequences which contain structural information: the shape they adopt in solution depends on the identity and the ordering of the components that comprise the sequence. As such the fidelity of the sequence is essential, and enables the reliable formation of secondary structures that act as the scaffolds to enable many molecular functions. Discrete and structurally diverse sequences are constructed in both natural and abiotic systems primarily using inert connectivity with irreversible organic covalent bonds, serving to preserve the identity of the sequence. The formation of sequences under thermodynamic control using labile coordination bonds would be attractive for synthetic ease and modular capability, but this presents issues regarding sequence preservation. Here is presented an approach integrating palladium(II) metal ions into the sequence itself, with fidelity maintained through use of complementary pairings of ligand arrangements at the metal centre. This is accomplished using sites of different denticity and/or hydrogen bonding capability. In this fashion, discrete and ordered&#160;metallo&#8208;sequences are formed as thermodynamic products in a single step, and these then fold into defined conformations due to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between electron rich and poor aromatic regions of the combined componentry.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Formation of Polymer Janus Discs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward method is presented for the preparation of nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs with controlled shape, size, and aspect ratio. The method relies on cross&#8208;linkable ABC triblock terpolymers and involves first the preparation of prolate ellipsoidal microparticles by combining Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane emulsification with evaporation&#8208;induced confinement assembly (EICA). By varying the pore diameter of the SPG membrane, we produce Janus discs with controlled size distributions centered around hundreds of nanometers to several microns. We further transferred the discs to water  via  mild sulfonation of PS to polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) and verified the Janus character by subsequent labelling with cationic nanoparticles. Finally, we show that the sulfonated Janus discs are amphiphilic and can be used as efficient colloidal stabilizers for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) emulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Ligand Exchange in Atomically Dispersed Catalysts for Modulating the Activity and Selectivity of Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational control of the coordination environment of atomically dispersed catalysts is pivotal to achieve desirable catalytic reactivity. We report the reversible control of coordination structure in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via ligand exchange reactions to reversibly modulate their reactivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CO&#8208;ligated atomically dispersed Rh catalyst exhibited ~30&#8208;fold higher ORR activity than the NH  x  &#8208;ligated catalyst, whereas the latter showed three times higher H  2  O  2  selectivity than the former. Post&#8208;treatments of the catalysts with CO or NH  3  allowed the reversible exchange of CO and NH  x  ligands, which reversibly tuned oxidation state of metal centers and their ORR activity and selectivity. DFT calculations revealed that more reduced oxidation state of CO&#8208;ligated Rh site could further stabilize the *OOH intermediate, facilitating the two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron pathway ORR. The reversible ligand exchange reactions were generalized to Ir&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Bioimaging through Signal Amplification by Combining Indicator Displacement Assay with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent chemosensors are powerful imaging tools in the fields of life sciences and engineering. Based on the principle of supramolecular chemistry, indicator displacement assay (IDA) provides an alternative approach for constructing and optimizing chemosensors, which has the advantages of simplicity, tunability, and modularity. However, the application of IDA in bioimaging continues to face a series of challenges, including interfering signals, background noise, and inconsistent spatial location. Accordingly, we herein report a supramolecular bioimaging strategy of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;assisted IDA by employing macrocyclic amphiphiles as the operating platform. By merging FRET with IDA, the limitations of IDA in bioimaging were addressed. As a proof of concept, the study achieved mitochondria&#8208;targeted imaging of adenosine triphosphate in live cells with signal amplification. This study opens a non&#8208;covalent avenue for bioimaging with advancements in tunability, generality, and simplicity, apart from the covalent approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hydroxylation and Alkoxylation of Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S  N  Ar) is a powerful strategy for incorporating a heteroatom into an aromatic ring by displacement of a leaving group with a nucleophile. However, this method is generally limited to electron&#8208;deficient arenes. We have now established a reliable method for accessing phenols, as well as phenyl alkyl ethers via catalytic S  N  Ar reactions. Specifically, by using a rhodium catalyst in the absence of a base, we achieved both hydroxylation and alkoxylation of aryl fluorides, which are inert under classical S  N  Ar conditions. The method was applicable to a broad array of electron&#8208;rich and neutral aryl fluorides, which were activated via &#951;  6  &#8208;coordination with a cyclopentadienyl rhodium species. Although the mechanism of S  N  Ar reactions involving metal arene complexes is hypothesized to involve a stepwise pathway (addition followed by elimination), experimental data that support this hypothesis is still under exploration. We performed mechanistic studies and carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggested either a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile. Importantly, we isolated a rhodium &#951;  5  &#8208;cyclohexadienyl complex intermediate with an sp  3  &#8208;hybridized carbon bearing both the nucleophile and the leaving group.</dc:description>

         <title>How aromatic are molecular nanorings? The case of a six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring&#8224;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large conjugated rings with persistent currents are novel promising structures in molecular&#8208;scale electronics. A six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring structure that allegedly sustained an aromatic ring current involving 78&#960; electrons was recently synthesize. In this paper, we provide compelling evidence that this molecule is not aromatic, contrary to what was inferred from the analysis of 1H&#8208;NMR data and computational calculations that suffer from large delocalization errors. The main reason behind the absence of an aromatic ring current in these nanorings is the low delocalization in the transition from the porphyrins to the bridging butadiyne linkers, which disrupts the overall conjugated circuit. These results highlight the importance of choosing a suitable computational method to study large conjugated molecules and the appropriate aromaticity descriptors to identify the part of the molecule responsible for the loss of aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Diazomethyl Radicals by Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Their Cycloaddition with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the generation of diazomethyl radicals and their addition to alkenes is described. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the diazo carbon. This umpolung strategy overcomes the limitations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds with alkenes.







Abstract
A general catalytic methodology for the synthesis of pyrazolines from &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds and conjugated alkenes is reported. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds promoted by the tert&#8208;butylperoxy radical generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the carbon atom attached with the diazo group. The regiocontrolled addition of diazomethyl radicals to carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds followed by intramolecular ring closure on the terminal diazo nitrogen and tautomerization affords a diverse set of pyrazolines in good yields with excellent regioselectivity. This strategy overcomes the limitations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds with alkenes. Furthermore, the straightforward formation of the diazomethyl radicals provides umpolung reactivity, thus opening new opportunities for the versatile transformations of diazo compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbene Catalysis for the Synthesis of Aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a single&#8208;electron approach for the construction of aliphatic ketones from activated carboxylic acids using merged NHC/photoredox catalysis. Computational studies and mechanistic analysis revealed that reactivity is dependent on both the substrate and NHC catalyst. This methodology was showcased in the direct functionalization of amino acids and bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has gained attention recently for the synthesis of C&#8722;C bonds. Guided by density functional theory and mechanistic analyses, we report the light&#8208;driven synthesis of aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones using single&#8208;electron NHC operators. Computational and experimental results reveal that the reactivity of the key radical intermediate is substrate&#8208;dependent and can be modulated through steric and electronic parameters of the NHC. Catalyst potential is harnessed in the visible&#8208;light driven generation of an acyl azolium radical species that undergoes selective coupling with various radical partners to afford diverse ketone products. This methodology is showcased in the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino acids and pharmaceutical compounds, highlighting the utility of single&#8208;electron NHC operators.

         <title>Strained and Reactive Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Supported Metallasilanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new stable donor/acceptor&#8208;supported MnI&#8208;metallasilanone was synthesized. This silanone complex is highly strained because of its incorporation in a small cyclic structure formed by the intramolecular silanone&#8208;MnI interaction. Thanks to the high ring strain, the interaction Si=O&#8594;Mn is labile, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity with various small molecules such as H2 or ethylene gas in mild conditions.







Abstract
A novel stable donor/acceptor&#8208;supported MnI&#8208;metallasilanone 3 was synthesized. The intramolecular silanone&#8208;MnI interaction induces a highly strained three&#8208;membered cyclic structure, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity of 3 as a donor/acceptor complex of silanone. Indeed, metallasilanone 3 readily reacts with various small molecules such as H2 or ethylene gas in mild conditions.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Linkers for Protein Chemical Synthesis through Solid&#8208;Phase Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic approach was developed for the synthesis of proteins by solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation based on a tailor&#8208;made phosphatase&#8208;cleavable linker (see scheme). The size of the enzyme used directly correlates with the efficiency of the release of the synthesized protein. The method was applied to the synthesis of a 15&#8197;kDa polypeptide, the longest sequence ever synthesized through solid&#8208;phase native chemical ligation.







Abstract
The total synthesis of long proteins requires the assembly of multiple fragments through successive ligations. The need for intermediate purification steps is a strong limitation, particularly in terms of overall yield. One solution to this problem would be solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation (SPCL), for which a first peptide segment must be immobilized on a SPCL&#8208;compatible solid support through a linker that can be cleaved under very mild conditions to release the assembled protein. The cleavage of SPCL linkers has previously required chemical conditions sometimes incompatible with sensitive protein targets. Herein, we describe an alternative enzymatic approach to trigger cleavage under extremely mild and selective conditions. Optimization of the linker structure and use of a small enzyme able to diffuse into the solid support were key to the success of the strategy. We demonstrated its utility by the assembly of three peptide segments on the basis of native chemical ligation to afford a 15&#8197;kDa polypeptide.

         <title>Sydnone Methides&#8212;A Forgotten Class of Mesoionic Compounds for the Generation of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Except for a single example, sydnone methides have been unknown to date. Syntheses are described here, leading to 10 stable and intensely colorful, slightly fluorescent sydnone methides with Z=CN, COOMe, and SO2Me, respectively. On deprotonation, unique anionic &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are formed which react to thioethers and selenoethers, mercury, gold and rhodium complexes, and 4&#8208;acylsydnone methide on treatment with acyl chlorides.







Abstract
Sydnone methides are described from which only one single example has been mentioned in the literature so far. Their deprotonation gave anions which can be formulated as &#960;&#8208;electron rich anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Sulfur and selenium adducts were stabilized as their methyl ethers, and mercury, gold as well as rhodium complexes of the sydnone methide carbenes were prepared. Sydnone methide anions also undergo C&#8722;C coupling reactions with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;iodobenzene under Pd(PPh3)4 and CuBr catalysis. 77Se&#8197;NMR resonance frequencies and 1JC4&#8208;Se as well as 1JC4&#8208;H coupling constants have been determined to gain knowledge about the electronic properties of the anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. The carbene carbon atom of the sydnone methide anion 3&#8201;j resonates at &#948;=155.2&#8197;ppm in 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C which is extremely shifted upfield in comparison to classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers with Dual Active Sites for Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of water dissociation active sites in conjugated acetylenic polymers leads to highly efficient dual active site photocathodes. In poly&#8208; (diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) on Cu foam, the photoactivated C&#946;(H) split the water molecule, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; are responsible for the hydrogen evolution, reaching a benchmark photocurrent density of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE at pH&#8197;13.







Abstract
Although being attractive materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER) under neutral or acidic conditions, conjugated polymers still show poor PEC HER performance in alkaline medium due to the lack of water dissociation sites. Herein, we demonstrate that tailoring the polymer skeleton from poly(diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET) to poly(2,6&#8208;diethynylbenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (pBDT) and poly(diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) (pDTT) in conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) introduces highly efficient active sites for water dissociation. As a result, pDTT and pBDT, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 120&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE; pH&#8197;13), which are 4.2 and 3&#8197;times higher than that of pDET, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron&#8208;enriched C&#946; of the outer thiophene rings of pDTT are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.

As a result, &lt;b&gt;pDTT&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;pBDT&lt;/b&gt;, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 120&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE; pH&#8197;13), which are 4.2 and 3&#8197;times higher than that of &lt;b&gt;pDET&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron-enriched C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt; of the outer thiophene rings of &lt;b&gt;pDTT&lt;/b&gt; are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskitoid with Zwitterion Cysteamine Linker and its Crystal&#8211;Crystal Transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique organic&#8211;inorganic single&#8208;crystal perovskitoid structure (yellow) is synthesized by using zwitterionic cysteamine linkers. It gradually transforms into a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper structure (red crystallites) via a crystal&#8211;crystal transformation. The perovskitoid can be used as an active layer in self&#8208;powered photodetector and as a selective Ni2+ ion detection probe.







Abstract
We demonstrate synthesis of a new low&#8208;D hybrid perovskitoid (a perovskite&#8208;like hybrid halide structure, yellow crystals, P21/n space group) using zwitterion cysteamine (2&#8208;aminoethanethiol) linker, and its remarkable molecular diffusion&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase (Red crystals, Pnma space group). Our stable intermediate perovskitoid distinctly differs from all previous reports by way of a unique staggered arrangement of holes in the puckered 2D configuration with a face&#8208;sharing connection between the corrugated&#8208;1D double chains. The PL intensity for the yellow phase is 5 orders higher as compared to the red phase and the corresponding average lifetime is also fairly long (143&#8197;ns). First principles DFT calculations conform very well with the experimental band gap data. We demonstrate applicability of the new perovskitoid yellow phase as an excellent active layer in a self&#8208;powered photodetector and for selective detection of Ni2+ via On&#8208;Off&#8208;On photoluminescence (PL) based on its composite with few&#8208;layer black phosphorous.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer Synthesis by Merging Photoiniferter and Organocatalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;b&#8208;polyether block copolymers are achieved in one step by combining photoiniferter polymerization of acrylamides with organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of epoxides. The two polymerization systems are compatible with one another, generating copolymers with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality and endowing selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP.







Abstract
Access to block copolymers from monomers that do not polymerize via a common mechanism requires initiation from a multifunctional species that allows orthogonal polymerization chemistries. We disclose a strategy to provide well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;b&#8208;polyether block copolymers by a one&#8208;pot combination of photoiniferter polymerization and organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using a hydroxy&#8208;functionalized trithiocarbonate photoiniferter as the dual initiator at ambient temperature. Our results reveal good compatibility between the two polymerization systems and highlight that they can be performed in arbitrary order or simultaneously with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality. We also demonstrate selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP. We harnessed the efficiency of combining these polymerization systems to provide tailor&#8208;made block copolymers from chemically distinct monomers.

         <title>Chiral Arylated Amines via C&#8208;N Coupling of Chiral Amines with Aryl Bromides Promoted by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8208;N coupling reaction has found widespread applications in organic synthesis. Over the past two decades or so, many improved catalysts have been introduced, allowing various amines and aryl electrophiles to be readily used nowadays. However, there lacks a protocol that could be used to couple a wide range of chiral amines and aryl halides, without erosion of the enantiomeric excess (ee). Reported in this article is a method based on molecular Ni catalysis driven by light, which enables stereoretentive C&#8208;N coupling of optically active amines, amino alcohols, and amino acid esters with aryl bromides, with no need for any external photosensitizer. The method is effective for a wide variety of coupling partners, including those bearing functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles, thus providing a viable alternative to accessing synthetically important chiral  N  &#8208;aryl amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids esters. Its viability is demonstrated by 92 examples with up to 99% ee.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSI, FSO  2  &#8208;NCO) is established as a uniquely reliable bis&#8208;electrophilic linker for stepwise attachment of an alcohol bearing module to an amine bearing module and thence a new module RO&#8208;C(=O)&#8208;NH&#8208;SO  2  &#8208;NR&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217; is created. The FSI&#8217;s isocyanate motif fuses directly and quickly with alcohols and phenols, affording fluorosulfuryl carbamates in nearly quantitative yield. A new reagent and process to deliver  the  FSI&#8208;derived fluorosulfuryl carbamate fragment to amines are also developed. The resulting S  VI  &#8208;F motifs from step&#8208;1 are remarkably stable, given the great structural complexities in the diverse products. In the step&#8208;2 reaction with amines, the best yield of the S&#8208;N linked products arise with water alone. This &#8220;on water&#8221; interfacial reactivity phenomenon is crucial here and also in the SOF  4  derived sulfamide ligations, revealing the latent reactivity of S  VI  &#8208;F probe for potential covalent capture of proteins in vivo which is important in today&#8217;s drug discovery. The scope of the SuFEx chemistry is largely expanded thereby and the facile entry to these phosphate&#8208;like connections should prove useful to click chemistry across diverse fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations of the alignment process of homopolyglutamate&#8208;based LLC phases: Deuterium NMR analysis of PBPMLG reveals a 90&#176; flip of the polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of anisotropic parameters in NMR&#8208;spectroscopy enables the acquisition of spatial and angular information, complementary to those from conventional isotropic NMR&#8208;measurements. The use of alignment media is a well&#8208;established method for inducing anisotropy. PBPMLG is a recently discovered polyglutamate&#8208;based alignment medium, exhibiting thermoresponsive behavior in the LLC phase, thus offering potential for deeper understanding of the alignment process. We present one approach for investigating the thermoresponsive behavior by synthesizing specifically deuterated PBPMLG&#8208;isotopologues and their subsequent analyses using  2  H NMR&#8208;spectroscopy. It was possible to relate the observed thermoresponsive behavior to a flip of the polymer with respect to the external magnetic field &#8211; an effect never observed before in glutamate&#8208;based polymeric alignment media. Furthermore, a solvent&#8208;induced temperature dependent gelation was verified in THF, which might provide yet another opportunity to manipulate the properties of this alignment medium in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrinic MOF Film for Multifaceted Electrochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical sensors are indispensable in clinical diagnosis, biochemical detection and environmental monitoring, thanks to their ability to detect analytes in real&#8208;time with direct electronic readout. However, electrochemical sensors are challenged by sensitivity &#8208; the need to detect low concentrations, and selectivity &#8208; to detect specific analytes in multicomponent systems. Herein, a porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic framework (PP&#8208;MOF), Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222 is deposited on a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) surface. It affords Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO, a versatile voltammetric sensor able to detect redox&#8208;active analytes such as inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, including nitroaromatics, phenolic and quinone&#8208;hydroquinone toxins, heavy metal ions, biological species, as well as azo dyes. As a working electrode, the high surface area of Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO enables high currents, and therefore leverages highly sensitive analysis. The metalloporphyrin centre facilitates analyte&#8208;specific redox catalysis to simultaneously detect more than one analyte in binary and ternary systems allowing for detection of a wide array of trace pollutants under real&#8208;world conditions, most with high sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular electrostatic potential and noncovalent interactions in derivatives of group 8 elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>this communication reports experimental and theoretical evidences of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group 8 elements. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N&#8208;oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques and rationalized as &#963;&#8208;hole interactions using DFT calculations and several other computational tools. We propose the term &#8220;osme bond&#8221; (OmB, Om=Os, Ru, Fe) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group 8 elements have the role of the electrophile. The word osme is the transcription of &#8000;&#963;&#956;&#942;, the ancient Greek word for smell that was used to name the heaviest group 8 element in relation to the smoky odor of its tetroxide.</dc:description>

         <title>An Improved Turn Structure for Inducing &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Formation in Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although &#946;&#8208;hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is still no universal tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that &#948;&#8208;linked &#947;(  R  )&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (  &#948;  MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides. We have developed a synthesis of protected  &#948;  MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with  l  &#8208;leucine and affords gram quantities of the  N  &#945;  &#8208;Boc&#8208;  N  &#948;  &#8208;Fmoc&#8208;&#947;(  R  )&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine building block. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms that the  &#948;  MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide. CD and NMR spectroscopic experiments allow comparison of the  &#948;  MeOrn turn template to the &#948;&#8208;linked ornithine (  &#948;  Orn) turn template that our laboratory has previously introduced and also to the popular  d  &#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly turn template. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the folding of the  &#948;  MeOrn turn template is substantially better than that of  &#948;  Orn and is comparable to  d  &#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Versatile Coatings Engineered via Simultaneous Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial modular assembly has emerged as an adaptable strategy for engineering the surface properties of substrates in biomedicine, photonics, and catalysis. Herein, we report a versatile and robust coating (pBDT&#8211;TA), self&#8208;assembled from tannic acid (TA) and a self&#8208;polymerizing aromatic dithiol (i.e., benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol, BDT), that can be engineered on diverse substrates with a precisely tuned thickness (5&#8211;40 nm) by varying the concentration of BDT used. The pBDT&#8211;TA coating is stabilized by covalent (disulfide) bonds and supramolecular (&#960;&#8211;&#960;) interactions, endowing the coating with high stability in various harsh aqueous environments across ionic strength, pH, temperature (e.g., 100 mM NaCl, HCl (pH 1) or NaOH (pH&#160;13), and water at 100 &#176;C), as well as surfactant solution (e.g., 100 mM Triton X&#8208;100) and biological buffer (e.g., Dulbecco&#8217;s phosphate&#8208;buffered saline), as validated by experiments and simulations. Moreover, the reported pBDT&#8211;TA coating enables secondary reactions on the coating for engineering hybrid adlayers (e.g., ZIF&#8208;8 shells) via phenolic&#8208;mediated adhesion, and the facile integration of aromatic fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine B) via &#960; interactions without requiring elaborate synthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Volume Change of P2&#8208;type Layered Oxide Cathode with Controlled Phase Transition by Regulating Distribution of Na+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most P2&#8208;type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further lead to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na  2/3  Mn  x  Ni  x&#8208;1/3  Co  4/3&#8208;2x  O  2  (1/3 &#8804; x &#8804; 2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2&#8208;Na  2/3  Mn  1/2  Ni  1/6  Co  1/3  O  2  cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5&#8208;4.5 V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9%. Such a low strain is benefical for cycling stability. The current work provides a new and effective route to regulate the structural evolution of the promising P2&#8208;type layered cathode for sodium ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Charge Separation Prompted Intervalence Charge Transfer in a Bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole Bridged Donor&#8208;TCBD Push&#8208;Pull System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), a phenomenon observed in molecular systems comprised of two redox centers differing in oxidation states by one unit, is reported in a novel, newly synthesized, multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (PTZ&#8208;TCBD) entities on the opposite sides.&#160; One&#8208;electron reduction of TCBD promoted electron exchange between the two TCBD resulting in IVCT transition in the near&#8208;infrared region.&#160;   The stabilization energy, &#8208;   D   G  com  and comproportionation equilibrium constant, K  com  calculated from peak potentials of the split reduction waves were found to be 1.06 x 10  4  J/mol, and 72.3 M  &#8208;1  , respectively.&#160; Further, the IVCT transition was also witnessed during the process of thermodynamically feasible electron transfer upon excitation of the TDPP entity in the system, and served as a diagnostic marker to characterize the electron transfer product. Subsequent transient absorption spectral studies and data analysis by Global and Target analyses revealed occurrence of ultrafast charge separation (k  cs  ~ 10  10  s  &#8208;1  ) owing to the close proximity and good communication between the entities of the multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system.&#160; The role of central TDPP in promoting IVCT is borne out from the present investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Radical Hydro&#8208; and Aminooxygenation of Unactivated Alkenes Tuned by Ketoxime Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported here is a tunable photocatalytic protocol for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated alkenes by using readily accessible ketoxime carbonates as the diverse functionalization reagents. Mechanism studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy transfer promoted N&#8208;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates leading to alkoxylcarbonyloxyl and iminyl radicals under visible light photocatalysis, followed by the addition of alkoxylcarbonyloxyl radical to alkenes. By taking advantage of the different stability of iminyl radicals, the generated carbon radical either abstracts a hydrogen atom from the media to form the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrooxygenation product or trapped by the persistent iminyl radical to furnish the aminooxygenation product. Notably, this is the first example of direct hydrooxygenation of unactivated olefins with anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity involving an oxygen&#8208;centred radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular assembly of conjugated polymers under vibrational strong coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong coupling plays a significant role in influencing chemical reactions and tuning material properties by modifying the energy landscapes of the systems. Here we study the effect of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on supramolecular organization. For this purpose, a rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymer known to form gels was strongly coupled together with its solvent in a microfluidic IR Fabry&#8208;Perot cavity. Absorption and fluorescence studies indicate a large modification of the self&#8208;assembly under such cooperative VSC. Electron microscopy confirms that in this case, the supramolecular morphology is totally different from that observed in the absence of strong coupling. In addition, the self&#8208;assembly kinetics are altered and depend on the solvent vibration under VSC. The results are compared to kinetic isotope effects on the self&#8208;assembly to help clarify the role of different parameters under strong coupling. These findings indicate that VSC is a valuable new tool for controlling supramolecular assemblies with broad implications for the molecular and material sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Unambiguous Tracking of Protein Phosphorylation by Fast High&#8208;Resolution FOSY NMR**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new suite of 2D FOSY experiments focuses on one coupled nuclear spin system at a time, that is, a PTM site or a structural hotspot in general, with 3&#8211;5 known frequencies. With higher sensitivity and versatility than achievable by traditional experiments, FOSY solves the spectral dispersion problem and obtains only the relevant local NMR signal assignment in a few hours, as demonstrated for two phosphorylation sites in the 441&#8208;residue IDP Tau.







Abstract
Dysregulation of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation is often involved in disease. NMR may elucidate exact loci and time courses of PTMs at atomic resolution and near&#8208;physiological conditions but requires signal assignment to individual atoms. Conventional NMR methods for this base on tedious global signal assignment that may often fail, as for large intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We present a sensitive, robust alternative to rapidly obtain only the local assignment near affected signals, based on FOcused SpectroscopY (FOSY) experiments using selective polarisation transfer (SPT). We prove its efficiency by identifying two phosphorylation sites of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#946;) in human Tau40, an IDP of 441 residues, where the extreme spectral dispersion in FOSY revealed unprimed phosphorylation also of Ser409. FOSY may broadly benefit NMR studies of PTMs and other hotspots in IDPs, including sites involved in molecular interactions.

         <title>Epitaxial Nickel Ferrocyanide Stabilizes Jahn&#8211;Teller Distortions of Manganese Ferrocyanide for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;based Prussian Blue analogue prone to destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions upon oxidation is coated with an epitaxial layer of Ni&#8208;based Prussian Blue. This outer layer exerts an anisotropic strain on the lattice of the inner layer, largely preventing structural degradation during Na+ extraction and re&#8208;insertion. As a sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode, the material combines the high capacity and high stability of its two components.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based Prussian Blue, Na2&#8722;&#948;Mn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is a good candidate for sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. Herein, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel&#8208;based Prussian Blue (Na2&#8722;&#948;Ni[Fe(CN)6]). The one&#8208;pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core&#8211;shell materials, which usually needs several steps. The material has an electrochemical capacity of 93&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, of which it retains 96&#8201;% after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles (vs. 37&#8201;% for MnPB). Its rate capability is also remarkable: at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (ca. 55&#8197;C) it can reversibly store 70&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ca. 10&#8722;8&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1. The epitaxial outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, preventing the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de&#8208;sodiation.

         <title>Heteroleptic Ligation by an endo&#8208;Functionalized Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage compound is synthesized that is endo&#8208;functionalized with one carboxylic acid and two imidazole moieties. These groups can cooperate with each other to coordinate to Zn(II) and Fe(II) resulting in biomimetic quasi&#8208;heteroleptic transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cage complexes. Coordination of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate to the iron complex leads to an increase of its reactivity towards dioxygen.







Abstract
A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;heteroleptic complexes with properly endo&#8208;functionalized cages as ligands is presented. The cage ligand reported here is of a covalent organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine.

&lt;p&gt;A cage compound is synthesized that is &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-functionalized with one carboxylic acid and two imidazole moieties. These groups can cooperate with each other to coordinate to Zn(II) and Fe(II) resulting in biomimetic quasi-heteroleptic transition-metal-cage complexes. Coordination of &#945;-ketoglutarate to the iron complex leads to an increase of its reactivity towards dioxygen.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasi-heteroleptic complexes with properly endo-functionalized cages as ligands is presented. The cage ligand reported here is of a covalent organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine. Inspired by enzymatic active sites, the described system bears one carboxylate and two imidazole moieties as independent ligating units through which it is able to coordinate to transition metals. Analysis of the iron(II) complex in solution and the solid state validates the structure and shows that no undesired but commonly observed dimerization process takes place. The solid-state structure shows a five-coordinate metal center with the carboxylate bidentately bound to iron, which makes &lt;b&gt;Fe@2&lt;/b&gt; an unprecedentedly detailed structural model complex for this kind of non-heme iron oxygenases. As, as confirmed by the crystal structure, sufficient space for other organic ligands is available, the biologically relevant ligand &#945;-ketoglutarate is implemented. We observe biomimetic reaction behavior towards dioxygen that opens studies investigating &lt;b&gt;Fe@2&lt;/b&gt; as a functional model complex.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Remote Site&#8208;Selective Radical C(sp3)&#8722;H Monodeuteration of Amides using D2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Radical C&#8722;H Deuteration: A environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for remote radical C&#8722;H deuteration at various unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds including primary C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms for the &#948;&#8208;deuteration of primary amines, &#947;&#8208;deuteration of aliphatic acids and &#945;&#8208;deuteration of secondary amines has been developed.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into biologically active compounds is of high interest in pharmaceutical industry. We present a mild and environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for the remote selective radical C&#8722;H monodeuteration of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in various amides with inexpensive heavy water (D2O) as the deuterium source. The method uses the easily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonyl moiety as an N&#8208;radical precursor that generates the remote C&#8208;radical via site&#8208;selective 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Methyl thioglycolate, that readily exchanges its proton with D2O, serves as the radical deuteration reagent and as a chain&#8208;carrier. The highly site&#8208;selective monodeuteration has been applied to different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds and also to the deuteration of C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms. The potential utility of this method is further demonstrated by the site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into natural product derivatives and drugs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Loaded Hollow Carbon Spheres as Nanoreactors for Hydrogenation of Levulinic Acid: Explicitly Recognizing the Void&#8208;Confinement Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The void&#8208;confinement effect of metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon spheres as synthetic nanoreactors is explicitly recognized as an integrating effect involving electronic metal&#8211;support interactions, reactant enrichment, and diffusion. These findings provide insights for comprehending microenvironment effects of hollow carbon nanostructures in biomass hydrogenation applications.







Abstract
As a typical class of man&#8208;made nanoreactors, metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon nanostructures (MHC nanoreactors) exhibit competitive potentials in the heterogeneous catalysis due to their tailorable microenvironment effects, in which the void&#8208;confinement effect is one of the most fundamental functions in boosting the catalytic performance. Herein this paper, Ru&#8208;loaded hollow carbon spheres are employed as nanoreactors with a crucial biomass hydrogenation process, levulinic acid (LA) hydrogenation into &#947;&#8208;valerolactone, as the probe reaction to further recognize the forming mechanism of this pivotal effect. We demonstrated that the void&#8208;confinement effect of the selected MHC nanoreactors is essentially driven by an integrating action of electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, reactant enrichment and diffusion, which are mainly ascribed to peculiar properties of hollow nanoreactors both in electronic and structural aspects, respectively. This work offers a distinct case for interpreting the catalytic behaviour of MHC nanoreactors, which could potentially promise broader insights into the microenvironment engineering strategies of hollow nanostructures.

         <title>Double Ionic&#8211;Electronic Transfer Interface Layers for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers between electrode and electrolyte were created by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene inside the solid&#8208;state lithium battery, resulting in low interface resistance and highly stable interface contact.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries is impeded by the physical limitations of the interface between the electrode and solid electrolyte; specifically, high resistance and poor stability, as well as poor compatibility with Li+ migration. We report double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers grown at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in polyethylene oxide (PEO) electrolyte. For all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4&#8741;PT&#8208;PEO&#8208;PT&#8741;Li cells, the formation of a conductive polythiophene (PT) layer at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface resulted in an at least sevenfold decrease in interface resistance, and realized a capacity retention of about 94&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles along with a lower polarization voltage under a rate of 2&#8197;C. The mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductive layers imparted superior interface stability and contact while keeping good compatibility with the Li anode.

         <title>Selective 13C&#8208;Labels on Repeating Glycan Oligomers to Reveal Protein Binding Epitopes through NMR: Polylactosamine Binding to Galectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Repeating carbohydrate patterns are commonly found in Nature in extended oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. When recognized by protein receptors, dissecting the contribution of each repeating unit to the binding event is not easy. Here, the introduction of 13C&#8208;labels at specific positions of a tri&#8208;LacNAc repeating hexasaccharide has been used in STD&#8208;HSQC&#8197;NMR experiments to reveal the preferred binding epitopes for a panel of human galectins.







Abstract
A combined chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis/NMR&#8208;based methodology is presented to identify, in unambiguous manner, the distinctive binding epitope within repeating sugar oligomers when binding to protein receptors. The concept is based on the incorporation of 13C&#8208;labels at specific monosaccharide units, selected within a repeating glycan oligomeric structure. No new chemical tags are added, and thus the chemical entity remains the same, while the presence of the 13C&#8208;labeled monosaccharide breaks the NMR chemical shift degeneracy that occurs in the non&#8208;labeled compound and allows the unique identification of the different components of the oligomer. The approach is demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study dealing with the interaction of a polylactosamine hexasaccharide with five different galectins that display distinct preferences for these entities.

         <title>Dinuclear Silver Complexes in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of silver catalysis has seen tremendous growth over the past two decades, and dinuclear complexes are often proposed to facilitate silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations. In this Minireview, we survey and analyze the various roles of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis. We also highlight outstanding questions as well as areas for potential growth and development.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of synthetically useful transformations catalyzed by silver. Across the range of silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions that have been reported, dinuclear species often emerge as a common feature, either as the (pre&#8208;)catalysts themselves or as intermediates during catalysis. This Minireview explores the role of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis, which we hope will aid in the development of improved design principles for silver catalysts.

In this Minireview, we survey and analyze the various roles of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis. We also highlight outstanding questions as well as areas for potential growth and development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of synthetically useful transformations catalyzed by silver. Across the range of silver-catalyzed reactions that have been reported, dinuclear species often emerge as a common feature, either as the (pre-)catalysts themselves or as intermediates during catalysis. This Minireview explores the role of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis, which we hope will aid in the development of improved design principles for silver catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dissecting the Flash Chemistry of Electrogenerated Reactive Intermediates by Microdroplet Fusion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microreactor on the fly: A special microreactor that permits mass spectrometric probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was demonstrated based on collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets, which employed a theta&#8208;glass capillary integrated with carbon bipolar electrodes to produce short&#8208;lived intermediates in situ.







Abstract
A novel mass spectrometric method for probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was developed based on rapid collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets by using a theta&#8208;glass capillary. The two individual microchannels of the theta&#8208;glass capillary are asymmetrically or symmetrically fabricated with a carbon bipolar electrode to produce intermediates in situ. Microdroplets containing the newly formed intermediates collide with those of the invoked reactants at sub&#8208;10 microsecond level, making it a powerful tool for exploring their ultrafast initial transformations. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the identification of the key radical cation intermediate in the oxidative dimerization of 8&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and also the first disclosure of previously hidden nitrenium ion involved reaction pathway in the C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling between N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylaniline and phenothiazine.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Biomimetic Aldol Reaction of Glycinates and Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient biomimetic aldol reaction of glycinate and trifluoromethyl ketones was developed with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields with excellent distereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee) without protection of the active NH2 group. The reaction proceeds via a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis pathway similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinates represents an intriguing and straightforward strategy to make biologically significant chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid derivatives. But it is not easy to realize the transformation due to the disruption of the reactive NH2 group of glycinates. Inspired by the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine, we successfully developed an asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinate 5 and trifluoromethyl ketones 4 with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral N&#8208;methyl pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing chiral &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields (for the syn&#8208;diastereomers) with up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee under very mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine. Pyridoxal catalyst 7&#8201;a activates both reactants at the same time and brings them together in a specific spatial orientation, accounting for the high efficiency as well as excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>A Primary Acyl Phosphine Stabilized by a Phosphonium Ylide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 and subsequent reactions are used to access Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 and Ph3PCHC(O)PH2. The zwitterionic nature of these species illustrates this new strategy to stabilization of acylphosphines. Indeed the latter species is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines, devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.







Abstract
Primary acyl&#8208;phosphines are scarce in the literature. Here we show that the reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 proceeds to give the species Ph3PCHC(O)PH(GePh3) 1. Deprotonation of 1 with Na[N(SiMe3)2] generates the salt [Na(THF)2][Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)] 2 which provides subsequent access to the bis&#8208;germanylated acylphosphine, Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 3. Alternatively, treatment of 1 with HCl in dioxane affords the primary acylphosphine Ph3PCHC(O)PH2 4. Compound 4 is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines and the first devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.

         <title>Alkene Isomerization Revitalizes the Coates&#8211;Claisen Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic use of alkene isomerization has enabled the first systematic study of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first discovered by Coates nearly forty years ago and rarely applied since. We explore the mediation of this rearrangement by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids and demonstrate the synthetic utility of the products through a concise synthesis of the iridoid natural product isoneomatatabiol.







Abstract
The [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first investigated by Coates nearly four decades ago, is set apart from other variants of the Claisen rearrangement owing to the versatile monoprotected 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl motif featured in the products. Unfortunately, the synthetically elusive nature of the substrates has thus far precluded the widespread application of this attractive transformation. Herein, we show that the key allylic vinyl acetals can be efficiently generated through alkene isomerization of their readily available regioisomeric counterparts (derived from allylic alcohols and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes), thus enabling the first systematic study of the substrate scope of this rearrangement, as well as the discovery of exceptionally mild conditions for its mediation by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

         <title>P&#8208;block atomically dispersed antimony catalyst for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main&#8208;group (  s  &#8208; and  p  &#8208;block) metals are generally regarded as catalytically inactive due to the delocalized  s  /  p  &#8208;band. Herein, we successfully synthesized a  p  &#8208;block antimony single&#8208;atom catalyst (Sb SAC) with the Sb&#8208;N  4  configuration for efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resulting Sb SAC exhibits superior ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86 V and excellent stability, which outperforms many transition&#8208;metal (TM,  d  &#8208;block) based SACs and commercial Pt/C. In addition, it presents an excellent power density of 184.6 mW cm  &#8208;2  and a high specific capacity (803.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) in Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Main-group (  s  - and  p  -block) metals are generally regarded as catalytically inactive due to the delocalized  s  /  p  -band. Herein, we successfully synthesized a  p  -block antimony single-atom catalyst (Sb SAC) with the Sb-N  4  configuration for efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resulting Sb SAC exhibits superior ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V and excellent stability, which outperforms many transition-metal (TM,  d  -block) based SACs and commercial Pt/C. In addition, it presents an excellent power density of 184.6 mW cm  -2  and a high specific capacity (803.5 mAh g  -1  ) in Zn-air battery. Both experiment and theoretical calculation manifest that the active catalytic sites are positively charged Sb-N  4  single-metal sites, which have closed  d  shells. Density of states (DOS) results unveil the  p  orbital of the atomically dispersed Sb cation in Sb SAC can easily interact with O  2  -  p  orbital to form hybrid states, facilitating the charge transfer and generating appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate-determining step. This work sheds light on the atomic-level preparing  p  -block Sb metal catalyst for highly active ORR, and further provides valuable guidelines for the rational design of other main-group-metal SACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Rhodium Complexes with Chiral Diene Ligands via Diastereoselective Coordination and Their Application in the Asymmetric Insertion of Diazo Compounds into E&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium complexes with bulky racemic dienes were synthesized and separated into pure enantiomers by diastereoselective coordination with a chiral auxiliary ligand. The optimal structure of the auxiliary ligand and the selectivity of coordination were predicted by density functional theory calculations. The resulting chiral complexes catalyze the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A new method for the synthesis of chiral diene rhodium catalysts is introduced. The readily available racemic tetrafluorobenzobarrelene complexes [(R2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 were separated into two enantiomers via selective coordination of one of them with the auxiliary S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand. One of the resulting chiral complexes with an exceptionally bulky diene ligand [(R,R&#8208;iPr2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 was an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds giving the functionalized organoboranes and silanes with high yields (79&#8211;97&#8201;%) and enantiomeric purity (87&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). The stereoselectivity of separation via auxiliary ligand and that of the catalytic reaction was predicted by DFT calculations.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Computational Evaluation of Low&#160;Symmetry Pd2L4 Cages to Aid in System Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of unsymmetrical components in metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry allows for low&#8208; symmetry architectures with anisotropic cavities toward guest&#8208;binding with high specificity and affinity. Unsymmetrical ditopic ligands mixed with Pd(II) have the potential to self&#8208;assemble into reduced symmetry Pd  2  L  4  metallo&#8208;architectures. Mixtures of isomers can form, however, resulting in potentially undesirable heterogeneity within a system. Therefore it is paramount to be able to design components that preferentially form a single isomer. Previous data suggested that computational methods could predict with reasonable accuracy whether unsymmetrical ligands would preferentially self&#8208;assemble into a single isomer under constraints of geometrical mismatch. We successfully apply a collaborative computational and experimental workflow to mitigate costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error synthetic approaches. Our low&#8208;cost computational workflow rapidly constructs new unsymmetrical ligands (and Pd  2  L  4  cage isomers) and ranks their likelihood for forming  cis  &#8208;Pd  2  L  4  assemblies. From this narrowed search space, we successfully synthesised four new low&#8208;symmetry,  cis  &#8208;Pd  2  L  4  cages, with cavities of different shapes and sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;switchable cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids with napthalenediimide&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes</title>

         <dc:description>:  Two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) bis&#8208;imidazolium salts have been used as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors for the preparation of NDI&#8208;functionalized complexes of rhodium and iridium of general formula [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] (M = Rh, Ir; NDI&#8208;NHC = NDI&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand). The cyclic voltammometric studies on these complexes show two reversible reduction waves, associated to two successive one&#8208;electron reductions of the NDI core of the ligand. The comparison of the infrared spectra of the complexes [IrCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(CO)  2  ] and their related one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduced forms, reveal that each one&#8208;electron reduction produces a decrease of the average n(CO) of 9&#8208;10 cm  &#8208;1  , indicating a significant enhancement of the electronrichness of the metal. The [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] complexes were tested in the catalytic cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. While the neutral catalysts showed little activity in these reactions, the one&#8208;electron reduced forms showed greatly enhanced activities. For the cyclization of 5&#8208;hexynoic acid, the two&#8208;electron reduction of the ligand produced further enhancement of the catalytic activity, therefore showing that the catalyst can switch between three redox species with three distinct catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A universal strategy is developed to construct a cascade Z&#8208;scheme system, in which an effective energy platform is a core to direct charge transfer and separation, blocking the unexpected type&#8208;II charge transfer pathway.

The optimized cascade Z&#8208;scheme exhibits ~19&#8208;fold photoactivity improvement for CO  2  reduction to CO in the absence of cocatalysts and costly sacrificial agents under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with BVNS, which is also superior to other reported Z&#8208;scheme systems even with noble metals as mediators.

         <title>Single dynamic covalent bond tailored responsive molecular junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive molecular devices are one of the core units for molecular electronics, and dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) provide the opportunity for the fabrication of responsive molecular devices. Herein we employ a single dynamic acyl hydrazone bond to fabricate tailored molecular devices using the scanning tunneling microscopy break&#8208;junction technique (STM&#8208;BJ) and the eutectic Ga&#8208;In technique (EGaIn). We found that the single&#8208;DCB&#8208;tailored molecular devices exhibited&#160;acid&#8208;base and/or photo&#8208;thermal response with three well&#8208;defined molecular conductance states. The reversible switching has the ON/OFF ratio of ~10 between each state for single&#8208;molecule junctions and ~3 for the SAMs&#8208;based molecular junctions. Combined with the density functional theory calculations, we revealed that the multiple conductance states of these molecular junctions originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization. Our work opens the avenue towards the design of tailored single&#8208;molecule electrical devices by implanting dynamic covalent bonds in molecular architectures.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Responsive molecular devices are one of the core units for molecular electronics, and dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) provide the opportunity for the fabrication of responsive molecular devices. Herein we employ a single dynamic acyl hydrazone bond to fabricate tailored molecular devices using the scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction technique (STM-BJ) and the eutectic Ga-In technique (EGaIn). We found that the single-DCB-tailored molecular devices exhibited&#160;acid-base and/or photo-thermal response with three well-defined molecular conductance states. The reversible switching has the ON/OFF ratio of ~10 between each state for single-molecule junctions and ~3 for the SAMs-based molecular junctions. Combined with the density functional theory calculations, we revealed that the multiple conductance states of these molecular junctions originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization. Our work opens the avenue towards the design of tailored single-molecule electrical devices by implanting dynamic covalent bonds in molecular architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mass spectrometry imaging reveals in situ behaviors of multiple components in aerosol particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhalation of atmospheric particles is toxicological to human health. However, as a complex mixture, tracing the behaviors of multiple components from real aerosol particles is crucial but unachievable by the existing methods. Here, taking advantage of the intrinsic fingerprints of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in carbonaceous aerosol (CA) upon laser irradiation, we proposed a label&#8208;free mass spectrometry imaging method to visualize and quantify the deposition, translocation and component variation of CA in organs. With this method, the heterogeneous deposition, clearance and release behavior of CA in lung, that more OC was released in parenchyma and OC was cleared faster than EC, was observed. The translocation of CA to extrapulmonary organs including kidney, liver, spleen and even brain was also verified and quantified. By comparing the ratio of OC to EC, an organ&#8208;specific release behavior of OC from CA during circulation was revealed.&#160; In orthotopic lung and liver tumor, OC was found to penetrate more into tumor foci than EC. This technique provides deeper information for understanding the systemic health effects of aerosol particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding and Calibration of Charge Storage Mechanism in Cyclic Voltammetry Curves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noticeable pseudo&#8208;capacitance behaviour out of charge storage mechanism (CSM) has attracted intensive studies because it can provide both high energy density and large output power. Although cyclic voltammetry is recognized as the feasible electrochemical technique to determine it quantitatively in the previous works, the results are inferior due to uncertainty in the definitions and application conditions. Herein, three successive treatments, including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background, as well as a non&#8208;linear fitting algorithm are employed for the first time to calibrate the different CSM contribution of three typical cathode materials, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, and achieve well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance and diffusive contributions to the total capacity. This work can eliminate misunderstanding concepts and correct ambiguous results of the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution, and recognize the essence of CSM in electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discharge&#8208;Induced Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction induced by the applied potential is of great significance for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we show that a previously overlooked discharge current in the low applied potential region also leads to in situ electrochemical activation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped nickel oxyhydroxide surface. We exploit the fact that doping of heteroatoms weakens the surface structure, and hence, a weak discharge current originating from the capacitive nature of nickel oxyhydroxide has a strong structure&#8208;reforming ability to promote the formation of nitrogen and oxygen vacancies. The current density at 1.4 V (vs. Hg/HgO) can dramatically increase by as much as 31.3% after discharge in the low applied potential region. This work provides insight into in situ enhancement of the OER and suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cryo&#8208;electron Microscopy Imaging of Alzheimer's Amyloid&#8208;beta 42 Oligomer Displayed on a Functionally and Structurally Relevant Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional and structural A&#946;42&#8208;oligomer equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin, share major structural, functional, and biological properties with Alzheimer's wild&#8208;type A&#946;42 oligomers. Cryo&#8208;EM studies reveal that the &#945;HL&#8208;displayed oligomers structurally remain a well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, providing a stable mimetic antigen for the development of conformation&#8208;specific antibodies.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;) oligomers are pathogenic species of amyloid aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. Like certain protein toxins, A&#946; oligomers permeabilize cellular membranes, presumably through a pore formation mechanism. Owing to their structural and stoichiometric heterogeneity, the structure of these pores remains to be characterized. We studied a functional A&#946;42&#8208;pore equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin. Our data reveal A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers to share major structural, functional, and biological properties with wild&#8208;type A&#946;42&#8208;pores. Single&#8208;particle cryo&#8208;EM analysis of A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers (with an overall 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution) reveals the A&#946;42&#8208;pore region to be intrinsically flexible. The A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers will allow many of the features of the wild&#8208;type amyloid oligomers to be studied that cannot be otherwise, and may be a highly specific antigen for the development of immuno&#8208;base diagnostics and therapies.

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems Based on AIEgen&#8208;branched Rotaxane Dendrimers for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting system based on AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers has been successfully constructed which displayed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel platform for efficient light harvesting, the precise synthesis of a new family of AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers was successful realized from an AIEgen&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant AIE macromolecules, up to twenty&#8208;one AIEgens located at the tails of each branches, thus making them the first successful example of AIEgen&#8208;branched dendrimers. Attributed to the solvent&#8208;induced switching feature of the rotaxane branches, the integrated rotaxane dendrimers displayed interesting dynamic feature upon the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) process. Moreover, novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed based on these AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers, which revealed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction.

         <title>Dynamics of Meso&#8211;Chiral Interconversion in a Butterfly&#8208;Shape Overcrowded Alkene Rotor Tunable by Solvent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16466-16471, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;shape overcrowded alkene rotor was synthesized, and its meso&#8211;chiral diastereomeric interconversion processes were elucidated in different solvents. The interconversion has nontrivial bimodal dynamics involving two mechanisms, rim flip and double bond flip. The rotor shows a preference for meso cis&#8208;conformation in aromatic solvents and chiral trans&#8208;conformation in non&#8208;aromatic solvents.







Abstract
Elucidation of dynamics of molecular rotational motion is an essential part and challenging area of research. We demonstrate reversible diastereomeric interconversion of a molecular rotor composed of overcrowded butterfly&#8208;shape alkene (FDF). Its inherent dual rotatory motion (two rotors, one stator) with interconversion between two diastereomers, chiral trans&#8208;FDF and meso cis&#8208;FDF forms, has been examined in detail upon varying temperatures and solvents. The free energy profile of 180&#176; revolution of one rotor part has a bimodal shape with unevenly positioned maxima (transition states). FDF in aromatic solvents adopts preferentially meso cis&#8208;conformation, while in non&#8208;aromatic solvents a chiral trans&#8208;conformation is more abundant owing to the solvent interactions with peripheral hexyl chains (solvophobic effect). Moderate correlations between the trans&#8208;FDF/cis&#8208;FDF ratio and solvent parameters, such as refractive index, polarizability, and viscosity were found.

&lt;p&gt;A butterfly-shape overcrowded alkene rotor was synthesized, and its meso&#8211;chiral diastereomeric interconversion processes were elucidated in different solvents. The interconversion has nontrivial bimodal dynamics involving two mechanisms, rim flip and double bond flip. The rotor shows a preference for meso &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-conformation in aromatic solvents and chiral &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-conformation in non-aromatic solvents.

&lt;/p&gt;

(right) The correlation between OER activity and in situ conductivity at large current density (50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Inset shows the double exchange interactions between high valency transition&#8208;metal ions with different d orbital occupancies in the lattice of OER active intermediates containing metal&#8208;oxyl bond (MIV&#8722;O.).







Abstract
Motivated by in silico predictions that Co, Rh, and Ir dopants would lead to low overpotentials to improve OER activity of Ni&#8208;based hydroxides, we report here an experimental confirmation on the altered OER activities for a series of metals (Mo, W, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir) doped into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. The in situ electrical conductivity for metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH correlates well with the trend in enhanced OER activities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to rationalize the in situ conductivity of the key intermediate states of metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during OER. The simultaneous increase of OER activity with intermediate conductivity was later rationalized by their intrinsic connections to the double exchange (DE) interaction between adjacent metal ions with various d orbital occupancies, serving as an indicator for the key metal&#8208;oxo radical character, and an effective descriptor for the mechanistic evaluation and theoretical guidance in design and screening of efficient OER catalysts.

A new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams has been developed, and this approach can achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm currently. Using a kind of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin, we elucidate the hierarchal assembly structure and molecular interactions in bubble system.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams, and achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm. The bubble&#8208;assisted assembly (BAA) process is consisted of two periods, including bubble evolution and molecular assembly, which are dominated by the Laplace pressure and molecular interactions, respectively. Using TPPS (meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin), we systematically investigate the patterns and assembly behaviour in the bubble system with a series of characterizations, which show good uniformity in nanoscale resolution. Theoretical simulations reveal that TPPS's J&#8208;aggregates contribute to the ordered construction of molecular patterns. Finally, we propose an empirical rule for molecular patterning approach, that the surfactant and functional molecules should have the same type of charge in a two&#8208;component system. This approach exhibits promising feasibility to assemble molecular patterns at nanoscale resolution for micro/nano functional devices.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear&#8208;Optical van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals Beryllium Borates**

We propose a design strategy to achieve van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) materials. Berborite Be2BO5H3 with trigonal (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers and beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 with tetragonal (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers are predicted as two promising vdW DUV NLO crystal candidates, exhibiting a good DUV NLO performance balance with ultrawide optical band gaps, strong NLO effects, and sufficiently large birefringence.







Abstract
Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) materials hold great potential to extend DUV NLO applications to two dimensions, but they are rare in nature. In this study, we propose a design principle to realize vdW DUV NLO materials via structural evolution from the non&#8208;vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO3F) layers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) to the vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers in berborite Be2BO5H3 (BBH) and the vdW (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers in beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 (BEBO). Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the fundamental NLO properties of BBH and BEBO demonstrate that a balanced DUV NLO performance can be achieved in these two systems. Importantly, BBH, a layered material existing in nature, can achieve an available DUV phase&#8208;matched output with strong second harmonic generation (SHG) for 177.3/193.7&#8197;nm DUV lasers, which is almost identical to that of KBBF. Remarkably, BEBO shows an excellent DUV SHG capacity and an even shorter phase&#8208;matching wavelength than KBBF. Therefore, the newly discovered vdW BBH and BEBO, once verified by experiments, could provide an ideal platform to study DUV NLO effects in three dimensions and two dimensions.

         <title>Reversed Charge Transfer and Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover in Platinum Nanoclusters Anchored on Titanium Oxide with Rich Oxygen Vacancies Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16622-16627, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of oxygen vacancies in VO&#8208;rich Pt/TiO2 optimizes the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen intermediate adsorption on Pt clusters, and promotes the hydrogen spillover effect from Pt clusters to the TiO2 support, which boosts the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of metal clusters is closely related with the support; however, knowledge on the influence of the support on the catalytic activity is scarce. We demonstrate that Pt nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on porous TiO2 nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;rich Pt/TiO2) and deficient oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;deficient Pt/TiO2), display significantly different catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which VO&#8208;rich Pt/TiO2 shows a mass activity of 45.28&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is 16.7 and 58.8 times higher than those of VO&#8208;deficient Pt/TiO2 and commercial Pt/C, respectively. DFT calculations and in&#8197;situ Raman spectra suggest that porous TiO2 with rich oxygen vacancies can simultaneously achieve reversed charge transfer (electrons transfer from TiO2 to Pt NCs) and enhanced hydrogen spillover from Pt NCs to the TiO2 support, which leads to electron&#8208;rich Pt NCs being amenable to proton reduction of absorbed H*, as well as the acceleration of hydrogen desorption at Pt catalytic sites&#8212;both promoting the HER. Our work provides a new strategy for rational design of highly efficient HER catalysts.

We demonstrate that Pt nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on porous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-rich Pt/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and deficient oxygen vacancies (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-deficient Pt/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), display significantly different catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-rich Pt/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows a mass activity of 45.28&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is 16.7 and 58.8 times higher than those of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-deficient Pt/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and commercial Pt/C, respectively. DFT calculations and in&#8197;situ Raman spectra suggest that porous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with rich oxygen vacancies can simultaneously achieve reversed charge transfer (electrons transfer from TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Pt NCs) and enhanced hydrogen spillover from Pt NCs to the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support, which leads to electron-rich Pt NCs being amenable to proton reduction of absorbed H*, as well as the acceleration of hydrogen desorption at Pt catalytic sites&#8212;both promoting the HER. Our work provides a new strategy for rational design of highly efficient HER catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

Reconfigurable dynamic assembly/disassembly of light&#8208;activated colloidal motor swarms like the emergent behaviors of living systems through programmable modulation of a structured illumination is presented.







Abstract
We report robust control over the dynamic assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of light&#8208;activated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) colloidal motor swarms with features not possible in equilibrium systems. A photochemical reaction produces chemical gradients across the MoS2 colloidal motors to drive them to move. Under illumination of a gradient light, these colloidal motors display a positive phototactic motion. Mesoscale simulations prove that the self&#8208;diffusiophoresis induced by the locally consumed oxygen gradient across MoS2 colloidal motors dominates the phototactic process. By programming the structured illumination, the collective migration and well&#8208;defined shapes of colloidal motor swarms can be externally regulated. The successful realization of programmable swarm transformation of colloidal motors like the emergent behaviors of living systems in nature provides a direct proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for active soft materials and systems, with adaptive and interactive functions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Conformer&#8208;Induced Formation of Zirconium&#8211;Organic Framework for Methane Storage and MTO Product Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16521-16528, July 19, 2021. </description>

One topologically unprecedented zirconium&#8211;organic framework was successfully assembled by virtue of a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand via ligand&#8208;conformer&#8208;induction. The spe&#8208;MOF exhibits relatively high methane storage capacity and efficient MTO product separation performance due to its integrated features, shedding light on the development of novel zirconium&#8208;based adsorbents by the utilization of semirigid organic linkers aiming advanced applications.







Abstract
In pursuit of novel adsorbents with efficient adsorptive gas storage and separation capabilities remains highly desired and challenging. Although the documented zirconium&#8208;tricarboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have displayed a variety of topologies encompassing underlying and geometry mismatch ones, the employed organic linkers are exclusively rigid and poorly presenting one type of conformation in the resultant structures. Herein, a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand of H3TATAB was judiciously selected to isolate a zirconium&#8208;based spe&#8208;MOF after the preliminary discovery of srl&#8208;MOF. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the fully deprotonated TATAB linker in spe&#8208;MOF exhibits two distinct conformers, concomitant with popular Oh and rare S6 symmetrical Zr6 molecular building blocks, generating an unprecedented (3,3,12,12)&#8208;c nondefault topology. Specifically, the spe&#8208;MOF exhibits structurally higher complexity, hierarchical micropores, open metal sites free and rich electronegative groups on the pore surfaces, leading to relatively high methane storage capacity without considering the missing&#8208;linker defects and efficient MTO product separation performance.

         <title>Leakage&#8208;Proof Electrolyte Chemistry for a High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery</title>

The 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte is functionalized by Li+&#8208;conductive macromolecules of Li6PS5Cl&#8208;grafted poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate) with strong polar groups, which can interact readily with the aluminum&#8208;plastic packing layer through hydrogen bond to immobilize the electrolyte. And the moisture from ambient environment can catalyze a further polymerization of the macromolecules to seal the leaking points.







Abstract
Electrolyte leakage is a severe safety concern in lithium batteries. With highly volatile 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane as solvent, the leakage related hazards are more pronounced in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. To address this concern, a leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte is delicately designed through functionalizing the commercial electrolyte by Li6PS5Cl&#8208;grafted poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate), which can interact readily with the aluminum&#8208;plastic packing through hydrogen bond to immobilize the electrolyte. The moisture from ambient can also catalyze a further polymerization of the macromolecules to seal the leaking points and thereby to solve the leakage issue, endowing Li&#8208;S batteries superior safety even in an artificial cut pouch cell. With a bare S loading of 4.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the battery can deliver good endurance owing to the suppressed polysulfide shuttle by its polar groups. This work enlightens the design of leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte and makes a milestone for high performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

Combining organo&#8208;, bio&#8208;, and metal&#8208;catalyst for up to six synthetic steps allowed the one&#8208;pot production line towards (enantiopure) key building blocks for natural product synthesis as well as polymer science in gram&#8208;scale. The basis was set by an in&#8208;depth investigation of the initial steps of the sequence and investigating the central role of the organocatalyst {Org: 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)} as well as benzoic acid.







Abstract
Establishing one&#8208;pot, multi&#8208;step protocols combining different types of catalysts is one important goal for increasing efficiency in modern organic synthesis. In particular, the high potential of biocatalysts still needs to be harvested. Based on an in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of a new organocatalytic protocol employing two catalysts {1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO); benzoic acid (BzOH)}, a sequence was established providing starting materials for enzymatic refinement (ene reductase; alcohol dehydrogenase): A gram&#8208;scale access to a variety of enantiopure key building blocks for natural product syntheses was enabled utilizing up to six catalytic steps within the same reaction vessel.

         <title>Endocircular Li Carbon Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16649-16654, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endocircular Li carbon rings exhibit two types of electronic states of very different nature, the ordering of which changes with the ring size. This enables possible interesting applications by excitations from the electronic ground states to states of different nature depending on the ring size.







Abstract
By employing accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many&#8208;electron quantum&#8208;chemistry methods, we establish that monocyclic carbon rings can accommodate Li guest atoms. The low&#8208;lying electronic states of these endocircular systems are analyzed and found to include both charge&#8208;separated states where the guest Li atom appears as a cation and the ring as an anion and encircled&#8208;electron states where Li and the ring are neutral. The electron binding energies of the encircled&#8208;electron states increase drastically at their highly symmetric equilibrium geometries with increasing size of the ring, and in Li@C24, this state becomes the ground state. Li is very weakly bound vertical to the rings in the low&#8208;lying encircled&#8208;electron states, hinting to van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals binding. Applcations are mentioned.

         <title>The First High&#8208;Temperature Supramolecular Radical Ferroics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16668-16673, July 19, 2021. </description>

The first supramolecular radical ferroics show paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors, as well as high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity.







Abstract
Organic radical ferroics such as TEMPO have attracted widespread interest. However, the relatively low Curie temperature of 287&#8197;K and melting point of 311&#8197;K severely hinder its application potential. Despite extensive interest, high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics have not yet been found. Here, taking advantage of chemical design and supramolecular radical chemistry, we designed two high&#8208;temperature organic supramolecular radical ferroics [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ReO4) (1) and [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ClO4) (2), which can retain ferroelectricity up to 413&#8197;K and 450&#8197;K, respectively. To our knowledge, they are both the first supramolecular radical ferroics and unprecedented high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics, where the supramolecular component is vital for the stabilization of the radical and extending the working temperature window. Both also have paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, and excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors comparable to that of LiNbO3.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free, Base&#8208;Promoted 1,2&#8208;Additions of Polyfluorophenylboronates to Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16529-16538, July 19, 2021. </description>

Herein we report a transition metal&#8208;free procedure for the base&#8208;promoted 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluorophenylboronates to aldehydes and ketones to generate organofluorine&#8208;containing alcohols in yields up to 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel protocol for the transition metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluoroaryl boronate esters to aldehydes and ketones is reported, which provides secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, and ketones. Control experiments and DFT calculations indicate that both the ortho&#8208;F substituents on the polyfluorophenyl boronates and the counterion K+ in the carbonate base are critical. The distinguishing features of this procedure include the employment of commercially available starting materials and the broad scope of the reaction with a wide variety of carbonyl compounds giving moderate to excellent yields. Intriguing structural features involving O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonding, as well as arene&#8208;perfluoroarene interactions, in this series of racemic polyfluoroaryl carbinols have also been addressed.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions with dioxazolones are used for intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;N, N=S and N=P bond formation. The key acyl nitrene iron intermediate is formed by conversion of the ground sextet state of dioxazolone&#8208;bounding iron species to quartet spin state under visible&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions with dioxazolones for intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;N, N=S, and N=P bond formation are described. These reactions occur with exogenous&#8208;ligand&#8208;free process and feature satisfactory to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%), an ample substrate scope (109 examples) under mild reaction conditions. In contrast to intramolecular C&#8722;H amidations strategies, an intermolecular regioselective C&#8722;H amidation via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced nitrene transfer reactions is devised. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway. Computational studies show that the decarboxylation of dioxazolone depends on the conversion of ground sextet state dioxazolone&#8208;bounding iron species to quartet spin state via visible&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Discovery of a Low Thermal Conductivity Oxide Guided by Probe Structure Prediction and Machine Learning</title>

Ba10Y6Ti4O27 has a complex aperiodic structure with the lowest thermal conductivity of any first&#8208;transition&#8208;series oxide. It is metastable, which makes it challenging to identify. Experimental exploration was focused sufficiently by structure prediction and property&#8208;targeted machine learning to enable the isolation of this material (see picture), whose structural motifs provide new insight into the control of heat transport.







Abstract
We report the aperiodic titanate Ba10Y6Ti4O27 with a room&#8208;temperature thermal conductivity that equals the lowest reported for an oxide. The structure is characterised by discontinuous occupancy modulation of each of the sites and can be considered as a quasicrystal. The resulting localisation of lattice vibrations suppresses phonon transport of heat. This new lead material for low&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity oxides is metastable and located within a quaternary phase field that has been previously explored. Its isolation thus requires a precisely defined synthetic protocol. The necessary narrowing of the search space for experimental investigation was achieved by evaluation of titanate crystal chemistry, prediction of unexplored structural motifs that would favour synthetically accessible new compositions, and assessment of their properties with machine&#8208;learning models.

A multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopic platform allows measurement of structural, mechanical, and electronic transport properties of a single molecule. By simultaneous measurement and correlating electrical and optical properties of a single&#8208;molecule junction, mutually agreeable evidence of dynamic behavior of single&#8208;molecule sensitivity is extracted. Strain&#8208;induced structural changes of an isolated individual molecule in situ can thus be observed.







Abstract
Nanoscale manipulation and characterization of individual molecules is necessary to understand the intricacies of molecular structure, which governs phenomena such as reaction mechanisms, catalysis, local effective temperatures, surface interactions, and charge transport. Here we utilize Raman enhancement between two nanostructured electrodes in combination with direct charge transport measurements to allow for simultaneous characterization of the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of a single molecule. This multi&#8208;dimensional information yields repeatable, self&#8208;consistent, verification of single&#8208;molecule resolution, and allows for detailed analysis of structural and configurational changes of the molecule in situ. These experimental results are supported by a machine&#8208;learning based statistical analysis of the spectral information and calculations to provide insight into the correlation between structural changes in a single&#8208;molecule and its charge&#8208;transport properties.

         <title>Surface oxygen Vacancies on Reduced Co3O4(100): Superoxide Formation and Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>

Activated molecular oxygen (superoxide, O2&#8722;) can oxidize CO already at 120&#8197;K on B&#8208;layer terminated Co3O4(100) with oxygen vacancies. This rendered scheme illustrates how a vibrational spectrum of the adsorbed superoxide is recorded with surface action spectroscopy.







Abstract
The activation of molecular oxygen is a fundamental step in almost all catalytic oxidation reactions. We have studied this topic and the role of surface vacancies for Co3O4(100) films with a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical methods. We show that the as&#8208;prepared surface is B&#8208;layer terminated and that mild reduction produces oxygen single and double vacancies in this layer. Oxygen adsorption experiments clearly reveal different superoxide species below room temperature. The superoxide desorbs below ca. 120&#8197;K from a vacancy&#8208;free surface and is not active for CO oxidation while superoxide on a surface with oxygen vacancies is stable up to ca. 270&#8197;K and can oxidize CO already at the low temperature of 120&#8197;K. The vacancies are not refilled by oxygen from the superoxide, which makes them suitable for long&#8208;term operation. Our joint experimental/theoretical effort highlights the relevance of surface vacancies in catalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>Bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;Nanotubes with Tunable Helicity and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

The 2D nanosheets hierarchical assembled into diverse bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube with tunable helicity by a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; route. The diameter ratio of the upper to lower edge of each stacking truncated nanocone (RH) can be regulated to express the different helicity of the nanotube. The chiroptical nanoarchitectures show an enhanced and RH&#8208;dependent adjustable chirality and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).







Abstract
We report the fabrication of an exotic bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube via the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of a dipeptide&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide gelator with tunable helicity and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). It was found that in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) the gelator molecules self&#8208;assembled into a bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube, which is composed of truncated nanocones and CPL active. When defining the diameter ratio of the lower to upper edge of each nanocone as a parameter to express the helicity of different nanotubes, it was found that both the helicity and CPL of these nanotubes can be adjusted by the amount of TFA. Moreover, the helicity of the nanotube can be conveyed to the achiral quantum dots (QDs) and produce a hybrid nanotube/QDs CPL active materials with adjustable dissymmetry factor. This work finds a new type self&#8208;assembled bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube and unveils their helicity and CPL control.

A self&#8208;assembled homochiral anionic cage with dual binding modes acts as an efficient chiroptical sensor with a broad substrate scope in water.







Abstract
Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an anionic homochiral octahedral cage by condensing six Ga3+ cations and four trisacylhydrazone ligands. The robust nature of the hydrazone bond renders the cage stable in water, where it can take advantage of the hydrophobic effect for host&#8211;guest recognition. In addition to the internal binding site, namely, the inner cavity, the octahedral cage possesses four &#8220;windows&#8221;, each of which represents an external binding site allowing peripheral complexation. These internal and external binding sites endow the cage with the capability to bind a broad range of guests whose sizes could either be smaller than or exceed the volume of the cage&#8242;s inner cavity. Upon accommodation of a chiral guest, one of the two cage enantiomers becomes more favored than the other, producing circular&#8208;dichroism (CD) signals. The CD signal intensity of the cage is observed to be proportional to the ee value of the chiral guest, allowing a quantitative determination of the latter.

         <title>Uncovering the Role of Bicarbonate in Calcium Carbonate Formation at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16707-16713, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An important role of bicarbonate at near&#8208;neutral pH during CaCO3 formation was found. Its structural incorporation in amorphous intermediates, revealed by a combination of potentiometric titrations, NMR, computer simulations, and other techniques, can be quantitatively explained by a model based on the binding of bicarbonate ions to pre&#8208;nucleation clusters. The findings seem to be crucial for a better understanding of, e.g., CaCO3 biomineralization.







Abstract
Mechanistic pathways relevant to mineralization are not well&#8208;understood fundamentally, let alone in the context of their biological and geological environments. Through quantitative analysis of ion association at near&#8208;neutral pH, we identify the involvement of HCO3&#8722; ions in CaCO3 nucleation. Incorporation of HCO3&#8722; ions into the structure of amorphous intermediates is corroborated by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complemented by quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We identify the roles of HCO3&#8722; ions as being through (i)&#8197;competition for ion association during the formation of ion pairs and ion clusters prior to nucleation and (ii)&#8197;incorporation as a significant structural component of amorphous mineral particles. The roles of HCO3&#8722; ions as active soluble species and structural constituents in CaCO3 formation are of fundamental importance and provide a basis for a better understanding of physiological and geological mineralization.

         <title>FRET&#8208;Integrated Polymer Brushes for Spatially Resolved Sensing of Changes in Polymer Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16600-16606, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
FRET chemistry was integrated within stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer brush layers on planar substrates for spatial sensing of changing polymer conformations. Sensing was demonstrated for a variety of liquid mixture compositions, including high&#8208;resolution observation of lateral differences in polymer conformation at immiscible liquid interfaces (see picture), thus offering great potential to be leveraged for new surface&#8208;based sensing devices.







Abstract
Polymer brush surfaces that alter their physical properties in response to chemical stimuli have the capacity to be used as new surface&#8208;based sensing materials. For such surfaces, detecting the polymer conformation is key to their sensing capabilities. Herein, we report on FRET&#8208;integrated ultrathin (&lt;70&#8197;nm) polymer brush surfaces that exhibit stimuli&#8208;dependent FRET with changing brush conformation. Poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) polymers were chosen due their exceptional sensitivity to liquid mixture compositions and their ability to be assembled into well&#8208;defined polymer brushes. The brush transitions were used to optically sense changes in liquid mixture compositions with high spatial resolution (tens of micrometers), where the FRET coupling allowed for noninvasive observation of brush transitions around complex interfaces with real&#8208;time sensing of the liquid environment. Our methods have the potential to be leveraged towards greater surface&#8208;based sensing capabilities at intricate interfaces.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation&#8208;Based Construction of Axially and Centrally Chiral Indenes through Two Discrete Insertions</title>

Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of nitrones and coupling with different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N atropochiral and C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chiral indenes in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion, and they are constructed via two uncorrelated stereo&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
Reported herein is asymmetric [3+2] annulation of arylnitrones with different classes of alkynes catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) complexes, with the nitrone acting as an electrophilic directing group. Three classes of chiral indenes/indenones have been effectively constructed, depending on the nature of the substrates. The coupling system features mild reaction conditions, excellent enantioselectivity, and high atom&#8208;economy. In particular, the coupling of N&#8208;benzylnitrones and different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N atropochiral pentatomic biaryls with a C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chirality in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (45 examples, average 95.6&#8201;% ee). These chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion and they are constructed via two distinct migratory insertions that are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control.

         <title>Chemical Identification of Catalytically Active Sites on Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheet to Decipher the High Activity for Electro&#8208;synthesis Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16607-16614, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) has been demonstrated as highly effective catalyst for electrosynthesizing hydrogen peroxide with mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Chemical titration and DFT calculations were used to decipher the high activity for hydrogen peroxide production; the C=O groups are identified as the most active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an on&#8208;site and clean route. Oxygen&#8208;doped carbon materials with high ORR activity and H2O2 selectivity have been considered as the promising catalysts, however, there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence to identify true active sites at the complex carbon surface. Herein, we propose a chemical titration strategy to decipher the oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) catalyst for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR. The OCNS900 exhibits outstanding 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR performances with onset potential of 0.825&#8197;V (vs. RHE), mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in flow cell, surpassing most reported carbon catalysts. Through selective chemical titration of C=O, C&#8722;OH, and COOH groups, we found that C=O species contributed to the most electrocatalytic activity and were the most active sites for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, which were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2, a light driven cation channel with a retinal chromophore, undergoes a cyclic photoreaction with several photointermediates. Here, we analyze the chromophore configuration of the intermediates, which can be cryo&#8208;trapped, in detail by DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and reveal that the desensitized state is in a 13&#8208;cis,15&#8208;syn configuration. Our results also shed further light on the photocycle of the protein.







Abstract
Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) is a light&#8208;gated cation channel and was used to lay the foundations of optogenetics. Its dark state X&#8208;ray structure has been determined in 2017 for the wild&#8208;type, which is the prototype for all other ChR variants. However, the mechanistic understanding of the channel function is still incomplete in terms of structural changes after photon absorption by the retinal chromophore and in the framework of functional models. Hence, detailed information needs to be collected on the dark state as well as on the different photointermediates. For ChR2 detailed knowledge on the chromophore configuration in the different states is still missing and a consensus has not been achieved. Using DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state MAS NMR spectroscopy on proteoliposome samples, we unambiguously determined the chromophore configuration in the desensitized state, and we show that this state occurs towards the end of the photocycle.

Gram&#8208;scale organic semiconductor C5N2 NPs were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot bottom&#8208;up method. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one semiconductor, with a low band gap of 1.63&#8197;eV and inherent nucleus targeting and strong photooxidation capacity, could accumulate at cell nucleus, split H2O to produce O2 and also generate cytotoxia 1O2 under high&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable NIR irradiation, successfully achieving effective and enhanced PDT in a hypoxic tumor.







Abstract
Tumor hypoxia severely limits the therapeutic effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Although many methods for oxygen generation exist, substantial safety concerns, spatiotenporal uncontrollability, limited efficacy, and complicated procedures have compromised their practical application. Here, we demonstrate a biocompatiable all&#8208;in&#8208;one organic semiconductor to provide a photoxidation catalysis mechanism of action. A facile method is developed to produce gram&#8208;level C5N2 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based organic semiconductor. Under 650&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the semiconductor split water to generate O2 and simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), showing that the photocatalyst for O2 evolution and the photosensitizer (PS) for 1O2 generation could be synchronously achieved in one organic semiconductor. The inherent nucleus targeting capacity endows it with direct and efficient DNA photocleavage. These findings pave the way for developing organic semiconductor&#8208;based cancer therapeutic agents.

         <title>Azobispyrazole Family as Photoswitches Combining (Near&#8208;) Quantitative Bidirectional Isomerization and Widely Tunable Thermal Half&#8208;Lives from Hours to Years**

Azobispyrazoles are a family of bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo photoswitches that combine excellent E &#8646; Z photoisomerization yields and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years, showing the great potential of Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het architecture in developing high&#8208;performance molecular photoswitches.







Abstract
Azobenzenes are classical molecular photoswitches that have been widely used. In recent endeavors of molecular design, replacing one or both phenyl rings with heteroaromatic rings has emerged as a strategy to expand molecular diversity and access improved photoswitching properties. Many mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo molecules with unique structures and/or properties have been developed, but the potential of bis&#8208;heteroaryl architectures is far from fully exploited. We report a family of azobispyrazoles, which combine (near&#8208;)quantitative bidirectional photoconversion and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years. The two five&#8208;membered rings remarkably weaken the intramolecular steric hindrance, providing new possibilities for engineering the geometric and electronic structure of azo photoswitches. Azobispyrazoles generally exhibit twisted Z&#8208;isomers that facilitate complete Z&#8594;E photoisomerization, and their thermal stability can be broadly adjusted regardless of the twisted shape, overcoming the conflict between photoconversion (favored by the twisted shape) and Z&#8208;isomer stability (favored by the orthogonal shape) encountered by mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.

         <title>H2O&#8208;Built Proton Transfer Bridge Enhances Continuous Methane Oxidation to Methanol over Cu&#8208;BEA Zeolite</title>

H2O can directly participate in the continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM reaction through a proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;bridge over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu] site of Cu&#8208;BEA zeolite. This can significantly boost CH3OH production rate and enhance long&#8208;term reaction stability.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol (DMTM) is a big challenge in C1 chemistry. We present a continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM investigation by simultaneously introducing 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O into the reaction system over Cu&#8208;BEA zeolites. Combining a D2O isotopic tracer technique and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, we for the first time demonstrate that the H2O molecules can participate in the reaction through a proton transfer route, wherein the H2O molecules can build a high&#8208;speed proton transfer bridge between the generated moieties of CH3&#8722; and OH&#8722; over the evolved mono(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper ([Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+) active site, thereby pronouncedly boosting the CH3OH selectivity (3.1&#8594;71.6&#8201;%), productivity (16.8&#8594;242.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term reaction stability (10&#8594;70&#8197;h) relative to the scenario of absence of H2O. Unravelling the proton transfer of H2O over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+ site would substantially contribute to highly efficient catalyst designs for the continuous DMTM.

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;Range Polariton&#8208;Assisted Energy Transfer in Organic Microcavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16661-16667, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong&#8208;range polariton&#8208;assisted energy transfer was achieved in a microcavity containing two J&#8208;aggregate cyanine dyes. The two dyes were separated by a distance of up to 2 &#956;m using a polymeric spacer layer. Here, it was confirmed that hybrid middle polariton (MP) states, composed of a mixture between the cavity photon modes and the different exciton states, act as a route for efficient ultralong&#8208;range energy transfer to energetically lower&#8208;lying states.







Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative energy transfer between spatially&#8208;separated molecules in a microcavity can occur when an excitonic state on both molecules are strongly&#8208;coupled to the same optical mode, forming so&#8208;called &#8220;hybrid&#8221; polaritons. Such energy transfer has previously been explored when thin&#8208;films of different molecules are relatively closely spaced (&#8776;100&#8197;nm). In this manuscript, we explore strong&#8208;coupled microcavities in which thin&#8208;films of two J&#8208;aggregated molecular dyes were separated by a spacer layer having a thickness of up to 2&#8197;&#956;m. Here, strong light&#8208;matter coupling and hybridisation between the excitonic transition is identified using white&#8208;light reflectivity and photoluminescence emission. We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8220;mesoscopic distances&#8221;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.

Chimeric Lanthipeptides: Employing a tunable metabologenomic approach, nocathioamides&#8197;A&#8211;C were isolated and elucidated. They inaugurate a new RiPP family, characterized by a unique and hyper degree of modifications, including an intramolecular imide bridge.







Abstract
The increasing number of available genomes, in combination with advanced genome mining techniques, unveiled a plethora of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) coding for ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The products of these BGCs often represent an enormous resource for new and bioactive compounds, but frequently, they cannot be readily isolated and remain cryptic. Here, we describe a tunable metabologenomic approach that recruits a synergism of bioinformatics in tandem with isotope&#8208; and NMR&#8208;guided platform to identify the product of an orphan RiPP gene cluster in the genomes of Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 and 0706T. The application of this tactic resulted in the discovery of nocathioamides family as a founder of a new class of chimeric lanthipeptides I.

Mg&#8208;doped Li with about 5&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Mg (Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption&#8208;energy of Li from density functional theory calculations. Experimental tests demonstrate that Li&#8208;Mg5 exhibits superior cycling stability to pure Li and Li&#8208;Mg10 anodes in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage, leading to dense and less&#8208;corrosive Li deposition thus validating the simulation results.







Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;magnesium (Mg) alloy with limited Mg amount, which can also be called Mg&#8208;doped Li (Li&#8208;Mg), has been considered as a potential alternative anode for high energy density rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, the optimum doping&#8208;content of Mg in Li&#8208;Mg anode and the mechanism of the improved performance are not well understood. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the effect of Mg amount in Li&#8208;Mg anode. The Li&#8208;Mg with about 5&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Mg (abbreviated as Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption energy of Li, thus all the surface area can be &#8220;controlled&#8221; by Mg atoms, leading to the smooth and continuous deposition of Li on the surface around the Mg center. A localized high concentration electrolyte enables Li&#8208;Mg5 to exhibit the best cycling stability in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage, which is approaching the demand of practical application. This electrolyte also helps generate an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which leads to smooth, compact and less corrosion layer on the Li&#8208;Mg5 surface. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results prove that Li&#8208;Mg5 has optimum Mg content and gives best battery cycling performance.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Engineered Long&#8208;Range Electrostatic Interactions for DNA Hybridization Reactions</title>

DNA frameworks contained various guest particles with different surface charges were employed to exert diverse long&#8208;range electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single stranded DNA. Long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for determining the hybridization rate of the tethered DNA to its complementary sequence.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions beyond biomolecular interaction interfaces have not been extensively studied due to the limitation in engineering electric double layers in physiological fluids. Here we find that long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions play an essential role in kinetic modulation of DNA hybridizations. Protein and gold nanoparticles with different charges are encapsulated in tetrahedral frameworks to exert diverse electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single DNA strands. Using this strategy, we have successfully modulated the hybridization kinetics in both bulk solution and single molecule level. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for hybridization rates. This work validates the important role of long&#8208;range electrostatic forces in nucleic acid&#8208;biomacromolecule complexes, which may encourage new strategies of gene regulation, antisense therapy, and nucleic acid detection.

The CO ligation to two different ruthenium porphyrins on the Ag(111) surface under vacuum was investigated experimentally and theoretically. The electronic and geometric changes upon ligation as well as the energetics of the process were elucidated. The surface adaptability of the porphyrin macrocycle conformation proves crucial for CO binding.







Abstract
We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real&#8208;space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing&#8208;wave measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature&#8208;programmed desorption the binding strength. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.

         <title>Synthesis of a Boron&#8211;Imidazolate Framework Nanosheet with Dimer Copper Units for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16687-16692, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically well&#8208;defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dimer&#8208;copper sites are elaborated to modulate the reaction path of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). The BIF&#8208;102NSs catalyst with Cl&#8722; bridged dimer copper (Cu2) units shows higher catalytic activity and selectivity for C2H4, because the neighboring Cu monomers perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier and afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of the dependence between the structure and composition on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) would guide the rational design of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. A major impediment to the deep reduction CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products is the complexity of carbon&#8211;carbon bond coupling. The chemically well&#8208;defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites are required for these C&#8722;C coupling involved processes. Here, we developed a catalyst (BIF&#8208;102NSs) that features Cl&#8722; bridged dimer copper (Cu2) units, which delivers high catalytic activity and selectivity for C2H4. Mechanistic investigation verifies that neighboring Cu monomers not only perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier, but also afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers, resulting in greatly improved electroreduction performance for CO2.

         <title>Na9Bi5Os3O24: A Diamagnetic Oxide Featuring a Pronouncedly Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;Compressed Octahedral Coordination of Osmium(VI)</title>

A Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;compressed OsO6 octahedron resulting in an unprecedented large splitting of the t2g levels and a diamagnetic ground state has been observed.







Abstract
The Jahn&#8211;Teller (JT) theorem constitutes one of the most fundamental concepts in chemistry. In transition&#8208;element chemistry, the 3d4 and 3d9 configurations in octahedral complexes are particularly illustrative, where a distortion in local geometry is associated with a reduction of the electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate about the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate. In contrast, for Na9Bi5Os3O24, the octahedron around Os6+(5d2) is heavily compressed, lifting the degeneracy of the t2g set of 5d orbitals such that in the sense of a JT compression a diamagnetic ground state results. This effect is not forced by structural constraints, the structure offers sufficient space for osmium to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide new insights in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems.

Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6&#8201;% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.

         <title>Formulating the Electrolyte Towards High&#8208;Energy and Safe Rechargeable Lithium&#8211;Metal Batteries</title>

Formulation of conventional electrolyte composition yields a hybrid solid/liquid electrolyte that is electrochemically compatible with the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, which promises stable operation of a practical 10&#8208;Ah&#8208;grade pouch cell with a specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8211;metal batteries with a cell&#8208;level specific energy of &gt;400&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 are highly desired for next&#8208;generation storage applications, yet the research has been retarded by poor electrolyte&#8211;electrode compatibility and rigorous safety concerns. We demonstrate that by simply formulating the composition of conventional electrolytes, a hybrid electrolyte was constructed to ensure high (electro)chemical and thermal stability with both the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes. By employing the new electrolyte, Li&#8741;LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells show favorable cycling and rate performance, and a 10&#8197;Ah Li&#8741;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell demonstrates a practical specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our findings shed light on reasonable design principles for electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interfaces toward practical realization of high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries.

         <title>A Pair of Cobalt(III/IV) Terminal Imido Complexes</title>

Straightforward access to a cobalt(IV) terminal imido complex was provided by one&#8208;electron oxidation of a cobalt(III) terminal imido precursor. The cobalt(IV) monoimido complex could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure and the d5 low&#8208;spin, S=
, electron configuration.







Abstract
The reaction of the cobalt(I) complex [(TIMMNmes)CoI](BPh4) (2) (TIMMNmes=tris&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)methyl]amine) with 1&#8208;adamantylazide yields the cobalt(III) imido complex [(TIMMNmes)CoIII(NAd)](BPh4) (3) with concomitant release of dinitrogen. The N&#8208;anchor in diamagnetic 3 features an unusual, planar tertiary amine, which results from repulsive electrostatic interaction with the filled d(z2)&#8208;orbital of the cobalt ion and negative hyperconjugation with the neighboring methylene groups. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 with [FeCp2](OTf) provides access to the rare, high&#8208;valent cobalt(IV) imido complex [(TIMMNmes)CoIV(NAd)](OTf)2 (4). Despite a half&#8208;life of less than 1&#8197;h at room temperature, 4 could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure and the d5 low&#8208;spin, S=
, electron configuration. A computational analysis of 4 suggests high covalency within the CoIV=NAd bond with non&#8208;negligible spin density located at the imido moiety, which translates into substantial triplet nitrene character.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E</title>

An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (APEDA) reaction was developed for the asymmetric total synthesis of the aryltetralin cyclic ether lignans aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E (see scheme) and enabled revision of the absolute configuration of these natural products. The strategy was also used to synthesize the aryldihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8722;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidin&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin and to build a small library of lignans (27 members).







Abstract
An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction between electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactones was developed to directly construct the basic tricyclic core of aryltetralin lactone lignans. This methodology enabled the first asymmetric total synthesis of aglacins&#8197;A, B, and E and revision of the absolute configuration of these natural lignans. The strategy was also used to prepare the naturally occurring aryldihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8722;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidin&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin in four and six steps, as well as 27 natural&#8208;product&#8208;like molecules containing a C8&#8242; quaternary center. We believe that the synthetic aglacins and small&#8208;molecule library provide new opportunities to carry out the SAR studies of the podophyllotoxin family of natural products.

         <title>Cationic Heterobimetallic Mg(Zn)/Al(Ga) Combinations for Cooperative C&#8211;F Bond Cleavage</title>

Together strong: Electron&#8208;rich low&#8208;valent AlI and electron&#8208;poor Zn2+ centers cooperatively cleave the unactivated, strong C&#8722;F bond in fluorobenzene via a dearomatization&#8211;rearomatization mechanism.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent (MeBDI)Al and (MeBDI)Ga and highly Lewis acidic cations in [(tBuBDI)M+&#8901;C6H6][(B(C6F5)4&#8722;] (M=Mg or Zn, MeBDI=HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPP]2, tBuBDI=HC[C(tBu)N&#8208;DIPP]2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) react to heterobimetallic cations [(tBuBDI)Mg&#8211;Al(MeBDI)+], [(tBuBDI)Mg&#8211;Ga(MeBDI)+] and [(tBuBDI)Zn&#8211;Ga(MeBDI)+]. These cations feature long Mg&#8211;Al (or Ga) bonds while the Zn&#8211;Ga bond is short. The [(tBuBDI)Zn&#8211;Al(MeBDI)+] cation was not formed. Combined AIM and charge calculations suggest that the metal&#8211;metal bonds to Zn are considerably more covalent, whereas those to Mg should be described as weak AlI(or GaI)&#8594;Mg2+ donor bonds. Failure to isolate the Zn&#8211;Al combination originates from cleavage of the C&#8722;F bond in the solvent fluorobenzene to give (tBuBDI)ZnPh and (MeBDI)AlF+ which is extremely Lewis acidic and was not observed, but (MeBDI)Al(F)&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;F)&#8208;(F)Al(MeBDI)+ was verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations show that the remarkably facile C&#8211;F bond cleavage follows a dearomatization/rearomatization route.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning of Chiral Microenvironments within Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates for Enhanced Enantioselectivity</title>

The self&#8208;assembly of a new family of triple&#8208;stranded helicates with fascinating chiral characteristics from axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;type ligands are reported. The fine&#8208;tuning of chiral microenvironments within the well&#8208;defined complexes has enabled outstanding chiral discrimination properties, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35).







Abstract
Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of chiral helicates. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded ZnII2L3 complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and ZnII. Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global supramolecular chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates that their chiral discrimination are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Second Time&#8208;Resolved Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Reveals Dynamic CO Intermediates during Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper</title>

Time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) reveals the dynamics of the CO2 reduction reaction over Cu surfaces with a sub&#8208;second time resolution of 717&#8197;ms per spectrum. Anodic treatment and subsequent reduction result in a highly active surface for both SERS and ethylene production within 7&#8197;s. A dynamic CO intermediate below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1 correlates with CO&#8208;CO coupling and ethylene formation, and a static CO intermediate with a vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1 relates to CO production.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) into hydrocarbons is a promising approach for greenhouse gas mitigation, but many details of this dynamic reaction remain elusive. Here, time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) is employed to successfully monitor the dynamics of CO2RR intermediates and Cu surfaces with sub&#8208;second time resolution. Anodic treatment at 1.55&#8197;V vs. RHE and subsequent surface oxide reduction (below &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) induced roughening of the Cu electrode surface, which resulted in hotspots for TR&#8208;SERS, enhanced time resolution (down to &#8776;0.7&#8197;s) and fourfold improved CO2RR efficiency toward ethylene. With TR&#8208;SERS, the initial restructuring of the Cu surface was followed (&lt;7&#8197;s), after which a stable surface surrounded by increased local alkalinity was formed. Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1, is related to C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production (&#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

Playfully easy! The targeted combination of organo&#8208; and biocatalysts enables the scalable conversion of inexpensive commercial substrates into a library of highly valuable enantiomerically pure synthetic building blocks for natural product synthesis. The approach included newly designed monomers for radical polymerization, as described by J&#246;rg Pietruszka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;16700. Graphic design: Irene K&#252;berl.

A round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructure (SiJAR) fitted with a Mn&#8208;silicate lid was fabricated by Amit Kumar, In&#8197;Su Lee et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;16337 through thermal solid&#8208;state conversion chemistry. SiJAR was employed as catalytic nanoreactor accommodating nanocrystals and enzymes, which performed asymmetric aldol reactions inside living cells.

Combining junction enhanced Raman and conductance spectroscopies provides a novel approach for studying chemical systems at the single molecule level. In their Research Article on page&#8197;16436, Joshua Hihath&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;show that by simultaneously measuring the transport properties and the Raman response of a single molecule it is possible to extract multidimensional information about the junction's mechanical, electrical, and optical properties to understand the role of structural dynamics on molecular charge transport.

Direct conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2&#160;into value&#8208;added compounds remains a major challenge. Simultaneous one&#8208;pot coupling of a synthetic CO2&#8208;fixing cycle with a natural glyoxylate assimilation module and different natural product biosynthetic pathways enables the production of valuable terpenes and polyketides directly from CO2. Demonstration of this modular in vitro platform sets the stage for harnessing the greenhouse gas CO2&#160;as source for the sustainable synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon compounds, as reported by Tobias&#8197;J. Erb et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;16420.

Simultaneous one-pot coupling of a synthetic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing cycle with a natural glyoxylate assimilation module and different natural product biosynthetic pathways enables the production of valuable terpenes and polyketides directly from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Demonstration of this modular in vitro platform sets the stage for harnessing the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;as source for the sustainable synthesis of multi-carbon compounds, as reported by Tobias&#8197;J. Erb et&#8197;al. in their Communication on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202102333"&gt;page&#8197;16420&lt;/a&gt;.

Molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can expand the chemical and physical properties of conventional rigid porous solids and drive the development of sophisticated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This Minireview emphasizes the strategies for the localization and characterization of molecular rotors in porous materials as well as the exploration of their rotor&#8208;induced specific functionalities.







Abstract
Advanced porous materials (APMs)&#8212;such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs)&#8212;have emerged as an exciting research frontier of chemistry and materials science. Given their tunable pore size and extensive diversity, APMs have found widespread applications. In addition, adding dynamic functional groups to porous solids furthers the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. By incorporating moving elements&#8212;molecular rotors&#8212;into the porous frameworks, molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;driven advanced porous materials (MR&#8208;APMs) can respond reversibly to chemical and physical stimuli, thus imparting dynamic functionalities that have not been found in conventional porous materials. This Minireview discusses exemplary MR&#8208;APMs in terms of their design, synthesis, rotor dynamics, and potential applications.

Fluorescence imaging in the NIR&#8208;II window has become a powerful method for biomedical research owing the combined merits of diminished background fluorescence and deep tissue penetration. NIR&#8208;II fluorophores occupy a central position in this technology. This review discusses the strategies applied in the design of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes.







Abstract
The development of fluorophores for the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) represents an emerging, significant, and vibrant field in analytic chemistry, chemical biology, and biomedical engineering. The wavelength, brightness, and stability are three crucial factors that determine the performance of an NIR&#8208;II fluorophore. Up to now, significant progress has been made in the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence molecular probes, including the synthesis of D&#8208;A&#8208;D and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores with improved NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging performance and the construction of off&#8211;on probes and ratiometric probes via energy transfer or molecular structure modification. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances in molecular engineering design strategies of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and probes, then highlight a selection of bioimaging and biosensing applications. We also provide perspectives on potential challenges and opportunities in this emerging field

         <title>Photocatalysis Enhanced by External Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16309-16328, July 19, 2021. </description>

External fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, external electric field, magnetic field, and coupled multiple fields, provide an effective and facile strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy by means of photocatalysis shows huge potential to relieve the ongoing energy crisis and increasing environmental pollution. However, unsatisfactory conversion efficiency still hinders its practical application. The introduction of external fields can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors from the inside out. This review focuses on recent advances in the application of diverse external fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, electric field, magnetic field, and coupled fields, to boost photocatalytic reactions, for applications in, for example, contaminant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and bacterial inactivation. The relevant reinforcement mechanisms of photoabsorption, the transport and separation of photoinduced charges, and adsorption of reagents by the external fields are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and outlook for the development of external&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced photocatalysis are presented.

         <title>Doubling the Stakes: The Promise of Halide Double Perovskites</title>

Two B sites in combination dictate the properties of halide double perovskites (A2BB&#8242;X6; A=monocation, X=halide). This Minireview gives a brief overview of the rich history of halide double perovskites, highlights key structural and electronic aspects, and describes the current understanding on how to correctly select the B&#8208;site pairs that afford the desired properties.







Abstract
When the stakes are doubled in a wager, a player must correctly place two consecutive bets to win, but the payout is larger. Similarly, two B sites in combination dictate the properties of A2BB&#8242;X6 (A=monocation, X=halide) double perovskites. Correctly picking two B sites is more challenging than picking just one, as in the AIBIIX3 single perovskites, but the options are greater and, we believe, the rewards are higher when the stakes are doubled. In this Minireview, we emphasize fundamental aspects of halide double perovskites to provide a foundation for interested readers to explore this extraordinary class of materials. In particular, we highlight the differences and similarities between double and single perovskites and describe how the double perovskite structure potentially offers greater control over photophysical properties.

         <title>Interfacial Microenvironment Modulation Boosting Electron Transfer between Metal Nanoparticles and MOFs for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16372-16376, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), are encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Systemic investigations suggest that the PVP presents negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF, and the PVP removal greatly boosts photocatalysis.







Abstract
Interfacial electron transfer between cocatalyst and photosensitizer is key in heterogeneous photocatalysis, yet the underlying mechanism remains subtle and unclear. Surfactant coated on the metal cocatalysts, greatly modulating the microenvironment of catalytic sites, is largely ignored. Herein, a series of Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), were encapsulated into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, to afford PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PtrPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, and Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The PVP appears to have a negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF. Compared with PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the removal of interfacial PVP improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, boosting photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Herein, a series of Pt co-catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as Pt&lt;sub&gt;PVP&lt;/sub&gt;), Pt with partially removed PVP (Pt&lt;sub&gt;rPVP&lt;/sub&gt;), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), were encapsulated into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to afford Pt&lt;sub&gt;PVP&lt;/sub&gt;@UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Pt&lt;sub&gt;rPVP&lt;/sub&gt;@UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Pt@UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The PVP appears to have a negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF. Compared with Pt&lt;sub&gt;PVP&lt;/sub&gt;@UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the removal of interfacial PVP improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, boosting photocatalytic hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;

We report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields up to 30&#8211;46&#8201;% for high&#8208;performance warm&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
The negative impact of rare&#8208;earth elements (REEs) on the environment, limited supply and high cost prompt the need for REE&#8208;free phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields up to 30&#8211;46&#8201;%. This was achieved using cyano&#8208;group&#8208;bearing p&#8208;phenyldiacetonitrile as precursor and forming carbon quantum rings of different diameters through the linkage of curved carbon quantum ribbons of different lengths. The results show the role of cyano groups in inducing the curvature of the carbon quantum ribbons for CQR formation and emission of stable solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescence. R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs emitted warm white light with low CCT (3576&#8197;K), high CRI (96.6), and high luminous efficiency (48.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1), comparable to REE&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Aminoalkylboronic Acids from Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Boryl Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16366-16371, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the prevalence of boron&#8208;based therapeutics and inhibitors there is a dearth of methods to modulate oxidative stability of boronic acids. The introduction of fluorine atoms is known to increase oxidative stability of organic molecules, but fluoroalkyl groups connected to boron are unstable. Here we show that fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids are stable within a wide range of pH values, along with evidence of cyclic and linear conformers at basic pH.







Abstract
Our ongoing search for underdeveloped functional group combinations has brought to light &#945;&#8208;fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids, a new class of molecules featuring the B&#8208;CF linkage. These compounds can now be generated from secondary amines and &#945;&#8208;boryl aldehydes through electrophilic fluorination of boryl enamines or enamides. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids show no signs of degradation under ambient conditions. We present evidence for the involvement of chair&#8208;like motifs, favored over the acyclic forms by up to 1.7&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in water and held together by an amine&#8208;boronate hydrogen bond. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids are stable over a wide pH range and are characterized by a pKa of 3.4, which is the lowest of any alkylboronic acid.

         <title>Silica Jar&#8208;with&#8208;Lid as Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Compartment for Enantioselective Synthesis inside Living Cells</title>

Round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructure (SiJAR) fitted with a Mn&#8208;silicate lid was fabricated through the highly controlled thermal solid&#8208;state conversion of a MnO nanocrystal at the inside of hollow SiO2 shell. The lid aperture&#8208;opening created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor accommodating catalytic metal nanocrystals and enzymes, which performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity inside living cells.







Abstract
Nanodevices, harvesting the power of synthetic catalysts and enzymes to perform enantioselective synthesis inside cell, have never been reported. Here, we synthesized round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructures (SiJARs) with a chemo&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;silicate lid. This was isolated as an intermediate structure during highly controlled solid&#8208;state nanocrystal&#8208;conversion at the arc&#8208;section of silica shell. Different catalytic noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru) were selectively modified on the lid&#8208;section through galvanic reactions. And, lid aperture&#8208;opening was regulated by mild acidic conditions or intracellular environment which accommodated the metal nanocrystals and enzymes, and in turn created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor. Distinct from the free enzymes, SiJARs performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity (yield &gt;99&#8201;%, ee=95&#8201;%) and also functioned as the artificial catalytic organelles inside living cells. This work bridges the enormous potential of sophisticated nanocrystal&#8208;conversion chemistry and advanced platforms for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature catalysis.

In a competing process, unstable amine species evolve on the surface, which desorb in the course of the reaction. Obtained atomistic&#8208;level insights into the formation and dynamic evolution of the active ligand layer under operational conditions provide important input required for controlling chemoselectivity by purposeful surface functionalization.

PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids, a new method for the synthesis of a wide range of cyclic anhydrides, is reported. Decarboxylative functionalization of the installed carboxyl group provides access to diverse &#946;&#8208;functionalized aliphatic acids. The enantioselective C&#8211;H carbonylation of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids is also achieved.







Abstract
The development of C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalizations of free carboxylic acids has provided a wide range of versatile C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Y (Y=heteroatom) bond&#8208;forming reactions. Additionally, C&#8211;H functionalizations have lent themselves to the one&#8208;step preparation of a number of valuable synthetic motifs that are often difficult to prepare through conventional methods. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids using Mo(CO)6 as a convenient solid CO source and enabled by a bidentate ligand, leading to convenient syntheses of cyclic anhydrides. Among these, the succinic anhydride products are versatile stepping stones for the mono&#8208;selective introduction of various functional groups at the &#946; position of the parent acids by decarboxylative functionalizations, thus providing a divergent strategy to synthesize a myriad of carboxylic acids inaccessible by previous &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H activation reactions. The enantioselective carbonylation of free cyclopropanecarboxylic acids has also been achieved using a chiral bidentate thioether ligand

         <title>Electrical Loss Management by Molecularly Manipulating Dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) towards 16.93&#8201;% CsPbI2Br Solar Cells</title>

An electrical loss management strategy by using SMe&#8208;TATPyr molecule manipulating dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been developed and employed to fabricate efficient and thermally stable CsPbI2Br solar cells. The P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr presents optimized molecular orientation, favorable energy level alignment and effective defect passivation. Based on P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTLs, the fabricated devices yield a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93&#8201;% for CsPbI2Br solar cells with dopant&#8208;free HTLs.







Abstract
Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites offer a pathway towards thermally stable photovoltaics. However, moisture&#8208;induced phase degradation restricts the application of hole transport layers (HTLs) with hygroscopic dopants. Dopant&#8208;free HTLs fail to realize efficient photovoltaics due to severe electrical loss. Herein, we developed an electrical loss management strategy by manipulating poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) with a small molecule, i.e., SMe&#8208;TATPyr. The developed P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTL shows a three&#8208;time increase of carrier mobility owing to breaking the long&#8208;range ordering of &#8220;edge&#8208;on&#8221; P3HT and inducing the formation of &#8220;face&#8208;on&#8221; clusters, over 50&#8201;% decrease of the perovskite surface defect density, and a reduced voltage loss at the perovskite/HTL interface because of favorable energy level alignment. The CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93&#8201;% for dopant&#8208;free HTL, and superior moisture and thermal stability by maintaining 96&#8201;% efficiency at low&#8208;humidity condition (10&#8211;25&#8201;% R. H.) for 1500&#8197;hours and over 95&#8201;% efficiency after annealing at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a Ruthenium&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Mobile Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16404-16408, July 19, 2021. </description>

Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was applied as the first ruthenium&#8208;based mobile catalyst to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. The RuII catalyst was discovered to interact with both CO2 molecules and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting CO2RR and delaying carbonate formation and consequently leading to lowered overpotential, enlarged capacity, and prolonged cyclability of the batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are regarded as next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical devices. However, the greatest challenge arises from the formation of the discharge product, Li2CO3, which would accumulate and deactivate heterogenous catalysts to cause huge polarization. Herein, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was employed as a solution&#8208;phase catalyst for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries and proved to be the most effective one screened so far. Spectroscopy and electrochemical analyses elucidate that the RuII center could interact with both CO2 and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting electroreduction process and delaying carbonate transformation. As a result, the charge potential is reduced to 3.86&#8197;V and over 60 discharge/charge cycles are achieved with a fixed capacity of 1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work provides a new avenue to improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with efficient mobile catalysts.

Two polyarylether&#8208;based polymers with single/double linking patterns were investigated to establish the effect of the linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process in D&#8211;A conjugated polymer photocatalysts, thus achieving remarkable photocatalytic HER and HPER performances.







Abstract
Charge generation and separation are regarded as the major constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein, two new linear polyarylether&#8208;based polymers (PAE&#8211;CPs) with distinct linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the influence of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results revealed that compared to the traditional single&#8208;stranded linker, the double&#8208;stranded linking pattern strengthens donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in PAE&#8211;CPs and generates a coplanar structure, facilitating charge generation and separation, and enabling red&#8208;shifted light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8211;CP interlinked with a double&#8208;stranded linker exhibits markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to that of its single&#8208;strand&#8208;linked analogue. Such findings can facilitate the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Biphasic Electrolyte Inhibiting the Shuttle Effect of Redox Molecules in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A biphasic electrolyte containing solvents with differing polarities, as well as lithium salts, was used to inhibit the shuttle effect of redox molecules. The cycling stability of lithium rechargeable batteries was substantially improved.







Abstract
Redox molecules (RMs) as electron carriers have been widely used in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices (ESDs), such as lithium redox flow batteries and lithium&#8208;O2 batteries. Unfortunately, migration of RMs to the lithium (Li) anode leads to side reactions, resulting in reduced coulombic efficiency and early cell death. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study utilizes a biphasic organic electrolyte to resolve this issue, in which nonafluoro&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrahydrohexyl&#8208;trimethoxysilane (NFTOS) and ether (or sulfone) with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) can be separated to form the immiscible anolyte and catholyte. RMs are extracted to the catholyte due to the enormous solubility coefficients in the biphasic electrolytes with high and low polarity, resulting in inhibition of the shuttle effect. When coupled with a lithium anode, the Li&#8208;Li symmetric, Li redox flow and Li&#8208;O2 batteries can achieve considerably prolonged cycle life with biphasic electrolytes. This concept provides a promising strategy to suppress the shuttle effect of RMs in ESDs.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Lignin Oil to Diesel Precursors and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16399-16403, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lignin to diesel precursors route was achieved via solar driven coupling reaction over Au/CdS photocatalyst. The diesel precursors can be further hydrogenated to C16&#8211;C18 cyclic hydrocarbons or aromatics over Pd/C or CoMoS&#8208;P, respectively.







Abstract
Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C&#8722;C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co&#8208;generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 dimers and 1.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16&#8211;C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin&#8208;to&#8208;diesel route.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Copper Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Selective and Stable Electroreduction of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16409-16415, July 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;based 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was synthesized. With the synergic effect of hexaazatrinaphthylene and copper node, the resultant HATNA&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF displays high selectivity and stability toward the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to methane.







Abstract
2D conjugated MOFs have attracted significant interests in recent years owing to their special structural features and promising physical and chemical properties. These intriguing attributes, to a large extent, stem from the nature of incorporated ligands. The available ligands for the construction of 2D conjugated MOFs are still limited, especially those that have heteroatoms included and exposed to the pores. In this work, we designed and synthesized a highly symmetric hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA)&#8208;based ligand with two different coordination sites. Through selective coordination, a highly crystalline and porous 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was constructed. Due to the synergic effects of HATNA and copper catecholate node, this HATNA&#8208;based 2D conjugated MOF can mediate the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane with high selectivity of 78&#8201;% at high current density of 8.2&#8197;milliamperes per square centimetre (mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for long durability over 12&#8197;hours.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Inorganic Tin Perovskite Solar Cells Prepared by Templated Growth</title>

A templated growth approach, in which the crystallization of a 3D perovskite is guided by a dynamically dominant 2D structure, was established for the fabrication of a low&#8208;dimensional perovskite thin film with an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size. The template growth is enabled by the reduced crystallization barrier of the 2D PEA2SnI4&#8722;xSCNx intermediate.







Abstract
The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on the precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite, CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x, with a mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. A kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2 and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form a 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of the 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8722;x(SCN)x. The film shows an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and a large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability, and oxidation resistance. A solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01&#8201;%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8722;x perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air.

         <title>A Modular In&#8197;Vitro Platform for the Production of Terpenes and Polyketides from CO2</title>

Coupling of a synthetic CO2&#8208;fixing cycle and a natural glyoxylate assimilation cycle with different biosynthetic pathways enables the sustainable production of terpenes and polyketides. Demonstration of this modular, multi&#8208;enzyme in&#8197;vitro platform sets the stage for a diversified synthesis of pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals directly from CO2.







Abstract
A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO2 as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, fragrances and food additives. Here we developed a modular in&#8197;vitro platform for the continuous conversion of CO2 into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO2 into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simultaneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29&#8197;enzymes in one pot, which paves the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO2&#8208;based chemicals in the future.

Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the key intermediates acetyl- and malonyl-CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof-of-principle study demonstrates the simultaneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29&#8197;enzymes in one pot, which paves the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based chemicals in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Colorimetric Metal&#8208;Free Detection of Carbon Monoxide: Reversible CO&#8197;Uptake by a BNB Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>

Acridan&#8208;derived receptors featuring an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor functionalized cavity offer a metal&#8208;free approach for binding carbon monoxide. Reversibility can be tuned through borane Lewis acidity and the binding event signalled colorimetrically.







Abstract
We report two BNB&#8208;type frustrated Lewis pairs which feature an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor functionalized cavity, and which differ in the nature of the B&#8208;bound fluoroaryl group (C6F5 vs. C6H3(CF3)2&#8208;3,5, Arf). These receptor systems are capable of capturing gaseous CO, and in the case of the &#8208;BArf2 system this can be shown to occur in reversible fashion at/above room temperature. For both systems, the binding event is accompanied by migration of one of the aryl substituents to the electrophilic carbon of the CO guest. Experiments utilizing an additional equivalent of PtBu3 allow the initially formed (non&#8208;migrated) CO adduct to be identified and trapped (via demethylation), while also establishing the reversibility of the B&#8208;to&#8208;C migration process. When partnered with the slightly less Lewis acidic &#8208;BArf2 substituent, this reversibility allows for release of the captured carbon monoxide in the temperature range 40&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, and the possibility for CO sensing, making use of the associated colourless to orange/red colour change.

         <title>Healable and Rearrangeable Networks of Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Diselenide Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 30, Page 16394-16398, July 19, 2021. </description>

A novel exchangeable diselenide chain extender is incorporated into an LCE system, bringing about the reprogrammability and the healability under visible&#8208;light irradiation or upon thermal treatment. These properties enable the utilization of a self&#8208;welding strategy to fabricate the complex LCE&#8208;based soft actuators without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator).







Abstract
Based on liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, hierarchically structured soft actuators can meet some requirements for &#8220;human&#8208;friendly&#8221; working mode and execute complex tasks with intelligent adaptation to environmental changes. However, few researchers have paid much attention to the preparation methods of multicomponent/hierarchical LCE actuators. In this communication, we demonstrate the successful integration of an exchangeable diselenide chain extender for the preparation of dynamic LCEs, which could be reprogrammed on heating or under visible light illumination. Moreover, the rearrangeable polydiselenide networks could be applied to develop the self&#8208;welding technology toward fabricating hierarchically structured LCE actuators with sophisticated deformability without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator) during the assembling process.

         <title>Azacalix[3]triazines: A Substructure of Triazine&#8208;Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>

Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has drawn considerable interest since the discovery of its metal&#8208;free photocatalytic properties. The synthesis of a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN), azacalix[3]triazines, is reported. The material exhibits super strong basicity as well as anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has garnered broad research interest due to its unique catalytic properties. However, GCN, prepared by general methods, possesses myriad structural defects and it has been difficult to elucidate their intrinsic physical properties. We report the development of azacalix[3]triazines (AC3Ts), a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN). Despite the electron&#8208;deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. We reveal the unique anion&#8208;&#960; interactions of AC3Ts that alters the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz&#8208;GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the usage scope and possibilities for GCNs.

         <title>Fuel driven and enzyme regulated redox responsive supramolecular hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reaction networks (CRN) embedded in hydrogels can transform responsive materials into complex self&#8211;regulating materials that generate feedback response to counter the effect of external stimuli. This study presents hydrogels containing the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) and ferrocene (Fc) host&#8208;guest pair as supramolecular crosslinks where redox responsive behavior is driven by the enzyme&#8208;fuel couples horse radish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;H2O2 and glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;D&#8208;glucose. The hydrogel can be tuned from a responsive to a self&#8208;regulating supramolecular system by varying the concentration of added reduction fuel D&#8208;glucose. The onset of self&#8208;regulating behavior is due to formation of oxidation fuel in the hydrogel by a cofactor intermediate GOx[FADH2]. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, rheology and kinetic modelling were employed to understand the emergence of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior and reveal the programmable negative feedback response of the hydrogel, including the adaptation of its elastic modulus and its potential as a glucose sensor.</dc:description>
