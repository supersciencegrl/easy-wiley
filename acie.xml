         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Axial Ligand Enables Synthesis of Allenylsilane through Dirhodium(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ON&#8208;OFF effect of amine ligand enabled Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of propargyl ester bearing a terminal alkyne moiety using hydrosilane was achieved. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the improvement of reactivity. The tertiary amine plays a significant role in assisting the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.







Abstract
Described herein is a dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed silylation of propargyl esters with hydrosilanes, using tertiary amines as axial ligands. By adopting this strategy, a range of versatile and useful allenylsilanes can be achieved with good yields. This reaction not only represents a SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of the propargyl derivatives bearing a terminal alkyne moiety to synthesize allenylsilanes from simple hydrosilanes, but also represents a new application of dirhodium(II) complexes in catalytic transformation of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond. The highly functionalized allenylsilanes that are produced can be transformed into a series of synthetically useful organic molecules. In this reaction, an intriguing ON&#8208;OFF effect of the amine ligand was observed. The reaction almost did not occur (OFF) without addition of Lewis base amine ligand. However, the reaction took place smoothly (ON) after addition of only catalytic amount of amine ligand. Detailed mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reactivity can be delicately improved by the use of tertiary amine. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts Allenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5:0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1 atm to 2.5 GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8208;I&#8208;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8208; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8208; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.</dc:description>

In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;S&#8211;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8211;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37 mg L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97% for over 200 hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8211;S&#8211;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Interactions Promoted Activation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia over Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high&#8208;efficiency electrode Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4 (Ag1.5Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag1.5Co/CC is ~81 times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co3O4, which stabilize the CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4 and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO3&#8722;) as well as intermediates (NO2&#8722; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance NRA electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589 nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out switch of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expansion of Structure Property in Cascade Nazarov Cyclization and Cycloexpansion&#160;Reaction to Diverse Angular Tricycles and Total Synthesis of Nominal Madreporanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction was developed for the precise synthesis of the angularly fused M/5/N (M = 5, 6; N = 4&#8722;9, 13) tricyclic skeletons. The prioritized expansion of the first ring played a critical role in the transformations, due to the release of ring strain, and the nature of the substituents present on the substrate is another influencing factor. This pioneering cascade reaction features broad substrates scope (33 examples), short reaction time, exceptional yields (up to 95%), and remarkable regioselectivities (&gt; 20:1). Exploiting the synthetic application of this cascade reaction, we successfully executed a succinct total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. We introduce a novel cleavable&#160;&#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of&#160;&#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with&#160;&#946;&#8208;ketoester through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, cross&#8208;links&#160;with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. Cross&#8208;linking improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young&#8217;s modulus and toughness that reach up to 656 MPa and 84 MJ cm&#8208;3, i.e. 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, allowing the almost PVA excellent recovery (&gt; 90%) . In the absence of thermal or acidic treatment, cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to synthesize substituted phenols represents a significant challenge in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe a novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) catalytic system that converts substituted cyclohexanones into the corresponding phenols. This process involves the successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within the six&#8208;membered ring of cyclohexanones and utilizes molecular oxygen to drive the reaction cycle. It demonstrates a versatile and efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted phenols, providing a valuable complement to existing chemical methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Indolyl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advancements in catalytic synthesis of axial chirality, reports on non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers remain limited because of the stringent steric requirements necessary to establish effective rotational brakes. In this study, we present a novel class of monoaryl atropisomers, indolyl ketosulfoxonium ylides, and describe an organocatalytic protocol for their synthesis. We discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) serves as an effective catalyst for the highly enantioselective iodination of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a strong preference for the intended iodination process over the competing protonation was observed. Subsequently, intramolecular amide cyclization enabled the formation of sterically congested indole fragments. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated by showcasing versatile transformations into other chiral scaffolds with complete retention of optical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are employed to covalently anchor Au and Ag atoms, resulting in bimetallic random copolymers, as reported by Ali Nazemi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409800). When these polymers are used as substrates and undergo reduction, they produce polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8208;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles, whose structures are influenced by the proportion of each metal in the metallopolymer. These nanomaterials have been shown to be effective in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

         <title>The Use of Photocycloaddition Reactions to Drive Mechanical Motions Resembling Humanoid Movements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline molecular material with olefinic groups has been used to achieve photomechanical motion in both single crystals and single&#8208;crystal composite films. This dimerization of dipyridyl ligands by [2+2] photocycloaddition introduces strain within the crystal, resulting in a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical including reversible bending and curling, movements that resemble a human performing various gymnastic exercises.







Abstract
With the aim of producing a photomechanical material for incorporation in soft microrobots, a one&#8208;dimensional diene coordination polymer (CP) [Cd(F&#8208;bpeb)(3&#8208;CBA)2]n (CP1, F&#8208;bpeb=4,4&#8242;&#8208;((1E,1&#8242;E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(ethene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl))dipyridine, 3&#8208;HCBA=3&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid) was synthesized and characterized. Irradiation of CP1 with ultraviolet (UV) or visible light causes [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions resulting in the introduction of crystal strain which triggers various types of crystal movements. Composite films of CP1&#8208;PVA (SC) fabricated by dispersing CP1 crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution allow amplification of the crystal movement so that the film strips exhibit fast and flexible curling upon photoirradiation. The composite films may be cut into long rectangular strips and folded to simulate soft microrobots which exhibit a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical movements resembling a human performing various gymnastic exercises.

         <title>From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this combined experimental (X&#8208;ray structure analysis) and computational (DFT&#8208;D3 calculations) study we have systematically evaluated the &#960;&#8208;hole donor ability of elements across Groups 9 to 12 using metalated porphyrins (ppys) as model systems. The results obtained will make impact in the fields supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and catalysis, where noncovalent Lewis Base&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal interactions play a crucial role.







Abstract
Herein we have evidenced the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;hole Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal noncovalent interactions (NCIs) involving elements from groups 9, 11 and 12. More in detail, M (M=Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) containing porphyrins have been synthesized and their supramolecular assemblies structurally characterized by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses, revealing the formation of directional Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts in addition to ancillary hydrogen bond and lone pair&#8208;&#960; bonds. Computations at the PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory revealed the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction. In addition, the physical nature of these NCIs was studied using Quantum Chemistry methodologies, providing evidence of &#960;&#8208;hole Spodium and Regium bonds in Zn2+ and Cu2+ porphyrins, in addition to unveiling the presence of a &#960;&#8208;hole for group 9 (Co2+). On the other hand, group 10 (Ni2+) acted as both electron donor and acceptor moiety without showing an electropositive &#960;&#8208;hole. Owing to the underexplored potential of &#960;&#8208;hole interactions in transition metal chemistry, we believe the results reported herein will be useful in supramolecular chemistry, organometallics, and solid&#8208;state chemistry by i) putting under the spotlight the &#960;&#8208;hole chemistry involving first row transition metals and ii) unlocking a new tool to direct the self&#8208;assembly of metalloporphyrins.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative construction of 2D/3D frameworks from 2D aromatics is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Ken Tanaka, Yuki Nagashima et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403461). The cover mage shows transformations from 2D quinolines into triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D rings through nucleophilic addition, borate complex formation, and photocycloaddition. Mechanistic studies revealed that the borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state.

         <title>Front Cover: Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion into a Mott&#8211;Hubbard system emerges as an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical materials. In their Research Article (e202406941), Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Huang employ lattice distortion to provide two distinct transition pathways with varying probabilities, while the Mott&#8211;Hubbard configuration ensures the transition sequence. This synergistic design unveils the excited&#8208;state absorption in (MA)2CuX4, enabling these materials to simultaneously exhibit a large nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth.

         <title>Back Cover: Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method was developed to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. To mimic the lipid environment in synapses, model vesicles and a modified lipid layer were confined within a nanopipette, as reported by Ru&#8208;Jia Yu, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202406677). Characteristic ionic current oscillations were recorded and could be used to evaluate the binding affinity of tau protein, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

         <title>Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;Valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional assembles were successfully obtained from spherical polyoxometalates and multinuclear platinum complexes. Each assemble has mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states and unpaired electrons on metal d orbitals, showing semiconducting behaviours, which was 105 times greater than that of the parent polyoxometalates.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanosized molecular metal oxide anion clusters with tuneable structures and functionalities, and they exhibit a redox chemistry and catalytic activity in multielectron redox processes. These are typically poor electrical conductors (&lt;10&#8722;10&#8201;Scm&#8722;1), which is attributed to negligible electronic interactions among anions in the solid state. Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed&#8208;valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin&#8208;type or Dawson&#8208;type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/non&#8208;magnetic Cobalt&#8208;based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/non&#8208;magnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8208;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering the Site Distance of Atomic Cu&#8208;Cu Pairs by First&#8208;Shell Halogen Coordination Boosts CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8208;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first&#8208;shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu (Cu&#8208;I&#8208;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu dual site is accelerated to C2H4 generation and short&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu (Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cu) dual site is beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C&#8208;C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent electrochemical property to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenolysis of haloboranes: from synthesis of hydroboranes to formal hydroboration reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroboranes are versatile reagents in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we report a new method for the preparation of hydroboranes from hydrogen and the corresponding haloboranes. Triethylamine (NEt3) form with dialkylchloroboranes a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H2 and afford the desired hydroborane with ammonium salts. Unreactive haloboranes were unlocked using a catalytic amount of Cy2BCl, enabling the synthesis of commonly used hydroboranes such as pinacolborane or catecholborane. The mechanisms of these reactions have been examined by DFT studies, highlighting the importance of the base selection. Finally, the system's robustness has been evaluated in one&#8208;pot B&#8208;Cl hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Reliable Operation of All&#8208;Climate 4.8 V Li||NCM811 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes with lithium metal anodes is among the most promising approaches for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. However, most current electrolytes fail to simultaneously satisfy the compatibility requirements for the lithium metal anode and the tolerance for the ultra&#8208;high voltage NCM811 cathode. Here, we have designed an ultra&#8208;oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte by meticulously adjusting the composition of fluorinated carbonates. Our study reveals that a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in LiF and Li2O is constructed on the lithium anode through the synergistic decomposition of the fluorinated solvents and PF6&#8208; anion, facilitating smooth lithium metal deposition. The superior oxidation resistance of our electrolyte enables the Li||NCM811 cell to deliver a capacity retention of 80% after 300 cycles at an ultrahigh cut&#8722;off voltage of 4.8 V. Additionally, a pioneering 4.8 V&#8208;class lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 462.2 Wh kg&#8208;1 stably cycles for 110 cycles under harsh conditions of high cathode loading (30 mg cm&#8208;2), low N/P ratio (1.18), and lean electrolytes (2.3 g Ah&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Fused Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates with Tailorable Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new clear&#8208;cut strategy for fusing N&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;pure systems is introduced en route to a versatile platform of multi&#8208;purpose tetrapyrrolic chromophores. In particular, three novel C&#8211;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates were synthesized under oxidative cyclodehydrogenation conditions, starting from tailor&#8208;made nickel porphyrin precursors. The fusion of the individual aromatic systems via 5&#8208;membered rings led to highly soluble &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins in excellent yields. The resulting porphyrin&#8208;HBC conjugates exhibit absorption cross&#8208;sections that are of interdisciplinary interest in the ever&#8208;growing field of organic photovoltaics and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the newly formed 5&#8208;membered rings induce biradicaloid character in the porphyrin core, which has a strong impact on excited state lifetimes. This is confirmed by a thorough optoelectronic and time&#8208;resolved characterization in order to understand these unique features better. Broadened absorption characteristics go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with short&#8208;lived excited states with up to six orders of magnitude faster decay rates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Planar chiral skeletons widely exist in natural products, bioactive compounds, and other functional molecules. Although significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric synthesis of central or axial chiral molecules over the past years, enantioselective constructing of planar chirality is still a big obstacle and numerous efforts have been made in this field. Previous works have mainly focused on the assembly of planar chiral [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes and metallocenes. This Minireview describes the recent advancements on asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar chiral macrocycles, including ansa chain construction, plane formation and asymmetric transformation strategies. It is anticipated that this Minireview will sever as a source of inspiration for developing new unconventional procedures for access to planar chiral skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Redox&#8208;active Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;based Memristors for&#160;Highly&#8208;efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic memristors based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant potential for future neuromorphic computing applications. The preparation of high&#8208;quality COF nanosheets through appropriate structural design and building block selection is critical for the enhancement of memristor performance. In this study, a novel room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method was used to synthesize Ta&#8208;Cu3 COF, which contains two redox&#8208;active units: trinuclear copper and triphenylamine. The resultant COF nanosheets were dispersed through acid&#8208;assisted exfoliation and subsequently spin&#8208;coated to fabricate a high&#8208;quality COF film on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The synergistic effect of the dual redox&#8208;active centers in the COF film, combined with its distinct crystallinity, significantly reduces the redox energy barrier, enabling the efficient modulation of 128 non&#8208;volatile conductive states in the Al/Ta&#8208;Cu3 COF/ITO memristor. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on these 128 conductance states, image recognition for ten representative campus landmarks was successfully executed, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.13% after 25 training epochs. Compared to devices based on binary conductance states, the memristor with 128 conductance states exhibits a 45.56% improvement in recognition accuracy and significantly enhances the efficiency of neuromorphic computing.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;On&#8208;Line&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive.&#160;&#160;&#160;Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid sidechain required for biological activity. Here, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with 6 asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0&#160;and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermotropic &#8220;Plumber&#8217;s Nightmare&#8221; &#8208; A Tight Liquid Organic Double Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gyroid, double diamond and the body&#8208;centred &#8220;Plumber&#8217;s nightmare&#8221; are the three most common bicontinuous cubic phases in lyotropic liquid crystals and block copolymers. While the first two are also present in solvent&#8208;free thermotropics, the latter had never been found. Containing six&#8208;fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod&#8208;like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side&#8208;branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side&#8208;chains should be very short. The true Plumber&#8217;s nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod&#8208;like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end&#8208;chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework&#8208;forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry&#8208;based explanation is given.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Scaling Relations in Ammonia Synthesis through a Light&#8208;driven Bendable Seesaw Effect on Tailored Iron Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process faces significant challenges due to the intrinsic constraints of scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we reported an approach of bending the &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; to regulate the scaling relations over a tailored &#945;&#8208;Fe metallic material (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s), realizing highly efficient light&#8208;driven thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis rate of 1260 &#956;mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without additional heating. Specifically, the thermal catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was significantly enhanced by the novel stepped {110} surface, exhibiting a 3.8&#8208;fold increase compared to the commercial fused&#8208;iron catalyst with promoters at 350 &#176;C. The photo&#8208;induced hot electron transfer further accelerates the dinitrogen dissociation and hydrogenation simultaneously, effectively overcoming the limitation of scaling relation over identical sites. Consequently, the ammonia production rate of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was further enhanced by 30 times at the same temperature with irradiation. This work designs an efficient and sustainable system for ammonia synthesis and provides a novel&#160;approach for regulating the scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization for Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rapid in situ synthesis of electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (EC&#8208;COFs) was proposed by using green electrochemical interface polymerization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;aminophenyl)p&#8208;phenylenediamine (TPDA) and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;p&#8208;phenylenedicarboxaldehyde (DHBD). The synthetized TPDA&#8208;DHBD films exhibit stable polymorphic colour variations under different applied potentials, which can be attributed to the redox state changes of bis(triphenylamine) and imine electroactive functional groups within the COFs skeleton. TPDA&#8208;DHBD represents markedly different electrochromisms from red to cyan due to the steric hindrance effect caused by the presence of UO22+, demonstrating the unique tunability of COFs materials. This work offers a new feasible idea for rapid EC&#8208;COFs synthesis and tunable EC&#8208;COFs realization.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation and hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, enabling highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams in good yields. The mild reaction conditions allow use of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes bearing a variety of functional groups.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Silylalkylamines and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines are versatile synthetic intermediates and attractive scaffolds found in pharmaceutical drugs and agrochemicals. Despite great progress on synthetic methods for preparation of &#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines or &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines, there are no general strategies for preparation of &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines and the reactivity has not been explored. Here we report deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines. The silicon and boron groups in &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines are found to be utilized to chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation. This protocol serves various &#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines from readily available amides.</dc:description>

Despite great progress on synthetic methods for preparation of &#945;-silylalkylamines or &#945;-borylalkylamines, there are no general strategies for preparation of &#945;-boryl-&#945;-silylalkylamines and the reactivity has not been explored. Here we report deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;-boryl-&#945;-silylalkylamines. The silicon and boron groups in &#945;-boryl-&#945;-silylalkylamines are found to be utilized to chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation. This protocol serves various &#945;-silylalkylamines and &#945;-borylalkylamines from readily available amides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium(0) and Br&#248;nsted Acid Co&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective Hydro&#8208;Cyclization of 2,4&#8208;Dienyl Hydrazones and Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydro&#8208;functionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has been well explored, but most reactions focus on electron&#8208;neutral substrates in an intermolecular manner. Here we first demonstrate that readily available 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes can be efficiently utilized in the hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction under co&#8208;catalysis of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a chiral palladium complex, furnishing multifunctional dihydropyrazones and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively. Diverse substitution patterns for both types of electron&#8208;deficient diene compounds are tolerated, and corresponding heterocycles were generally constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to access products with higher molecular complexity and diversity. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations support that &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation of dienyl substrates by acid and concurrent &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation of Pd0 complex is energetically favoured in the formation of active &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates, and an outer&#8208;sphere allylic amination or etherification mode is adopted to deliver the observed cyclized products enantioselectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bioinspired semisynthesis of human&#8208;interleukin&#8208;6 bearing N&#8208;glycan at Asn143 (143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6) was performed by intentional glycosylation effects and protein folding chemistry for regioselective peptide&#8208;backbone activation. 143Glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 is a genetically coded cytokine, but isolation was difficult owing to a tiny amount. IL6&#8208;polypeptide (1&#8208;141&#8208;position) with an intentionally inserted cysteine at 142&#8208;position was expressed in E. coli. The expressed polypeptide was treated with a chemical folding process to make a specific helices bundle conformation through native two&#8208;disulfide bonds (43&#8211;49 and 72&#8211;82). Utilizing the successfully formed free&#8208;142&#8208;cysteine, sequential conversions using cyanation of 142&#8208;cysteine, hydrazinolysis, and thioesterification created a long polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester. However, the resultant polypeptide&#8208;thioester caused considerable aggregation owing to a highly hydrophobic peptide sequence. After the reduction of two&#8208;disulfide bonds of polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester, an unprecedented hydrophilic N&#8208;glycan tag was inserted at the resultant cysteine thiols. The N&#8208;glycan tags greatly stabilized polypeptide&#8208;thioester. The subsequent native chemical ligation and desulfurization successfully gave a whole 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 polypeptide (183&#8208;amino acids). Removal of four N&#8208;glycan tags and immediate one&#8208;pot in vitro folding protocol efficiently produced the folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6. The folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 exhibited potent cell proliferation activity. The combined studies with molecular dynamics simulation, semisynthesis, and bioassays predict the bioactive conformation of latent 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW ~ 2000 Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500 &#8208; 1000 Pa) but unique thermal viscoelastic response. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing elasticity with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One&#8208;step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purification of C2H4 from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C2H6 and C2H2. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture because of the low C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C2H6 and C2H2 preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF&#8208;TDCPB can not only obtain high&#8208;purity C2H4 from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture, with the C2H4 productivity of 3.2 L/kg (&gt;99.999%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF&#8208;TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high&#8208;humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C2H2, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Decorated Rhodium Nanoparticles Incorporated in Covalent Organic Framework for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While metal nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated their great potential in catalysis, introducing chiral microenvironment around metal NPs to achieve efficient conversion and high enantioselectivity remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this work, tiny Rh NPs, modified by chiral diene ligands (Lx) bearing diverse functional groups, are incorporated into a covalent organic framework (COF) for the asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. Though Rh NPs hosted in the COF are inactive, decorating Rh NPs with Lx creates the active Rh&#8208;Lx interface and induces high activity. Moreover, chiral microenvironment modulation around Rh NPs by altering the groups on chiral diene ligands greatly optimizes the enantioselectivity (up to 95.6% ee). Mechanistic investigations indicate that the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between Lx and nitroalkenes plays critical roles in the resulting enantioselectivity. This work highlights the significance of chiral microenvironment modulation around metal NPs by chiral ligand decoration for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for Highly Specific Bioorthogonal Catalysis inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells. Our studies reveal that the Cu-MIEs act as highly specific guides, precisely catalyzing target substrates, even in glutathione (GSH)-rich cellular environments. By adapting templates similar to the target substrates, we evolved Cu-MIEs activity to a high level and provided a method to broaden its scope to other unique substrates. This system was applied to a thyroid hormone (T3)-responsive gene switch model, inducing firefly luciferase expression by T3 in cells. This approach verifies that MIEs effectively rescue DmProc-bearing T3 prodrugs and seamlessly integrating themself into cellular biocatalytic networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Modification of the Buried Interface in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells can reach bandgaps as low as 1.2&#160;eV, offering high theoretical efficiency and serving as base materials for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, instability and high defect densities&#160;at the interfaces, particularly the buried surface,&#160;have limited performance improvements. In this work, we present the modification of the bottom perovskite interface with multifunctional hydroxylamine salts. These salts can effectively coordinate the different perovskite components, having critical influences in regulating the crystallization process and passivating defects of varying nature. The surface modification reduced traps at the interface and prevented the formation of excessive lead iodide, enhancing the quality of the films. The modified devices presented fill factors reaching 81% and efficiencies of up to 23.8%. The unencapsulated modified devices maintained over 95% of their initial efficiency after 2000 h of shelf storage.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid Orbitrap&#8208;Nanoelectromechanical Systems Approach for the Analysis of Individual, Intact Proteins in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectromechanical systems&#8208;based mass spectrometry (NEMS&#8208;MS) determines the mass of individual particles by monitoring resonance frequency changes in tiny mechanical devices. Incorporating NEMS into an Orbitrap instrument enhances the dynamic range and enables deep proteomic analysis. This work measures E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules, showing good agreement with the known mass.







Abstract
Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)&#8208;based mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging technique that enables determination of the mass of individual adsorbed particles by driving nanomechanical devices at resonance and monitoring the real&#8208;time changes in their resonance frequencies induced by each single molecule adsorption event. We incorporate NEMS into an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and report our progress towards leveraging the single&#8208;molecule capabilities of the NEMS to enhance the dynamic range of conventional MS instrumentation and to offer new capabilities for performing deep proteomic analysis of clinically relevant samples. We use the hybrid instrument to deliver E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules (801&#8197;kDa) to the NEMS devices in their native, intact state. Custom ion optics are used to focus the beam down to 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter with a maximum flux of 25&#8197;molecules/second. The mass spectrum obtained with NEMS&#8208;MS shows good agreement with the known mass of GroEL.

         <title>Precise Helium Sieving from Hydrogen Using Fluorine&#8208;Decorated Carbon Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fiber membranes enables the tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities.







Abstract
Separating helium (He) and hydrogen (H2), two gases that are extremely similar in molecular size and condensation properties, presents a formidable challenge in the helium industry. The development of membranes capable of precisely differentiating between these gases is crucial for achieving large&#8208;scale, energy&#8208;efficient He/H2 separation. However, the limited selectivity of current membranes has hindered their practical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by engineering submicroporous membranes through the fluorination of partially carbonized hollow fibers. We demonstrate that the fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fibers enables tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The fluorinated HFM&#8208;550&#8208;F&#8208;1&#8197;min membrane exhibits exceptional mixed&#8208;gas separation performance, with a binary mixed&#8208;gas He/H2 selectivity of 10.5 and a ternary mixed&#8208;gas He/(H2+CO2) selectivity of 20.8, at 40&#8197;bar feed pressure and 35&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing all previously reported polymer&#8208;based gas separation membranes, and remarkable plasticization resistance and long&#8208;term continuous stability over 30&#8197;days.

         <dc:description>
A mild and highly selective decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling diborylmethylation of various alkyl carboxylic acids with a gem&#8208;diboryl metallic reagent has been accomplished via dual photoredox/copper catalysis providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176;&#8201;&#946; positions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes are highly valuable building blocks in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry due to their ability to participate in multi&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling transformations, allowing for the rapid generation of molecular complexity. While progress has been made in their synthetic metholodology, the construction of &#946;&#8208;tertiary and C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes remains a synthetic challenge due to substrate limitations and steric hindrance issues. An approach is presented that utilizes synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis to achieve efficient C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, which can easily be obtained from alkyl carboxylic acids, with diborylmethyl species, providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176; &#946; positions. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to complex medicinal compounds and natural products, offering rapid access to molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;rich drug candidates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that diborylmethyl Cu(I) species participated in both the photoredox process and the key C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming step.

A novel hole&#8208;transporting material [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) is synthesized by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) at carbazolyl unit, which facilitates the spreading of perovskite, has well matching energy band with perovskite, suppresses defects and releases residual stress at buried interface of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Consequently, GM&#8208;4PACz&#8208;based IPSCs engender a high efficiency of 25.52&#8201;% and an excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled molecules (OSAMs) based hole&#8208;transporting materials play a pivotal role in achieving highly efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, the reported carbazol&#8208;based OSAMs have serious drawbacks, such as poor wettability for perovskite solution spreading due to the nonpolar surface, worse matched energy arrangement with perovskite, and limited molecular species, which greatly limit the device performance. To address above problems, a novel OSAM [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) was synthesized as hole&#8208;transporting material by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) side chains at carbazolyl unit. GM groups enhance the surface energy of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/SAM substrate to facilitate the nucleation and growth of up perovskite film, suppress cation defects, release the residual stress at SAM/perovskite interface, and evaluate energy level for matching with perovskite. Consequently, the GM&#8208;4PACz based IPSC achieves a champion PCE of 25.52&#8201;%, a respectable open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.21&#8197;V, a high stability, possessing 93.29&#8201;% and 91.75&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 2000&#8197;h or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>Hyperpolarization of 15N&#8208;Pyridinium by Using Parahydrogen Enables Access to Reactive Oxygen Sensors and Pilot In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>

A 15N&#8208;labelled tracer for magnetic resonance is introduced that is signal enhanced using parahydrogen and the feasibility for first pilot 15N in vivo studies is demonstrated.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance with hyperpolarized contrast agents is one of the most powerful and noninvasive imaging platforms capable for investigating in vivo metabolism. While most of the utilized hyperpolarized agents are based on 13C nuclei, a milestone advance in this area is the emergence of 15N hyperpolarized contrast agents. Currently, the reported 15N hyperpolarized agents mainly utilize the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) protocol. The parahydrogen enhanced 15N probes have proven to be elusive and have been tested almost exclusively in organic solvents. Herein, we designed a reaction based reactive oxygen sensor 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) which can be hyperpolarized with para&#8208;hydrogen. Reactive oxygen species plays a vital role as one of the essential intracellular signalling molecules. Disturbance of the H2O2 level usually represents a hallmark of pathophysiological conditions. This H2O2 probe exhibited rapid responsiveness toward H2O2 and offered spectrally resolvable chemical shifts. We also provide strategies to bring the newly developed probe from the organic reaction solution into a biocompatible injection buffer and demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo 15N signal detection. The present work manifests its great potential not only for reaction based reactive sensing probes but also promises to serve as a platform to develop other contrast agents.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dynamic Activation of Copper/Silicon Interface for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedentedly reveals the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu/BSi interface during photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, which was validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by a light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. The adaptive junction is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.







Abstract
Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially the possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined facets on black p&#8208;type silicon (BSi) is unprecedentedly demonstrated to reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal&#8208;BSi interface during photoelectrocatalysis, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu&#8722;Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance for CO2 electroreduction, which efficiently restricts the C&#8722;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products and an intriguing selectivity switch. This work offers new insights into dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction and design of highly efficient catalysts toward photosynthesis.

         <title>Construction of Benzoxazine&#8208;linked One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks Using the Mannich Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline 1D benzoxazine&#8208;linked covalent organic polymers have been successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot Mannich reaction. The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques.







Abstract
Covalent polymerization of organic molecules into crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polymers is effective for achieving desired thermal, optical, and electrical properties, yet it remains a persistent synthetic challenge for their inherent tendency to adopt amorphous or semicrystalline phases. Here we report a strategy to synthesize crystalline 1D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composing quasi&#8208;conjugated chains with benzoxazine linkages via the one&#8208;pot Mannich reaction. Through [4+2] and [2+2] type Mannich condensation reactions, we fabricated stoichiometric and sub&#8208;stoichiometric 1D covalent polymeric chains, respectively, using doubly and singly linked benzoxazine rings. The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalizations of them with a chiral MacMillan catalyst produce crystalline organic photocatalysts that demonstrated excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in light&#8208;driven asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes, affording up to 94&#8201;% enantiomeric excess

         <title>Constructing An Oxyhalide Interface for 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;Tolerant High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high voltage stable uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) is synthesized via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Compared with conventional coating, this oxyhalide coating exhibits high ionic conductivity and excellent high voltage stability. Therefore, the interfacial side reactions between NCM811 and sulfide solid electrolytes can be effectively suppressed even at high voltage, thus the interfacial products can be well abridged.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) have received increasing attentions as one promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Among various solid electrolytes, sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs combined with layered oxide cathodes have emerged due to the high energy density and safety performance, even at high&#8208;voltage conditions. However, the interface compatibility issues remain to be solved at the interface between the oxide cathode and sulfide electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;A high voltage stable uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811) is synthesized via a controllable gas-solid reaction. Compared with conventional coating, this oxyhalide coating exhibits high ionic conductivity and excellent high voltage stability. Therefore, the interfacial side reactions between NCM811 and sulfide solid electrolytes can be effectively suppressed even at high voltage, thus the interfacial products can be well abridged.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSBs) have received increasing attentions as one promising candidate for the next-generation energy storage devices. Among various solid electrolytes, sulfide-based ASSBs combined with layered oxide cathodes have emerged due to the high energy density and safety performance, even at high-voltage conditions.

         <title>Umpolung&#8208;Enabled Divergent Dearomative Carbonylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dearomative carbonylation mode involving sequential nucleophile/nucleophile addition across benzene &#960;&#8208;bonds enables the divergent synthesis of esters and amides by tolerating a broad spectrum of benzene derivatives, nucleophilic partners, alcohols, and amines. The versatility of the process further allows for the tunable synthesis of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes and the construction of quaternary carbon centers.







Abstract
Although dearomative functionalizations enable the direct conversion of flat aromatics into precious three&#8208;dimensional architectures, the case for simple arenes remains largely underdeveloped owing to the high aromatic stabilization energy. We herein report a dearomative sequential addition of two nucleophiles to arene &#960;&#8208;bonds through umpolung of chromium&#8211;arene complexes. This mode enables divergent dearomative carbonylation reactions of benzene derivatives by tolerating various nucleophiles in combination with alcohols or amines under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, thus providing modular access to functionalized esters or amides. The tunable synthesis of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes as well as the construction of carbon quaternary centers further highlight the versatility of this dearomatization. Diverse late&#8208;stage modifications and derivatizations towards synthetically challenging and bioactive molecules reveal the synthetic utility. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments and intermediate tracking.

         <title>Expedited Synthesis of Metal Phosphides Maximizes Dispersion, Air Stability, and Catalytic Performance in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis based on cheap and safe precursors delivers a wide range of supported metal phosphides with small particle diameters and high dispersion. Ni2P/Al2O3 prepared in this fashion is a bench&#8208;stable catalyst that delivers activity on par with the Pd&#8208;based benchmark catalyst in alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal phosphides have been hailed as potential replacements for scarce noble metal catalysts in many aspects of the hydrogen economy from hydrogen evolution to selective hydrogenation reactions. But the need for dangerous and costly phosphorus precursors, limited support dispersion, and low stability of the metal phosphide surface toward oxidation substantially lower the appeal and performance of metal phosphides in catalysis. We show here that a 1&#8208;step procedure that relies on safe and cheap precursors can furnish an air&#8208;stable Ni2P/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3.2&#8197;nm nanoparticles. Ni2P/Al2O3&#8201;1&#8208;step is kinetically competitive with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst in selective hydrogenation catalysis, and a loading corresponding to 4&#8197;ppm Ni was sufficient to convert 0.1&#8197;mol alkyne. The 1&#8208;step synthetic procedure alters the surface ligand speciation of Ni2P/Al2O3, which protects the nanoparticle surface from oxidation, and ensures that 85&#8201;% of the initial catalytic activity was retained after the catalyst was stored under air for 1.5&#8197;years. Preparation of Ni2P on a variety of supports (silica, TiO2, SBA&#8208;15, ZrO2, C and HAP) as well as Co2P/Al2O3, Co2P/TiO2 and bimetallic NiCoP/TiO2 demonstrates the generality with which supported metal phosphides can be accessed in a safe and straightforward fashion with small sizes and high dispersion.

         <title>Oxide&#8208;Encapsulated Silver Electrocatalysts for Selective and Stable Syngas Production from Reactive Carbon Capture Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a simple yet effect strategy to enhance CO selectivity and electrode stability using a titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayer and a chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA). This strategy is ideally suited for the direct electrolysis of reactive CO2 capture solution towards carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production.







Abstract
Electrolysis of bicarbonate&#8208;containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low&#8208;cost carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate&#8208;mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50&#8201;% at potentials more negative than &#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33&#8201;% (relative). In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near&#8208;surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5&#8197;ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with &gt;47&#8201;% FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in &#8220;open&#8221; carbon capture systems.

         <title>Tailoring d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization to Decipher the Essential Effects of Heteroatom Substitution on Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The moderate&#8208;concentration Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 simultaneously with suitable Se vacancies adsorbing OH&#8722; (Co(M)&#8722;Ni3Se4(VM)&#8722;OH&#8722;) presents optimal d&#8211;p orbital hybridization, substantially deciphering the effects of Co atoms substitution on the fast redox kinetics and ultrahigh rate capability of Ni3Se4 cathodes.







Abstract
The heteroatom substitution is considered as a promising strategy for boosting the redox kinetics of transition metal compounds in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) although the dissimilar metal identification and essential mechanism that dominate the kinetics remain unclear. It is presented that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the metal and electrolyte ions can be utilized as a descriptor for understanding the redox kinetics. Herein, a series of Co, Fe and Cu heteroatoms are respectively introduced into Ni3Se4 cathodes, among them, only the moderate Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 can hold the optimal d&#8208;p orbital hybridization resulted from the formed more unoccupied antibonding states &#960;*. It inevitably enhances the interfacial charge transfer and ensures the balanced OH&#8722; adsorption&#8208;desorption to accelerate the redox kinetics validated by the lowest reaction barrier (0.59&#8197;eV, matching well with the theoretical calculations). Coupling with the lower OH&#8722; diffusion energy barrier, the prepared cathode delivers ultrahigh rate capability (~68.7&#8201;% capacity retention even the current density increases by 200&#8197;times), and an assembled HSC also presents high energy/power density.

&lt;p&gt;The moderate-concentration Co-substituted Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously with suitable Se vacancies adsorbing OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (Co&lt;sub&gt;(M)&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(VM)&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) presents optimal d&#8211;p orbital hybridization, substantially deciphering the effects of Co atoms substitution on the fast redox kinetics and ultrahigh rate capability of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heteroatom substitution is considered as a promising strategy for boosting the redox kinetics of transition metal compounds in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) although the dissimilar metal identification and essential mechanism that dominate the kinetics remain unclear. It is presented that d-p orbital hybridization between the metal and electrolyte ions can be utilized as a descriptor for understanding the redox kinetics. Herein, a series of Co, Fe and Cu heteroatoms are respectively introduced into Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes, among them, only the moderate Co-substituted Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can hold the optimal d-p orbital hybridization resulted from the formed more unoccupied antibonding states &#960;*. It inevitably enhances the interfacial charge transfer and ensures the balanced OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption-desorption to accelerate the redox kinetics validated by the lowest reaction barrier (0.59&#8197;eV, matching well with the theoretical calculations). Coupling with the lower OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion energy barrier, the prepared cathode delivers ultrahigh rate capability (~68.7&#8201;% capacity retention even the current density increases by 200&#8197;times), and an assembled HSC also presents high energy/power density. This work establishes the principles for determining heteroatoms and deciphers the underlying effects of the heteroatom substitution on improving redox kinetics and the rate performance of battery-type electrodes from a novel perspective of orbital-scale manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unusual Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity in Oxidation of Pyrroles and Indoles Enabled by a Thianthrenium Salt Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
TTSO (thianthrene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide) in conjunction with TFAA (trifluoroacetic anhydride) and Br&#248;nsted acid is able to oxidize pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones and indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones via a thianthrenium salt intermediate. In the case of 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles, the product isomer formed is that in which oxygenation has been introduced at the more sterically hindered position.







Abstract
A dearomative oxidation of pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones is described, which employs a sulfoxide as oxidant, in conjunction with a carboxylic acid anhydride and a Br&#248;nsted acid additive. 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles undergo regioselective oxidation to give the product isomer in which oxygen has been introduced at the more hindered position. Regioselectivity is rationalized by a proposed mechanism that proceeds by initial thianthrenium introduction at the less&#8208;hindered pyrrole &#945;&#8208;position, followed by distal attack of an oxygen nucleophile and subsequent elimination of thianthrene. The same reaction conditions are also able to effect a chemoselective oxidation of indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and additionally of indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones to 2&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. Here again, the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities are rationalized through the intermediacy of a thianthrenium salt.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Oxidation of Alcohols in Gold&#8208;Coated Milling Vessels via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovating in selective alcohol oxidation, our study unveils a gold&#8208;catalyzed direct mechanocatalytic approach, boasting &gt;95&#8201;% aldehyde conversion with &lt;0.3&#8201;% overoxidation and minimal gold abrasion. Optimized parameters ensure efficiency and sustainability across alcohols, with high catalyst reusability. XPS surface analysis of the gold milling balls highlight the oxidation mechanism and its potential in green chemistry.







Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for the selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes through direct mechanocatalysis, employing a gold&#8208;coated milling vessel as catalyst and air as the oxidation agent. By adjusting milling frequency, media, and duration, high catalytic efficiencies and selectivities are achieved. Remarkably, yields of up to 99&#8201;% are obtained for specific substrates, with a turnover number (TON) of 8200 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.77&#8197;s&#8722;1, surpassing existing alternatives. Confirmation of the catalytic reaction indeed occurring on the milling tool surface was achieved through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Alkyne&#8208;Based Conjugated Porous Polymers with Skeleton Distortion&#8208;Mediated &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 Generation for High&#8208;Selectivity Organic Photosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of pyrene&#8208;alkyne&#8208;based conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) with different skeleton torsion&#8208;angles have been rationally prepared, which exhibits significant differences in its exciton behavior, reactive oxygen species, photocatalytic activity, and mechanisms. It provides a valuable reference and inspiration for the rational design of novel, high&#8208;efficiency, and high&#8208;selectivity CPPs photocatalysts.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in determining photocatalytic reaction pathways, intermediate species, and product selectivity. However, research on ROS regulation in polymer photocatalysts is still in its early stages. Herein, we successfully achieved series of modulations to the skeleton of Pyrene&#8208;alkyne&#8208;based (Tetraethynylpyrene (TEPY)) conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) by altering the linkers (1,4&#8208;dibromobenzene (BE), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (IP), and 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (BP)). Experiments combined with theoretical calculations indicate that BE&#8208;TEPY exhibits a planar structure with minimal exciton binding energy, which favors exciton dissociation followed by charge transfer with adsorbed O2 to produce &#8901;O2&#8722;. Thus BE&#8208;TEPY shows optimal photocatalytic activity for phenylboronic acid oxidation and [3+2] cycloaddition. Conversely, the skeleton of BP&#8208;TEPY is significantly distorted. Its planar conjugation decreases, intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency increases, which makes it more prone for resonance energy transfer to generate 1O2. Therefore, BP&#8208;TEPY displays best photocatalytic activity in [4+2] cycloaddition and thioanisole oxidation. Both above reactant conversion and its product selectivity exceed 99&#8201;%. This work systematically reveals the intrinsic structure&#8211;activity relationship among the skeleton structure of CPPs, excitonic behavior, and selective generation of ROS, providing new insights for the rational design of highly efficient and selective CPPs photocatalysts.

         <title>Role of Cu Oxide and Cu Adatoms in the Reactivity of CO2 on Cu(110)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With in situ near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the CuO/Cu(110) interface reacts with CO2 at room temperature, yielding the formation of Cu adatom&#8208;CO3 complexes. The reaction&#8208;induced surface structure resulting from CO2 exposes Cu adatoms and CuO segments as potential active sites on Cu(110), whose presence favor CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over sites on the bare Cu surface.







Abstract
We investigate the interaction of CO2 with metallic and oxidized Cu(110) surfaces using a combination of near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and theoretical calculations. While the Cu(110) and full CuO films are inert, the interface between bare Cu(110) and the CuO film is observed to react instantly with CO2 at a 10&#8197;mbar pressure. The reaction is observed to proceed from the interfacial sites of CuO/Cu(110). During reaction with CO2, the CuO/Cu(110) interface releases Cu adatoms which combine with CO3 to produce a variety of added Cu&#8722;CO3 structures, whose stability depends on the gas pressure of CO2. A main implication for the reactivity of Cu(110) is that Cu adatoms and highly undercoordinated CuO segments are created on the Cu(110) surface through the interaction with CO2, which may act as reaction&#8208;induced active sites. In the case of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, our theoretical assessment of such sites indicates that their presence may significantly promote CH3OH formation. Our study thus implies that the CuO/Cu(110) interfacial system is highly dynamic in the presence of CO2, and it suggests a possible strong importance of reaction&#8208;induced Cu and CuO sites for the surface chemistry of Cu(110) in CO2&#8208;related catalysis.

During reaction with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the CuO/Cu(110) interface releases Cu adatoms which combine with CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to produce a variety of added Cu&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structures, whose stability depends on the gas pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A main implication for the reactivity of Cu(110) is that Cu adatoms and highly undercoordinated CuO segments are created on the Cu(110) surface through the interaction with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which may act as reaction-induced active sites. In the case of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to methanol, our theoretical assessment of such sites indicates that their presence may significantly promote CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH formation. Our study thus implies that the CuO/Cu(110) interfacial system is highly dynamic in the presence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and it suggests a possible strong importance of reaction-induced Cu and CuO sites for the surface chemistry of Cu(110) in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-related catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merged Molecular Switches Excel as Optoacoustic Dyes: Azobenzene&#8211;Cyanines Are Loud and Photostable NIR Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic dyes used in photoacoustic imaging are often photobleachable and hard to quantify as they respond nonlinearly to excitation intensity. However, a systematic method that uses molecular switches to shorten their nonradiative decay times to 4&#8197;ps converts them into reliably quantifiable linear absorbers that are up to &gt;1000&#8208;fold more photostable and several times better signal generators in photoacoustic imaging.







Abstract
Optoacoustic (or photoacoustic) imaging promises micron&#8208;resolution noninvasive bioimaging with much deeper penetration (&gt;cm) than fluorescence. However, optoacoustic imaging of enzyme activity would require loud, photostable, NIR&#8208;absorbing molecular contrast agents, which remain unknown. Most organic molecular contrast agents are repurposed fluorophores, with severe shortcomings of photoinstability or phototoxicity under optoacoustic imaging, as consequences of their slow S1&#8594;S0 electronic relaxation. We now report that known fluorophores can be rationally modified to reach ultrafast S1&#8594;S0 rates, without much extra molecular complexity, simply by merging them with molecular switches. Here, we merge azobenzene switches with cyanine dyes to give ultrafast relaxation (&lt;10&#8197;ps, &gt;100&#8208;fold faster). Without even adapting instrument settings, these azohemicyanines display outstanding improvements in signal longevity (&gt;1000&#8208;fold increase of photostability) and signal loudness (&gt;3&#8208;fold even at time zero). We show why this simple but unexplored design strategy can still offer stronger performance in the future, and can also increase the spatial resolution and the quantitative linearity of photoacoustic response over extended longitudinal imaging. By bringing the world of molecular switches and rotors to bear on problems facing optoacoustic agents, this practical strategy will help to unleash the full potential of optoacoustic imaging in fundamental studies and translational uses.

         <title>Amorphous MnRuOx Containing Microcrystalline for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal amorphous MnRuOx and RuO2 crystalline heterostructures are critical in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the acidic OER. The microcrystalline regions in the catalyst serve as a supporting framework, while the amorphous phase fills the microcrystalline interstices, thus providing substantial defects and active sites at the interfaces to facilitate efficient adsorption/conversion of OH&#8722; and charge transfer.







Abstract
Compared to Ir, Ru&#8208;based catalysts often exhibited higher activity but suffered significant and rapid activity loss during the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a corrosive acidic environment. Herein, we developed a hybrid MnRuOx catalyst in which the RuO2 microcrystalline regions serve as a supporting framework, and the amorphous MnRuOx phase fills the microcrystalline interstices. In particular, the MnRuOx&#8208;300 catalyst from an annealing temperature of 300&#8201;&#176;C contains an optimal amorphous/crystalline heterostructure, providing substantial defects and active sites, facilitating efficient adsorption and conversion of OH&#8722;. In addition, the heterostructure leads to a relative increase of the d&#8208;band center close to the Fermin level, thus accelerating electron transfer with reduced charge transfer resistance at the active interface between crystalline and amorphous phases during the OER. The catalyst was further thoroughly evaluated under various operating conditions and demonstrated exceptional activity and stability for the OER, representing a promising solution to replace Ir in water electrolyzers.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation through Deep Oxidation of Co4N by Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8211;Active Dopants for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We inserted Mn dopants in Co4N, to promote the formation of high&#8208;valence Co4+ during the pre&#8208;catalyst activation process. The energy barrier of phase transformation from CoOOH to CoO2 was lowered by introducing J&#8211;T active Mn3+ cations, because the violent distortion of the Mn3+ (t32ge1g)&#8208;centered octahedra MnO6 reduces the structural stability, and facilitates the H desorption. The consistent relationship between the J&#8211;T dopants and the deep&#8208;oxidation process is proved, and this concept can be extended to other elements. Moreover, the lattice oxygen in Mn doped CoO2 (Mn&#8208;CoO2) is activated to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the direct formation of oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (

) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn&#8208;doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and online electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8211;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of the catalyst's electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.

         <title>Force Transduction Through Distant Force&#8208;Bearing Regioisomeric Linkages Affects the Mechanochemical Reactivity of Cyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity is important for designing new mechanophores. Besides the core structure of mechanophores, substituents on a mechanophore can affect its mechanochemical reactivity through electronic stabilization of the intermediate or effectiveness of force transduction from the polymer backbone to the mechanophore. The latter factor represents a unique mechanical effect in considering polymer mechanochemistry. Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the p&#8208;position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force&#8208;bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.

Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; isomers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity is important for designing new mechanophores. Besides the core structure of mechanophores, substituents on a mechanophore can affect its mechanochemical reactivity through electronic stabilization of the intermediate or effectiveness of force transduction from the polymer backbone to the mechanophore. The latter factor represents a unique mechanical effect in considering polymer mechanochemistry. Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non-scissile 1,2-diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force-bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chromium Catalyzed Asymmetric Reformatsky Reaction</title>

An unprecedented Cr&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction of aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;chlorinated esters and amides has been developed, providing modular access to valuable chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
This study describes an unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction, enabling the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;&#8208;chlorinated or &#945;&#8208;brominated esters and amides. By employing a chiral chromium/diarylamine bis(oxazoline) catalyst, we achieved relatively broad functional group tolerance. Distinct from known reports, the protocol operates under both classical and photoredox conditions, facilitated by the in situ formation of a nucleophilic chiral chromium intermediate through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism. Preliminary mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, identify the nucleophilic aldehyde addition as the key stereo&#8208;determining step. This approach not only overcomes the limitations of existing Reformatsky reactions but also provides a versatile strategy for accessing complex chiral molecules.

         <title>20.1&#8201;% Certified Efficiency of Planar Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells by Spacer Cation Chain Length Engineering of 2D Perovskites</title>

         <dc:description>
A chain&#8208;length engineering of alkylammonium spacer cation is proposed to achieve systematic control of key properties of 2D perovskite in 3D/2D perovskite heterojunctions. The 2D perovskite formed by tetradecylammonium spacer cations realizes the optimal balance between defect passivation, energy level structure, and charge transport. The planar hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells achieve an efficiency of 20.40&#8201;%.







Abstract
The planar triple&#8208;layer hole transport layer (HTL)&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have outstanding advantages of low cost and high stability, but are limited by low efficiency. The formation of a 3D/2D heterojunction has been widely proven to enhance device performance. However, the 2D perovskite possesses multiple critical properties associated with 3D perovskite, including defect passivation, energy level, and charge transport properties, all of which can impact device performance. It is challenging to find a powerful means to achieve comprehensive regulation and trade&#8208;off of these key properties. Herein, we propose a chain&#8208;length engineering of alkylammonium spacer cations to achieve this goal. The results show that the 2D perovskite formed by short&#8208;chain alkylammonium cations primarily acts to passivate defects. With the increase in cation chain length, the 2D perovskite achieves a more matched energy level with 3D perovskite, enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and promoting charge separation. However, the further increase in chain length impedes the charge transport due to the insulativity of organic cations. Comprehensively, the 2D perovskite formed by tetradecylammonium cations achieves the optimal balance of defect passivation, interface charge separation, and charge transport. The planar HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs exhibit a new record efficiency of 20.40&#8201;% (certified 20.1&#8201;%).

         <title>Re&#8208;Engineering Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Module Dissection and Duplicated Thiolation Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is presented to dissect fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetases into &#8220;splitting unit&#8221; pairs (SUPs). Collaboration in SUPs is facilitated by artificial duplication of the thiolation domain and its linkers, and an optimized split site. The productivities of SUPs match or exceed those of the corresponding single&#8208;subunit chimeras or even those of native fungal enzymes, boding well for generating novel peptide natural product analogues.







Abstract
Unnatural product (uNP) nonribosomal peptides promise to be a valuable source of pharmacophores for drug discovery. However, the extremely large size and complexity of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes pose formidable challenges to the production of such uNPs by combinatorial biosynthesis and synthetic biology. Here we report a new NRPS dissection strategy that facilitates the engineering and heterologous production of these NRPSs. This strategy divides NRPSs into &#8220;splitting units&#8221;, each forming an enzyme subunit that contains catalytically independent modules. Functional collaboration between the subunits is then facilitated by artificially duplicating, at the N&#8208;terminus of the downstream subunit, the linker &#8208; thiolation domain &#8208; linker fragment that is resident at the C&#8208;terminus of the upstream subunit. Using the suggested split site that follows a conserved motif in the linker connecting the adenylation and the thiolation domains allows cognate or chimeric splitting unit pairs to achieve productivities that match, and in many cases surpass those of hybrid chimeric enzymes, and even those of intact NRPSs, upon production in a heterologous chassis. Our strategy provides facile options for the rational engineering of fungal NRPSs and for the combinatorial reprogramming of nonribosomal peptide production.

         <title>Investigation of the Odilorhabdin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Using NRPS Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the odilorhabdin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was elucidated by engineering of the central non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Therefore, specific modules of the odilorhabdin synthetase were assembled to well&#8208;studied NRPS systems, which resulted in small and non&#8208;toxic NRPS test systems. This method enabled an in vivo investigation of the biosynthesis of targeted NRPS modules and accessory genes of the BGC in E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
The recently identified natural product NOSO&#8208;95A from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO&#8208;502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood. Here we describe the heterologous production of NOSO&#8208;95A in Escherichia coli after refactoring the complete BGC. Since the production titer was low, NRPS engineering was applied to uncover the underlying biosynthetic principles. For this, modules of the odilorhabdin NRPS fused to other synthetases were co&#8208;expressed with candidate hydroxylases encoded in the BGC allowing the characterization of the biosynthesis of three unusual amino acids and leading to the identification of a prodrug&#8208;activation mechanism by deacylation. Our work demonstrates the application of NRPS engineering as a blueprint to mechanistically elucidate large or toxic NRPS and provides the basis to generate novel odilorhabdin analogues with improved properties in the future.

Abstract
Xanthene&#8208;backbone FLPs featuring secondary borane functions &#8722;B(ArX)H (where ArX=C6F5 (ArF) or C6Cl5 (ArCl)) have been targeted through reactions of the dihydroboranes Me2S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BArXH2 with [4,5&#8208;xanth(PR2)Li]2 (R=Ph, iPr), and investigated in the synthesis of related cationic systems via hydride abstraction. The reactivity of these systems (both cationic and charge neutral) with ammonia have been probed, with a view to probing the potential for proton shuttling via N&#8722;H bond &#8216;activation.&#8217; We find that in the case of four&#8208;coordinate boron systems (cationic or change neutral), the N&#8722;H linkage remains intact, supported by a NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P hydrogen bond which is worth up to 17&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 thermodynamically, and enabled by planarization of the flexible xanthene scaffold. For cationic three coordinate systems, N&#8208;to&#8208;P proton transfer is viable, driven by the ability of the boron centre to stabilise the [NH2]&#8722; conjugate base through N&#8208;to&#8208;B &#960; bonding. This proton transfer can be shown to be reversible in the presence of excess ammonia, depending on the nature of the B&#8208;bound ArX group. It is viable in the case of C6F5 substituents, but is prevented by the more sterically encumbering and secondary donor&#8208;stabilising capabilities of the C6Cl5 substituent.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient PEC strategy is developed to produce urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; over a cubic Cu2O photocathode, achieving high formation rate (29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Faraday efficiency (12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;%) of urea. Experimental and theoretical data demonstrate the reaction mechanism, showing the key intermediates and details of C&#8722;N couplings.







Abstract
Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;% at low external potential (&#8722;0.017&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.

         <title>Roles of Ferric Peroxide Anion Intermediates (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) in Cytochrome P450 19A1 Steroid Aromatization and a Cytochrome P450 2B4 Secosteroid Oxidation Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although most cytochrome P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations are believed to utilize perferryl oxygen (Compound I) as a reactive iron species, the ferric peroxide species (Compound 0) is thought to catalyze some oxidative deformylations. This study revealed the dominant contribution of Compound 0 in the P450 19A1&#8208;catalyzed steroid aromatization and P450 2B4&#8208;catalyzed model aromatization reactions, utilizing deuterium and 18O labeling approaches.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) 19A1 is the steroid aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the 3&#8208;step conversion of androgens (androstenedione or testosterone) to estrogens. The final step is C&#8722;C bond scission (removing the 19&#8208;oxo group as formic acid) that proceeds via a historically controversial reaction mechanism. The two competing mechanistic possibilities involve a ferric peroxide anion (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) and a perferryl oxy species (FeO3+, Compound I). One approach to discern the role of each species in the reaction is with the use of oxygen&#8208;18 labeling, i.e., from 18O2 and H218O of the reaction product formic acid. We applied this approach, using several technical improvements, to study the deformylation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione by human P450 19A1 and of a model secosteroid, 3&#8208;oxodecaline&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;10&#8208;carboxaldehyde (ODEC), by rabbit P450 2B4. Both aldehyde substrates were sensitive to non&#8208;enzymatic acid&#8208;catalyzed deformylation, yielding 19&#8208;norsteroids, and conditions were established to avoid issues with artifactual generation of formic acid. The Compound 0 reaction pathway predominated (i.e., Fe3+O2&#8722;) in both P450 19A1 oxidation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione and P450 2B4 oxidation of ODEC. The P450 19A1 results contrast with our prior conclusions (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 15016&#8211;16025), attributed to several technical modifications.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Covalent C=C/C=N Metathesis Reaction for Associative Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the C=C/C=N metathesis reaction, we have successfully incorporated tunable plasticity into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating catalyst&#8208;free and associative covalent adaptable networks with superior thermal and mechanical properties. The rapid exchange of C=C/C=N bonds significantly accelerates stress relaxation, enhancing malleability and enabling recovery under mild conditions. This plasticity also led to advanced shape memory properties with complex 3D permanent shapes.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), leveraging the dynamic exchange of covalent bonds, emerge as a promising material to address the challenge of irreversible cross&#8208;linking in thermosetting polymers. In this work, we explore the introduction of a catalyst&#8208;free and associative C=C/C=N metathesis reaction into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating CANs with superior stability, solvent resistance, and thermal/mechanical properties. By incorporating this dynamic exchange reaction, stress&#8208;relaxation is significantly accelerated compared to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;only networks, with the rate adjustable by modifying substituents in the ortho position of the dynamic double bonds. The obtained plasticity enables recycle without altering the chemical structure or mechanical properties, and is also found to be vital for achieving shape memory functions with complex spatial structures. This metathesis reaction as a new dynamic crosslinker of polymer networks has the potential to accelerate the ongoing exploration of malleable and functional thermoset polymers.

In this work, we explore the introduction of a catalyst-free and associative C=C/C=N metathesis reaction into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating CANs with superior stability, solvent resistance, and thermal/mechanical properties. By incorporating this dynamic exchange reaction, stress-relaxation is significantly accelerated compared to imine-bond-only networks, with the rate adjustable by modifying substituents in the ortho position of the dynamic double bonds. The obtained plasticity enables recycle without altering the chemical structure or mechanical properties, and is also found to be vital for achieving shape memory functions with complex spatial structures. This metathesis reaction as a new dynamic crosslinker of polymer networks has the potential to accelerate the ongoing exploration of malleable and functional thermoset polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymes in Synergy: Bacteria Specific Molecular Probe for Locoregional Imaging of Urinary Tract Infection in vivo</title>

We developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared uropathogenic E. coli (UPECs) peptide fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs via the collaborative response of bacterial enzymes (OmpT and APN), enabling locoregional imaging of urinary tract infections both in vitro and in vivo, opening new avenues for timely and precise UTI diagnosis.







Abstract
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPECs) is a leading cause for urinary tract infections (UTI), accounting for 70&#8211;90&#8201;% of community or hospital&#8208;acquired bacterial infections owing to high recurrence, imprecision in diagnosis and management, and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Current methods for clinical UPECs detection still rely on labor&#8208;intensive urine cultures that impede rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely UTI therapeutic management. Herein, we developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared (NIR) UPECs fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs through its collaborative response to bacterial enzymes, enabling locoregional imaging of UTIs both in vitro and in vivo. Our NO&#8722;AH probe incorporates a dual protease activatable moiety, which first reacts with OmpT, an endopeptidase abundantly present on the outer membrane of UPECs, releasing an intermediate amino acid residue conjugated with a NIR hemicyanine fluorophore. Such liberated fragment would be subsequently recognized by aminopeptidase (APN) within the periplasm of UPECs, activating localized fluorescence for precise imaging of UTIs in complex living environments. The peculiar specificity and selectivity of NO&#8722;AH, facilitated by the collaborative action of bacterial enzymes, features a timely and accurate identification of UPECs&#8208;infected UTIs, which could overcome misdiagnosis in conventional urine tests, thus opening new avenues towards reliable UTI diagnosis and personalized antimicrobial therapy management.

         <title>Biomimetic Charge&#8208;Neutral Anion Receptors for Reversible Binding and Release of Highly Hydrated Phosphate in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic charge&#8208;neutral anion receptor for reversible binding and release of highly hydrated phosphate in water is reported.







Abstract
Control of phosphate capture and release is vital in environmental, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts. However, the binding of trivalent phosphate (PO43&#8722;) in water is exceptionally difficult due to its high hydration energy. Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge&#8208;neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1&#8211;L4), which were equipped with morpholine and polyethylene glycol terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH&#8208;triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43&#8722; anion in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100&#8201;% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100&#8201;% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH&#8208;triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Thiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes occur under silyl catalysis to generate sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts. Conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when optically&#8208;enriched epoxide was used. A desulfurizing transformation provides functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks. DFT calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these cycloadditions.







Abstract
Unexpectedly facile dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy enolsilanes, providing sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts, are reported. A total of fifteen thiophene substrates have been found to undergo (4+3) cycloaddition smoothly to produce endo and exo (4+3) adducts in yields of up to 83&#8201;% with moderate to good diastereoselectivity. Complete conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when the optically enriched epoxide was used. The desulfurizing transformations of the sulfur&#8208;bridged skeleton of the cycloadducts provide functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks consisting of 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadiene subunits. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these (4+3) cycloadditions.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4 Using a Dual&#8208;Sites Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework Coupled with Cu2O Nanoparticles via a Synergetic&#8208;Tandem Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy was developed to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst by dispersing Cu2O nanoparticles on CuPOF&#8208;Bpy@CNT comprising dual active sites for CO2 electroreduction. The synergetic interaction in dual active sites efficiently reduces CO2 to *CO with high concentration, which transferred to the nearby Cu2O sites for *CO dimerization to form *COCOH, affording an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 71&#8201;% for C2H4 production.







Abstract
Low *CO coverage on the active sites is a major hurdle in the tandem electrocatalysis, resulting in unsatisfied C2H4 production efficiencies. In this work, we developed a synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4, which was constructed via the template&#8208;directed polymerization of ultrathin Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework incorporating atomically isolated Cu(II) porphyrin and Cu(II) bipyridine sites on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, and then Cu2O nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the CNT scaffold. The presence of dual active sites within the Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework create a synergetic effect, leading to an increase in local *CO availability to enhance the C&#8722;C coupling step implemented on the adjacent Cu2O nanoparticles for further C2H4 production. Accordingly, the resultant catalyst affords an exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FEC2H4) of 71.0&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), making it one of the most effective copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts reported to date. The superior performance of the catalyst is further confirmed through operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic calculations.

We use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs. The optimized ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions, provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.







Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) can greatly reduce the energy consumption of the separation process, but it is extremely challenging. Herein, we use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds (ethynyl and alkyne) into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne). The introduction of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds provides abundant adsorption sites within the framework while modulating the pore window size. Comprehensive characterization techniques including single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) confirm that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne possess an isostructural framework with ZrT&#8208;1 and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;Me, respectively. Adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions. This work provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Catalysed n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is introduced by using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles with alkylthiolated species (f&#8208;AuNPs) as a catalyst, which is activated at temperatures~70&#8201;&#176;C. This method ensures stables semiconductor+dopant+catalyst formulations and films but enables, upon mild heating, rapid and efficient n&#8208;doping as well as high electrical conductivity.







Abstract
A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is reported using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles (f&#8208;AuNPs) with alkylthiols acting as the catalyst only upon mild thermal activation. To demonstrate the versatility of this methodology, the reaction of the n&#8208;type dopant precursor N&#8208;DMBI&#8208;H with several molecular and polymeric semiconductors at different temperatures with/without f&#8208;AuNPs, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the unfunctionalized catalyst AuNPs, was investigated by spectroscopic, morphological, charge transport, and kinetic measurements as well as, computationally, the thermodynamic of catalyst activation. The combined experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that while f&#8208;AuNPs is inactive at room temperature both in solution and in the solid state, catalyst activation occurs rapidly at mild temperatures (~70&#8201;&#176;C) and the doping reaction completes in few seconds affording large electrical conductivities (~10&#8211;140&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The implementation of this methodology enables the use of semiconductor+dopant+catalyst solutions and will broaden the use of the corresponding n&#8208;doped films in opto&#8208;electronic devices such as thin&#8208;film transistors, electrochemical transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectrics well as guide the design of new catalysts.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship of p&#8208;block Bi element for selectivity CH4 was found. The CH4 selectivity of the p&#8208;block Bi element is also positively correlated with adsorption energy of *CHO. Further analysis indicates that the interaction in VO/Bi heterosites on Bi2MoO6 enhances the absorption and activation of *CHO, facilitates the *CO&#8208;*CHO process, and enriches carriers at the active site for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
Selective photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels, such as CH4, is highly desirable due to its high mass&#8208;energy density. Nevertheless, achieving selective CH4 with higher production yield on p&#8208;block materials is hindered by non&#8208;ideal adsorption of *CHO key intermediate and an unclear structure&#8208;function relationship. Herein, we unlock the key reaction steps of CO2 and found a volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion by gradual reduction of the p&#8208;band center of the p&#8208;block Bi element leading to formation of Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites. The selectivity of CH4 is also positive correlation with adsorption energy of *CHO. The Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites with an appropriate filled Bi&#8208;6p orbital electrons and p band center (&#8722;0.64) enhance the coupling between C&#8208;2p of *CHO and Bi&#8208;6p orbitals, thereby resulting in high selectivity (95.2&#8201;%) and productivity (17.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) towards CH4. Further studies indicate that the synergistic effect between Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites reduces Gibbs free energy for *CO&#8208;*CHO process, activates the C&#8722;H and C=O bonds of *CHO, and facilitates the enrichment of photoexcited electrons at active sites for multielectron photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. This work provides a new perspective on developing p&#8208;block elements for selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Alloy&#8208;Doped SEI Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and High&#8208;Rate Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;donating feature of the spontaneously formed Li&#8722;Au alloy promotes the directional decomposition of LiTFSI to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped composite functional SEI layer, which is more conducive to the rapid and uniform transport of Li ions, and a high&#8208;rate dendrite&#8208;free stable anode interface was obtained.







Abstract
Li metal is regarded as the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; in the next generation of anode materials due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, sluggish Li ions interfacial transport kinetics and uncontrollable Li dendrites growth limit practical application of the energy storage system in high&#8208;power device. Herein, separators are modified by the addition of a coating, which spontaneously grafts onto the Li anode interface for in situ lithiation. The resultant alloy possessing of strong electron&#8208;donating property promotes the decomposition of lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide in the electrolyte to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. High ionic alloy solid solution diffusivity and electric field dispersion modulation accelerate Li ions transport and uniform stripping/plating, resulting in a high&#8208;power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode interface. Surprisingly, the formulated SEI layer achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 8000&#8197;h (20,000&#8197;cycles) for symmetric cells at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It also ensures that the NCM(811)//PP@Au//Li full cell at ultra&#8208;high currents (40&#8197;C) completes the charging/discharging process in only 68&#8197;s to provide high capacity of 151&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The results confirm that this scalable strategy has great development potential in realizing high power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode.

The resultant alloy possessing of strong electron-donating property promotes the decomposition of lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide in the electrolyte to form a LiF-rich alloy-doped solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. High ionic alloy solid solution diffusivity and electric field dispersion modulation accelerate Li ions transport and uniform stripping/plating, resulting in a high-power dendrite-free Li metal anode interface. Surprisingly, the formulated SEI layer achieves an ultra-long cycle life of over 8000&#8197;h (20,000&#8197;cycles) for symmetric cells at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It also ensures that the NCM(811)//PP@Au//Li full cell at ultra-high currents (40&#8197;C) completes the charging/discharging process in only 68&#8197;s to provide high capacity of 151&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The results confirm that this scalable strategy has great development potential in realizing high power dendrite-free Li metal anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Domino Effect Triggered by &#946;&#8208;Alanine Cations Realized Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;ionized Ala+ cations trigger a domino effect after electrostatic adsorption at IHP. The electrostatic shielding regulates crystal energetic preference and realizes crystallographic optimization. The moderative electro&#8208;reduction kinetics caused by the adsorbed Ala+ realize the balance between interfacial consumption rate of Zn2+ ions and mass transfer rate, restrains the formation of concentration polarization and anion&#8208;depleted boundary.







Abstract
Realizing durative dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and no by&#8208;product deposition configuration on Zn anodes is crucial to solving the short circuit and premature failure of batteries, which is simultaneously determined by the Zn interface chemistry, electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, mass transfer process, and their interaction. Herein, this work unmasks a domino effect of the &#946;&#8208;alanine cations (Ala+) within the hydrogel matrix, which effectively triggers the subsequent electrostatic shielding and beneficial knock&#8208;on effects via the specifical adsorption earliest event on the Zn anode surface. The electrostatic shielding effect regulates the crystallographic energetic preference of Zn deposits and retards fast electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, thereby steering stacked stockier block morphology and realizing crystallographic optimization. Meanwhile, the mass transfer rate of Zn2+ ions was accelerated via the SO42&#8722; anion immobilized caused by Ala+ in bulk electrolyte, finally bringing the balance between electroreduction kinetics and mass transfer process, which enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition behavior. Concomitantly, the interfacial adsorbed Ala+ cations facilitate the electrochemical reduction of interfacial SO42&#8722; anions to form the inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase layer. The above domino effects immensely improve the utilization efficiency of Zn anodes and long&#8208;term stability, as demonstrated by the 12&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn cells (3650&#8197;h) and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.4&#8201;%).

         <title>Anisotropic Dual S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Mimic Natural Photosynthetic System for Boosting Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative biomimetic artificial photosynthetic system for the first time. The anisotropic migration of BiOBr carriers demonstrates exceptional charge pre&#8208;separation properties, effectively mimicking the role of electron transport chain observed in natural photosynthesis. The incorporation of a stepped dual S&#8208;Scheme band structure ensures the optimal simulation of the photosystem (PSII/PSI).







Abstract
The design of heterojunctions that mimic natural photosynthetic systems holds great promise for enhancing photoelectric response. However, the limited interfacial space charge layer (SCL) often fails to provide sufficient driving force for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Drawing inspiration from the electron transport chain (ETC) in natural photosynthesis system, we developed a novel anisotropic dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction artificial photosynthetic system composed of Bi2O3&#8722;BiOBr&#8722;AgI for the first time, with Bi2O3 and AgI selectively distributed along the bicrystal facets of BiOBr. Compared to traditional semiconductors, the anisotropic carrier migration in BiOBr overcomes the recombination resulting from thermodynamic diffusion, thereby establishing a potential ETC for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Importantly, this pioneering bioinspired design overcomes the limitations imposed by the limited distribution of SCL in heterojunctions, resulting in a remarkable 55&#8208;fold enhancement in photoelectric performance. Leveraging the etching of thiols on Ag&#8208;based materials, this dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is further employed in the construction of photoelectrochemical sensors for the detection of acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus pesticides.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Plastic and Biomass&#8208;Derived Polyols to Formamide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an electrocatalytic strategy to upgrade plastic and biomass to formamide in the presence of NH3 over a WO3 catalyst under ambient conditions. Facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, the C&#8722;C bond in PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol and biomass&#8208;derived polyols were effectively cleaved with C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of wasted plastic and renewable biomass represents a sustainable method to produce chemicals but is limited to carbohydrates, leaving other value&#8208;added chemicals, such as organonitrogen compounds, being scarcely explored. Herein, we reported an electrocatalytic oxidation strategy to transform polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) and biomass&#8208;derived polyols into formamide, in the presence of ammonia (NH3) over a tungsten oxide (WO3) catalyst. Taking EG&#8208;to&#8208;formamide as an example, we achieved a high formamide productivity of 537.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with FE of 43.2&#8201;% at a constant current of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow electrolyzer with 12&#8208;h test, representing a more advantageous performance compared with previous reports for formamide electrosynthesis. Mechanistic understanding revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the EG was facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, with resultant C&#8722;N bond construction and eventually formamide production. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to transformation of PET bottle and a series of biomass&#8208;derived polyols with carbon number from three (glycerol) to six (glucose), producing formamide with high efficiencies. This work demonstrates a sustainable upgrading strategy of plastic and biomass that may have implications to more value&#8208;added chemicals production beyond carbohydrates.

         <title>SERS Detection of Trace Carcinogenic Aromatic Amines Based on Amorphous MoO3 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers exhibit high SERS performance due to the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic effect. It is capable of trace detection and identification of carcinogenic aromatic amines with good uniformity, acid resistance and thermal stability, which is of great significance for reducing cancer risk.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are important commercial chemicals, but their carcinogenicity poses a threat to humans and other organisms, making their rapid quantitative detection increasingly urgent. Here, amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in the visible region are designed for the trace detection of carcinogenic aromatic amine molecules. The hot&#8208;electron fast decay component of a&#8208;MoO3 decreases from 301&#8197;fs to 150&#8197;fs after absorption with methyl orange (MO) molecules, indicating the plasmon&#8208;induced hot&#8208;electron transfer (PIHET) process from a&#8208;MoO3 to MO. Therefore, a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers present high SERS performance due to the synergistic effect of electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and PIHET, proposing the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic mechanism in a&#8208;MoO3. In addition, a&#8208;MoO3 possesses higher electron delocalization and electronic state density than crystal MoO3 (c&#8208;MoO3), which is conducive to the PIHET. The limit of detection (LOD) for o&#8208;aminoazotoluene (o&#8208;AAT) is 10&#8722;9&#8197;M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.

The limit of detection (LOD) for o-aminoazotoluene (o-AAT) is 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Super Hydrous Solvated Structure of Chaotropic Ca2+ Contributes Superior Anti&#8208;Freezing Aqueous Electrolytes and Stabilizes the Zn anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure is proposed to solve the problem of low temperature poor performance and Zn anode instability for AZIBs. Based on the Hofmeister series, the addition of chaotropic Ca2+ forms an eight&#8208;coordination solvation, which breaks the HBs between water molecules and results in a water&#8208;poor solvation of Zn2+. Zn||PTO batteries display excellent cycling stability and rate performance at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB&#8208;acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation&#8208;regulated HB&#8208;acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the glass transition temperature of hybrid 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 (M) ZnCl2+4&#8197;M CaCl2 electrolyte (&#8722;113.2&#8201;&#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca2+ contributes to the water&#8208;poor solvated structure of Zn2+, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 1600&#8208;time stable cycling at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a cheap and efficient aqueous electrolyte to simultaneously improve low&#8208;temperature performances and Zn stability, broadening the design concepts for antifreeze electrolytes.

         <title>Selective Increase in CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Activity at Nanograin&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich Mixed Cu(I)/Cu(0) Sites via Enriching Co&#8208;Adsorbed CO and Hydroxyl Species</title>

         <dc:description>
The ethylene generation pathway is usually thermodynamically preferred due to its lower activation energy barrier relative to ethanol product. Herein, we showed a method to high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion by enhancing the co&#8208;adsorption of *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species over a Cu2O&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured boundaries.







Abstract
Selective producing ethanol from CO2 electroreduction is highly demanded, yet the competing ethylene generation route is commonly more thermodynamically preferred. Herein, we reported an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion (53.5&#8201;% faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured grain&#8208;boundaries. The catalyst also attains a 23.2&#8201;% energy efficiency to ethanol within a flow cell reactor. In situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis identified that these dualphase Cu(I) and Cu(0) sites stabilized by grain&#8208;boundaries are very robust over the operating potential window, which maintains a high concentration of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of *OHad not only promote the easier dimerization of *CO to form *OCCO (&#916;G~0.20&#8197;eV) at low overpotentials but also preferentially favor the key *CHCOH intermediate hydrogenation to *CHCHOH (ethanol pathway) while suppressing its dehydration to *CCH (ethylene pathway), which is believed to determine the remarkable ethanol selectivity. Such imperative intermediates associated with the bifurcation pathway were directly distinguished by isotope labelling in situ infrared spectroscopy. Our work promotes the understanding of bifurcating mechanism of CO2ER&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons more deeply, providing a feasible strategy for the design of efficient ethanol&#8208;targeted catalysts.

         <title>Digital Light Processing to Afford High Resolution and Degradable CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiol&#8208;ene based 3D printing of a low molar mass CO2&#8208; and bio&#8208;derived ABA triblock copolymer through digital light processing is reported. A series of sustainable elastomers are produced with varying thiol cross&#8208;linker lengths and poly(ethylene glycol) content to print complex geometries at high resolution. The materials display printing induced phase separation, tunable hydrophilicity, and complete hydrolytic degradation.







Abstract
Vat photopolymerization 3D printing has proven very successful for the rapid additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric parts at high resolution. However, the range of materials that can be printed and their resulting properties remains narrow. Herein, we report the successful AM of a series of poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate) elastomers, derived from carbon dioxide and bio&#8208;derived &#1013;&#8208;decalactone. By employing a highly active and selective Co(II)Mg(II) polymerization catalyst, an ABA triblock copolymer (Mn=6.3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#208;M=1.26) was synthesized, formulated into resins which were 3D printed using digital light processing (DLP) and a thiol&#8208;ene&#8208;based crosslinking system. A series of elastomeric and degradable thermosets were produced, with varying thiol cross&#8208;linker length and poly(ethylene glycol) content, to produce complex triply periodic geometries at high resolution. Thermomechanical characterization of the materials reveals printing&#8208;induced microphase separation and tunable hydrophilicity. These findings highlight how utilizing DLP can produce sustainable materials from low molar mass polyols quickly and at high resolution. The 3D printing of these functional materials may help to expedite the production of sustainable plastics and elastomers with potential to replace conventional petrochemical&#8208;based options.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atom Sites with the Irving&#8211;Williams Series for the Simultaneous Co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and CH3CHO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to engineer single&#8208;atom sites from d5 to d10, the Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the highest stability and fastest charge&#8208;transfer efficiency. As predicted, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits a higher activity towards the photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs.







Abstract
The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8211;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8211;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+).

     alt="Engineering Single-Atom Sites with the Irving&#8211;Williams Series for the Simultaneous Co-photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and CH3CHO Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to engineer single-atom sites from d&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to d&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, the Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the highest stability and fastest charge-transfer efficiency. As predicted, Cu-SASs/CPFs exhibits a higher activity towards the photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO and the photooxidation of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, far surpassing other metal-SASs/CPFs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonding effects between 3d transition-metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition-metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8211;Williams series. However, engineering single-atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8211;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl-linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to d&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). The Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition-metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu-SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge-transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal-SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu-SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO activity (~30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH activity (~24.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Interestingly, the generated *O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is derived from the process of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, thereby triggering a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO oxidation reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of All&#8208;Benzene Multi&#8208;Macrocyclic Nanocarbons by Post&#8208;Functionalization of meta&#8208;Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;functionalization approach of meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes has been successfully established as a key to access topologically diverse, all&#8208;benzene multi&#8208;macrocyclic nanocarbons. Employing iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation followed by inter&#8208; and intramolecular C&#8722;C couplings, this approach enables the divergent and facile synthesis of novel all&#8208;benzene structural types including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane.







Abstract
Expanding the diversity of multi&#8208;macrocyclic nanocarbons, particularly those with all&#8208;benzene scaffolds, represents intriguing yet challenging synthetic tasks. Complementary to the existing synthetic approaches, here we report an efficient and modular post&#8208;functionalization strategy that employs iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation of the highly strained meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes (mCPPs) and an mCPP&#8208;derived catenane. Based on the functionalized macrocyclic synthons, a number of novel all&#8208;benzene topological structures including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane have been successfully prepared and characterized, thereby showcasing the synthetic utility and potential of the post&#8208;functionalization strategy.

         <title>Chloride&#8208; and Hydrosulfide&#8208;Bound 2Fe Complexes as Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Stable State of [FeFe] Hydrogenase</title>

Insights into the oxygen&#8208;stable state of the H&#8208;cluster are revealed. Terminal Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context, demonstrate a striking structural resemblance to the enzymatic Hinact state. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, and labile and kinetically controlled binding of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group.







Abstract
[FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of these enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722; ligation to the iron center bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact state of DdHydAB and CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans and Hinact states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans and Hinact states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to the advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and the integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.

The RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site is utilized to investigate the activation pathways of hydrogen atoms during AB hydrolysis. RuPt&#8722;Ti exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity with a high TOF of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1, outperforming most noble metals.







Abstract
Hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) involves multiple undefined steps and complex adsorption and activation, so single or dual sites are not enough to rapidly achieve the multi&#8208;step catalytic processes. Designing multi&#8208;site catalysts is necessary to enhance the catalytic performance of AB hydrolysis reactions but revealing the matching reaction mechanisms of AB hydrolysis is a great challenge. In this work, we propose to construct RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts to clarify the multi&#8208;site tandem activation mechanism of AB hydrolysis. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the multi&#8208;site tandem mode can respectively promote the activation of NH3BH3 and H2O molecules on the Ru and Pt sites as well as facilitate the fast transfer of *H and the desorption of H2 on Ti sites at the same time. RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis reaction, outperforming the single&#8208;site Ru, dual&#8208;site RuPt and Ru&#8722;Ti catalysts. This study proposes a multi&#8208;site tandem concept for accelerating the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage material, aiming to contribute to the development of cleaner, low&#8208;carbon, and high&#8208;performance hydrogen production systems.

The hydrocarbon backbone of vinyl polymers can be edited by mechanical force to achieve controlled degradation, wherein the cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide comonomer can be incorporated into the backbone of vinyl polymers through a photo&#8208;iniferter RAFT copolymerization pathway. The key aspect is that the cyclobutane units preserve the integrity of the polymer backbone during material application, while the cleavable imide groups can be selectively exposed through backbone editing upon mechanochemical activation. Subsequent hydrolysis of the imides facilitates efficient degradation and upcycling, resulting in the production of telechelic oligomers. This research holds the potential to inspire the design and modification of vinyl polymers through backbone editing.







Abstract
The chemically inert nature of fully saturated hydrocarbon backbones endows vinyl polymers with desirable durability, but it also leads to their significant environmental persistence. Enhancing the sustainability of these materials requires a pivotal yet challenging shift: transforming the inert backbone into one that is degradable. Here, we present a versatile platform for mechanochemically editing the fully saturated backbone of vinyl polymers towards degradable polymer chains by integrating cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide (CBS) units along backbone through photo&#8208;iniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) copolymerization. Significantly, the evenly insertion of CBS units does not compromise thermal or chemical stability but rather offers a means to adjust the properties of polymethylacrylate (PMA). Meanwhile, reactive acyclic imide units can be selectively introduced to the backbone through mechanochemical activation (pulse ultrasonication or ball&#8208;milling grinding) when required. Subsequent hydrolysis of the acyclic imide groups enables efficient degradation, yielding telechelic oligomers. This approach holds promise for inspiring the design and modification of more environmentally friendly vinyl polymers through backbone editing.

         <title>Lithium Borate Polycarbonates for High&#8208;Capacity Solid&#8208;State Composite Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
More elastic, softer, lithium borate substituted polycarbonates show higher ionic conductivity than counterparts with more rigid structures. These leading polymers are used as binders in composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich cathode, sulfide solid electrolyte and carbon. The cells show higher capacity and excellent retention of capacity over 300&#8197;charge/discharge cycles at a commercially realistic 1&#8197;MPa applied pressure.







Abstract
Improving composite cathode function is key to the success of the solid&#8208;state battery. Maximizing attainable cathode capacity and retention requires integrating suitable polymeric binders that retain a sufficiently high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term chemo&#8208;mechanical stability of the cathode active material&#8208;solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;carbon mixture. Herein, we report block copolymer networks composed of lithium borate polycarbonates and poly(ethylene oxide) that improved the capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and capacity retention (94&#8201;% over 300&#8197;cycles) of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode active material, Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, and carbon. Tetrahedral B(OR)2(OH)2&#8722; anions immobilized on the polycarbonate segments provide hydrogen&#8208;bonding chain crosslinking and selective Li&#8208;counterion conductivity, parameterized by Li&#8208;ion transference numbers close to unity (tLi+~0.94). With 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% polycarbonate content and a flexible low glass transition temperature backbone, the single&#8208;ion conductors achieved high Li&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The work should inform future binder design for improving the processability of cathode composites towards commercializing solid&#8208;state batteries, and allow use in other cell configurations, such as lithium&#8208;sulphur cathode designs.

         <title>Shape Shifting and Locking in Mechanically Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials for Thermoelastic Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>

Thermoelastic organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy=2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) undergo two phase transitions at 310&#8197;K and 380&#8197;K. When heated to 380&#8197;K, the crystals show shape shifting and expand along the b&#8208;axis by about 13.4&#8201;%, corresponding to a larger deformation than that of thermally activated shape memory alloys (8.5&#8201;%), and exhibits a strong actuation force. During cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreases to 305&#8197;K.







Abstract
The construction of mechanically responsive materials with reversible shape&#8208;shifting, shape&#8208;locking, and stretchability holds promise for a wide range of applications in fields such as soft robotics and flexible electronics. Here, we report novel thermoelastic one&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy=2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) to show mechanical responses. The single crystals undergo two phase transitions at 310&#8197;K and 380&#8197;K. When heated to 380&#8197;K, they show shape&#8208;shifting and expansion along the b&#8208;axis by about 13.4&#8201;%, corresponding to a larger deformation than that of thermally activated shape memory alloys (8.5&#8201;%), and exhibit a strong actuation force. During the cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreases to 305&#8197;K. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of chiral ions, the thermal switching shows a 10&#8208;fold second&#8208;order nonlinear switching contrast (common values typically below 3&#8208;fold). This study presents a thermoelastic actuator based on shape&#8208;shifting and &#8208;locking of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids for the first time. The dielectric and nonlinear optical switching properties of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids broaden the range of applications of mechanically responsive crystals.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Azo Cathodes Enabled by N&#8208;Heteroatomic Substitution for Zinc Batteries with a Self&#8208;Charging Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroatomic substitution strategy is used to optimize the chemical and electronic properties of azo compounds. The developed 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine cathode exhibits significantly improved operating voltage, thermal stability, and reaction kinetics. Remarkably, the depleted batteries exhibit a distinctive self&#8208;charging feature upon air exposure.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active azo compounds are emerging as promising cathode materials due to their multi&#8208;electron redox capacity and fast redox response. However, their practical application is often limited by low output voltage and poor thermal stability. Herein, we use a heteroatomic substitution strategy to develop 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine. This modification results in a 350&#8197;mV increase in reduction potential compared to traditional azobenzene, increasing the energy density at the material level from 187 to 291&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The introduced heteroatoms not only raise the melting point of azo compounds from 68&#8201;&#176;C to 112&#8201;&#176;C by forming an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network but also improves electrode kinetics by reducing energy band gaps. Moreover, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine forms metal&#8208;ligand complexes with Zn2+ ions, which further self&#8208;assemble into a robust superstructure, acting as a molecular conductor to facilitate charge transfer. Consequently, the batteries display a good rate performance (192&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 60,000&#8197;cycles. Notably, we disclose that the depleted batteries spontaneously self&#8208;charge when exposed to air, marking a significant advancement in the development of self&#8208;powered aqueous systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal, and Kagome topologies was explored to design porous frameworks, which led to the creation of 1D nanochannels of different shapes and sizes. The pore shape and size play a vital role in developing proton carrier networks and determines proton conduction functions, unveiling a full picture of pore chemistry and offering a general yet transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials.







Abstract
Proton conduction is important in both fundamental research and technological development. Here we report designed synthesis of crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks as a new platform for high&#8208;rate anhydrous proton conduction. By developing nanochannels with different topologies as proton pathways and loading neat phosphoric acid to construct robust proton carrier networks in the pores, we found that pore topology is crucial for proton conduction. Its effect on increasing proton conductivity is in an exponential mode other than linear fashion, endowing the materials with exceptional proton conductivities exceeding 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 over a broad range of temperature and a low activation energy barrier down to 0.24&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the pore size controls conduction mechanism, where mesopores promote proton conduction via a fast&#8208;hopping mechanism, while micropores follow a sluggish vehicle process. Notably, decreasing phosphoric acid loading content drastically reduces proton conductivity and greatly increases activation energy barrier, emphasizing the pivotal role of well&#8208;developed proton carrier network in proton transport. These findings and insights unveil a new general and transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials and systems for high&#8208;rate ion conduction, energy storage, and energy conversion.

         <title>Flexible Aqueous Cr&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors with Remarkable Electrochemical Properties in all Climates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid supercapacitor assembled from a chromium metal anode based on an electroplating/stripping mechanism and a porous graphitized carbon fabric cathode is proposed. This research made an advance in developing a reversible chromium metal deposition/dissolution process, and the device obtained an efficient and stable energy storage capability under all climate circumstances.







Abstract
The integration of hostless battery&#8208;like metal anodes for hybrid supercapacitors is a realistic design method for energy storage devices with promising future applications. With significant Cr element deposits on Earth, exceptionally high theoretical capacity (1546&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and accessible redox potential (&#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) of Cr metals, the design of Cr anodes has rightly come into our focus. This work presents a breakthrough design of a flexible Cr&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (CHSC) based on a porous graphitized carbon fabric (PGCF) substrate prepared by K2FeO4 activation. In the CHSC device, PGCF acts as both a current collector and cathode material due to its high specific surface area and superior conductivity. The use of a highly concentrated LiCl&#8722;CrCl3 electrolyte with high Cr plating/stripping efficiency and excellent antifreeze properties enables the entire PGCF&#8208;based CHSC to achieve well&#8208;balanced performance in terms of energy density (up to 1.47&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2), power characteristics (reaching 9.95&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durability (95.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000&#8197;cycles), while realizing it to work well under harsh conditions of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work introduces a new concept for low&#8208;temperature energy storage technology and confirms the potential application of Cr anodes in hybrid supercapacitors.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Like Diffusion of Fast Ions in Framework Energy Materials for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assisted by density functional theory calculations, we found in this study that the origin of the ultra&#8208;low migration energy barrier of intercalated ions in framework energy materials (e.g. Prussian blue analogs) is a unique surface&#8208;like diffusion mechanism. The mobile ion will move along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance similar to surface diffusion.







Abstract
The rate performance, power density, and energy efficiency of electrochemical devices are often limited by ionic conductivities in electrolyte and electrode materials. Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high&#8208;rate electrodes for sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid&#8208;state Na+/Li+ transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra&#8208;low activation energy and anomalous pre&#8208;exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid&#8208;state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface&#8208;like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface&#8208;like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle&#8208;point geometry and high migration barrier. We found that the shifting from solid&#8208;state lattice diffusion to surface&#8208;like diffusion is determined by the size difference between the mobile ion and the diffusion channel, and a lowest migration energy barrier can be reached by mediating the channel size. The analogy to gas diffusion in molecular sieves shall be discussed. Additionally, the effects of defects and crystal water in Prussian blue analogs were also discussed for better understanding their rate performances in experimental scenarios.

ATPP2SnCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+ (ATPP=acetonyltriphenylphosphonium) was derived from the rational construction of emissive organic reagent of ATPPCl and Sn4+ to form rigid structure, and the subsequent doping of Sb3+. Multi&#8208;excitonic emissions with one from organic cation and the other from the extrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons were investitated, and the tunable photoluminescence could be realized by varing the excitaton wavelengths. Leveraging the multi&#8208;excitonic centers for the doped samples, information encryption and decryption could be achieved, showing the potential anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;excitonic emitting materials in luminescent metal halides are emerging candidates for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. Herein, ATPP2SnCl6 (ATPP=acetonyltriphenylphosphonium) phase was designed and synthesized by rationally choosing emissive organic reagent of ATPPCl and non&#8208;toxic stable metal ions of Sn4+, and Sb3+ was further doped into ATPP2SnCl6 to tune the photoluminescence with external self&#8208;trapped excitons emission. The derived non&#8208;toxic ATPP2SnCl6 shows multi&#8208;excitonic luminescent centers verified by optical study and differential charge&#8208;density from density functional theory calculations. Incorporation of Sb3+ dopants and the increasing concentrations induce the efficient energy transfer therein, thus enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield from 5.1&#8201;% to 73.8&#8201;%. The multi&#8208;excitonic emission inspires the creation of information encryption and decryption by leveraging the photoluminescence from ATPPCl to ATPP2SnCl6 host and ATPP2SnCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+. This study facilitates the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application by employing solution&#8208;processable luminescent metal halides materials with excitation&#8208;dependent PL properties.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea over Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Electronic Metal Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy on CeO2 nanorods are designed for efficient electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2. Cu single atoms modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Alloy sites accelerate the formation of C&#8722;N bond through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO. Electronic metal support interaction further modulates the interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an alternative approach to traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. Herein, we report a CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) with electronic metal support interaction (EMSI), achieving a high urea yield rate of 813.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.94&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. RHE. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that single&#8208;atom Cu sites modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Bimetallic sites synergistically accelerate C&#8722;N bond formation through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO to form *ONCO as key intermediates. More importantly, electronic metal support interaction between CuAu SAA and CeO2 carrier further modulates electron structure and interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability. This work constructs SAA electrocatalysts with EMSI effect to tailor C&#8722;N coupling at the atomic level, which can provide guidance for the development of C&#8722;N coupling systems.

         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of triphenylamine[3]arenes using triphenylamine derivatized monomers via a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with paraformaldehyde is presented. These three&#8208;fold symmetric macrocycles, featuring alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, exhibit versatile properties in luminescence and iodine adsorption, and serve as building blocks for extended frameworks and molecular cages.







Abstract
Triphenylamine[3]arenes (TPA[3]s), featuring [16]paracyclophane backbone with alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, were synthesized through a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction using triphenylamine derivatized monomers and paraformaldehyde. This molecular design yielded a series of TPA[3] macrocycles with high efficiency, with their facile derivatizations also successfully demonstrated. On account of the strong electron&#8208;donating properties of the TPA moieties, these TPA[3]s exhibit remarkable delayed fluorescence, and possess a significant affinity for iodine. Furthermore, their inherent three&#8208;fold symmetry rendered TPA[3]s as novel building blocks for the construction of extended frameworks and molecular cages. This advancement expands the versatility of discrete macrocycles into complex architectures, enhancing their applicability across a broad spectrum of applications.

         <title>Variant&#8208;Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte without Phase Separation for Low&#8208;Temperature Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal low&#8208;temperature electrolyte with variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) structure was designed to avoid the phase separation, which endowed DIBs with long&#8208;term cycling stability, excellent discharge characteristic, and outstanding low&#8208;temperature performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) present great application potential in low&#8208;temperature energy storage scenarios due to their unique dual&#8208;ion working mechanism. However, at low temperatures, the insufficient electrochemical oxidation stability of electrolytes and depressed interfacial compatibility impair the DIB performance. Here, we design a variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation structure for universal low&#8208;temperature electrolytes (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) without the phase separation via introducing an extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent with low energy levels. The unique solvation structure gives the &#957;&#8208;LHCE enhanced electrochemical oxidation stability. Meanwhile, the extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent can competitively participate in the Li+&#8208;solvated coordination, which improves the Li+ transfer kinetics and boosts the formation of robust interphases. Thus, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte not only has a good high&#8208;voltage stability of &gt;5.5&#8197;V and proper Li+ transference number of 0.51 but also shows high ionic conductivities of 1 mS/cm at low temperatures. Consequently, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte enables different types of batteries to achieve excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and good rate capability at both room and low temperatures. Especially, the capacity retentions of the DIB are 77.7&#8201;% and 51.6&#8201;%, at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, indicating great potential for low&#8208;temperature energy storage applications, such as polar exploration, emergency communication equipment, and energy storage station in cold regions.

Designing narrow band gap acceptors with high PLQY and strong crystallinity can effectively reduce non&#8208;radiative energy losses and enhance OSC performance. We synthesized DM&#8208;F, an A&#8211;D&#8211;A fused&#8208;ring acceptor, which hinders H&#8208;aggregate formation, boosts PLQY, and shows strong near&#8208;infrared absorption and crystallinity. DM&#8208;F&#8208;based OSCs exhibit low &#9653;Enr (0.14&#8197;eV) and high PCE, reaching 16.16&#8201;% and 20.09&#8201;% in binary and ternary cells, respectively.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing narrow band gap acceptors that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and strong crystallinity is a highly effective, yet challenging, approach to reducing non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#9653;Enr) and boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). We have successfully designed and synthesized an A&#8211;D&#8211;A type fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, named DM&#8208;F, which features a planar molecular backbone adorned with bulky three&#8208;dimensional camphane side groups at its central core. These bulky substituents effectively hinder the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of the acceptors, promoting the formation of more J&#8208;aggregates and notably elevating the PLQY of the acceptor in the film. As anticipated, DM&#8208;F showcases pronounced near&#8208;infrared absorption coupled with impressive crystallinity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) leveraging DM&#8208;F exhibit a high EQEEL value and remarkably low &#9653;Enr of 0.14&#8197;eV&#8208;currently the most minimal reported value for OSCs. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary and ternary OSCs utilizing DM&#8208;F has reached 16.16&#8201;% and 20.09&#8201;%, respectively, marking a new apex in reported efficiency within the OSCs field. In conclusion, our study reveals that designing narrow band gap acceptors with high PLQY is an effective way to reduce &#9653;Enr and improve the PCE of OSCs.

Abstract
Plastic pollution is an emerging global threat due to lack of effective methods for transforming waste plastics into useful resources. Here, we demonstrate a direct oxidative upcycling of polyethylene into high&#8208;value and high&#8208;volume saturated dicarboxylic acids in high carbon yield of 85.9&#8201;% in which the carbon yield of long chain dicarboxylic (C10&#8208;C20) acids can reach 58.9% over cobalt&#8208;doped MCM&#8208;41 molecular sieves, in the absence of any solvent or precious metal catalyst. The distribution of the dicarboxylic acids can be controllably adjusted from short&#8208;chain (C4&#8208;C10) to long&#8208;chain ones (C10&#8208;C20) through changing cobalt loading of MCM&#8208;41 under nanoconfinement. Highly and sparsely dispersed cobalt along with confined space of mesoporous structure enables complete degradation of polyethylene and high selectivity of dicarboxylic acid in mild condition. So far, this is the first report on highly selective one&#8208;step preparation of long chain dicarboxylic acids. The approach provides an attractive solution to tackle plastic pollution and a promising alternative route to long chain diacids.

         <title>Inside Cover: Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 33/2024)</title>

         <dc:description>
Low selectivity is a key scientific challenge that hinders the commercialization of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In their Research Article (e202407287), Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu et&#8197;al. found that the CH4 selectivity of p&#8208;block Bi element exhibits a &#8220;volcanic&#8221; structure&#8208;function relationship when gradually decreasing the p&#8208;band center. This CH4 selectivity of Bi element is also positively correlated with the adsorption energy of key intermediate *CHO and the photoexcited carriers separation efficiency.

Built&#8208;in protection. A 1&#8208;step synthesis of supported metal phosphides from cheap precursors is described in the Research Article by Constanze&#8197;N. Neumann (e202404292). The approach delivers Ni2P/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 containing surface ligands that protect the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst from air oxidation. Facile displacement of the surface&#8208;bound phenyl phosphates by substrate molecules gives rise to catalytic activity on par with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst.

Light&#8208;induced dynamic metal nanocrystal/semiconductor interfaces during carbon dioxide electroreduction were investigated by utilizing synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, as reported by Hao Ming Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403333). The dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction under illumination result in an intriguing selectivity switch and realize an improvement of at least 16&#8208;fold in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrogen Fixation Using Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Catalysts under Ambient or Mild Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalysts to convert N2 into NH3 under ambient reaction conditions, where involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer has been effective for high catalytic activity. Direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic NH3 formation, selective catalytic hydrazine formation, and catalytic C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;N bond formation have been also established.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is industrially produced from dinitrogen (N2) and dihydrogen (H2) by the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, although H2 is prepared from fossil fuels, and the reaction requires harsh conditions. On the other hand, microorganisms have fixed nitrogen under ambient reaction conditions. Recently, well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalyst to convert N2 into NH3 by reactions with chemical reductants and proton sources under ambient reaction conditions. Among them, involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer is found to be very effective for high catalytic activity. Furthermore, direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversions of N2 into NH3 have been recently achieved. In addition to catalytic formation of NH3, selective catalytic conversion of N2 into hydrazine (NH2NH2) and catalytic silylation of N2 into silylamines have been reported. Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation has been more recently established to afford cyanate anion (NCO&#8722;) under ambient reaction conditions. Further development of direct conversion of N2 into nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds as well as green ammonia synthesis leading to the use of ammonia as an energy carrier is expected.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Frameworks (SAFs): Shaping the Future of Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) emerge as a novel class of porous structures distinguished by their strategic use of non&#8208;covalent interactions. SAFs not only exhibit exceptional porosity, crystallinity, and structural stability, but also offer a solution to the limitations of MOFs and COFs caused by their dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics. This development represents a significant advance in porous material chemistry, opening avenues for new applications and research.







Abstract
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) represent a new category of porous materials, utilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions, setting them apart from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This category includes but is not restricted to hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks. SAFs stand out for their outstanding porosity, crystallinity, and stability, alongside unique dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics that enable significant structural and functional modifications. Crucially, their non&#8208;covalent assembly strategies allow for a balanced manipulation of porosity, symmetry, crystallinity, and dimensions, facilitating the creation of advanced crystalline porous materials unattainable through conventional covalent or coordination bond synthesis. Despite their considerable promise in overcoming several limitations inherent to MOFs and COFs, particularly in terms of solution&#8208;processability, SAFs have received relatively little attention in recent literature. This Minireview aims to shed light on standout SAFs, exploring their design principles, synthesis strategies, and characterization methods. It emphasizes their distinctive features and the broad spectrum of potential applications across various domains, aiming to catalyze further development and practical application within the scientific community.

         <title>Design and Evolution of an Enzyme for the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroolefins by Enamine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stereoselective Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins was promoted by a designer artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue through enamine catalysis. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroketones were prepared by this efficient biocatalytic strategy for ketone functionalization in a study highlighting the utility of artificial enzymes for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions.







Abstract
Consistent introduction of novel enzymes is required for developing efficient biocatalysts for challenging biotransformations. Absorbing catalytic modes from organocatalysis may be fruitful for designing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes with novel functions. Herein we report a newly designed artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue that catalyzes the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins through enamine activation with high efficiency. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro cyclic ketones with two stereocenters were efficiently prepared with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% e.e., &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and good yield (up to 86&#8201;%). This work provides an efficient biocatalytic strategy for cyclic ketone functionalization, and highlights the usefulness of artificial enzymes for extending biocatalysis to further non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Amino Acid Building Blocks for Bioorthogonal Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids (NPAAs) containing hypervalent iodine reagents &#8208;ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs)&#8208; is described. These NPAAs were compatible with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution peptide synthesis (SPS), allowing the introduction of reactive handles on specific sites in the presence of multiple identical residues. The obtained peptide&#8208;EBXs can be applied to the synthesis of cyclic peptides with unique topological properties.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EB(X)xs) reagents have emerged as useful reagents for peptide/protein modification due to their versatile reactivity and high selectivity. Herein, we report the successful introduction of ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs) on different amino acid building blocks (Lys/Orn/Dap), and show their compatibility with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution phase peptide synthesis (SPS). The selective incorporation of the EBx core into peptide sequences enable efficient macrocyclizations under mild conditions for the synthesis of topologically unique cyclic and bicyclic peptides.

         <title>Chiral Teropyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a chiral teropyrene was achieved through a four&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation, leveraging InCl3 catalysis. This compound exhibits both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, underscoring its significance in advancing chiral optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
We present the inaugural synthesis of a chiral teropyrene achieved through a four&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation catalyzed by InCl3, resulting in good yields. The product underwent thorough characterization using FT&#8208;Raman and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies, demonstrating a close agreement with calculated spectra. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis unveiled a notable twist in the molecule&#8216;s backbone, with an end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angle of 51&#176;, consistent with computational predictions. Experimentally determined enantiomeric inversion barriers revealed a significant energy barrier of 23&#8197;kcal/mol, facilitating the isolation of enantiomers for analysis by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopies. These findings mark significant strides in the synthesis and characterization of chiral teropyrenes, offering insights into their structural and spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Biocatalytic Nucleobase Diversification of 4&#8242;&#8208;Thionucleosides and Application of Derived 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine for RNA Synthesis Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic platform towards 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides is presented that enables both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This approach delivers entry to pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, and chemoenzymatic synthesis provided 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine as a novel nucleoside probe to monitor RNA synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proven to be transformative in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. One branch of structural modification to deliver new nucleoside analogue classes explores replacement of canonical ribose oxygen with a sulfur atom. Whilst biological activity of such analogues has been shown in some cases, widespread exploration of this compound class is hitherto hampered by the lack of a straightforward and universal nucleobase diversification strategy. Herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration. We exemplify our approach by enzymatic synthesis of 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine on multi&#8208;milligram scale and from here switch to complete chemical synthesis of a novel nucleoside analogue probe, 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this probe to monitor RNA synthesis in proliferating HeLa cells, validating its capability as a new metabolic RNA labelling tool.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkenylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly efficient and enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes promoted by an easily accessible cobalt&#8208;based complex was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a wide range of alkenyl groups with diversified substitution patterns as well as axial stereogenicity into enantioenriched allylic alcohols.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes with easily accessible alkenyl halides promoted by a chiral cobalt complex derived from a newly developed tridentate bisoxazolinephosphine is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis and a general approach that enable rapid construction of highly diversified enantioenriched allylic alcohols containing a 1,1&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and trisubstituted alkene as well as axial stereogenicity in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er without the need of preformation of alkenyl&#8211;metal reagents. DFT calculations revealed the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation using a metallaphotoredox approach is a key method for rapidly building molecular complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride, a heterogeneous semiconductor, can act as a suitable photocatalyst to induce decarboxylative bond formation. A broad scope of coupling partners is presented, in addition to photocatalyst recycling, analysis, and mechanistic investigations.







Abstract
The development of robust and reliable methods for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds is vital for accessing an increased array of structurally diverse scaffolds in drug discovery and development campaigns. While significant advances towards this goal have been achieved using metallaphotoredox chemistry, many of these methods utilise photocatalysts based on precious&#8208;metals due to their efficient redox processes and tuneable properties. However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) and energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.

         <title>Isolable T&#8208;Shaped Planar Silyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of an unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt. The non&#8208;classical geometry enables this silyl anion to feature a silicon&#8208;centred HOMO, LUMO and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. It not only exhibits nucleophilic behaviour but also undergoes oxidative additions to CO2 and arylisonitrile. Notably, it represents the first example of silyl anions capable of cleaving C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silyl anions have garnered significant attention due to their synthetic abilities. However, previously reported silyl anions have been limited to either trigonal&#8208;pyramidal or trigonal&#8208;planar geometries, which confine them primarily as nucleophiles in substitution reactions. Herein, we report the isolation of the unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt 2 by employment of a geometrically constrained triamido pincer ligand. Theoretical calculations disclosed that the silicon centre in 2 possesses both a lone pair of electrons and an empty 3pz orbital. In addition to nucleophilic substitution reactions with Ph3PAuCl and W(CO)6, 2 readily undergoes oxidative additions with CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylisonitrile at room temperature. Furthermore, under mild conditions, compound 2 cleaves Csp2&#8722;H, Csp2&#8722;H, and H&#8722;H bonds in 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene, an intramolecular iPr group, and dihydrogen, representing the first examples of C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H activations mediated by a silyl anion, respectively. This work unveils new reactivity of silyl anions owing to the non&#8208;classical geometry and electronic structure.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from C64 Nanographene Tetraimide by &#960;&#8208;Stacking Complexation with Platinum Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) at the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum is challenging to achieve. Here, we show the sensitization of C64 nanographene tetraimide's triplet state by supramolecular complexation with a platinum porphyrin that exerts an external heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit coupling involving Pt d&#8208;orbitals and nanographene &#960;&#8208;orbitals.







Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at room temperature is challenging to achieve for organic molecules due to negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling and a low energy gap leading to fast non&#8208;radiative transitions. Here, we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to harvest the energy from the low&#8208;lying triplet state of C64 nanographene tetraimide 1. 1H&#8197;NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometric binding of a Pt(II) porphyrin on the two &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1. While the free 1 does not show emission in the NIR, the host&#8211;guest complex solution shows NIR phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. Further, between 860&#8211;1100&#8197;nm, room temperature NIR phosphorescence (&#955;max=900&#8197;nm, &#964;avg=142&#8197;&#956;s) was observed for a solid&#8208;state sample drop&#8208;casted from a preformed complex in solution. Theoretical calculations reveal a non&#8208;zero spin&#8211;orbit coupling between isoenergetic S1 and T3 of &#960;&#8208;stacked [1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pt(II) porphyrin] complex. External heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit coupling along with rigidification and protection from oxygen in the solid&#8208;state promotes both the intersystem crossing from the first excited singlet state into the triplet manifold and the NIR phosphorescence from the lowest triplet state of 1.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Distal C(sp3)&#8722;H Bromination of Aliphatic Amines as a Gateway for Forging Nitrogen&#8208;Containing sp3 Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective bromination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in unprotected aliphatic amines has been developed, achieved by tuning of the electronics properties of the proximal C&#8722;H bonds via substrate protonation. Consecutive intramolecular cyclization of alkyl bromide offered a series of N&#8208;containing heterocycles characterized by high ring strains. Moreover, the resulting C(sp3)&#8722;Br serves as a synthetic linchpin can be readily transferred to C(sp3)&#8722;C, N, O bonds, enabling diverse functionalization at previously untouched C(sp3)&#8722;H sites.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new strategy that rapidly and reliably incorporates bromine atoms at distal, secondary C(sp3)&#8722;H sites in aliphatic amines with an excellent and predictable site&#8208;selectivity pattern. The resulting halogenated building blocks serve as versatile linchpins to enable a series of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;formations at remote C(sp3) sites, thus offering a new modular and unified platform that expediates the access to advanced sp3 architectures possessing valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles of interest in medicinal chemistry settings.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first enantioselective method for the cyclopropanation of difluorinated olefins is presented. Using engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts in combination with diazoacetonitrile as the carbene precursor, the present method enables the production of different fluorinated cyclopropanes with high yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Fluorinated cyclopropanes are highly desired pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to the rigid nature of the cyclopropane ring and the beneficial effects of C&#8722;F bonds on the pharmacokinetic properties, cell permeability, and metabolic stability of drug molecules. Herein a biocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mono&#8208;fluorinated and gem&#8208;difluoro cyclopropanes is reported though the use of engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts. In particular, this system allows for a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoro alkenes to be cyclopropanated in the presence of diazoacetonitrile with excellent diastereo and enantiocontrol (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8201;e.e.), thereby enabling a transformation not currently accessible with chemocatalytic methods. The synthetic utility of the present approach is further exemplified through the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a key gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropane intermediate useful for the preparation of fluorinated bioactive molecules.

         <title>Metal Ions Trigger the Gelation of Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptide&#8208;Appended Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three FeII4L4 metal&#8208;organic cages were fabricated via a L&#8722;D&#8722;L&#8208;tripeptide ligand with different sequences. The cages could form gels triggered by coordinating thiol groups of peripheral peptides around metal vertices to the second metal ion. This strategy might allow for the modular and conventional design of other recyclable and functional cage&#8208;gel materials.







Abstract
We report a series of coordination cages that incorporate peptide chains at their vertices, prepared through subcomponent self&#8208;assembly. Three distinct heterochiral tripeptide subcomponents were incorporated, each exhibiting an L&#8722;D&#8722;L stereoconfiguration. Through this approach, we prepared and characterized three tetrahedral metal&#8208;peptide cages that incorporate thiol and methylthio groups. The gelation of these cages was probed through the binding of additional metal ions, with the metal&#8208;peptide cages acting as junctions, owing to the presence of sulfur atoms on the peripheral peptides. Gels were obtained with cages bearing cysteine at the C&#8208;terminus. Our strategy for developing functional metal&#8208;coordinated supramolecular gels with a modular design may result in the development of materials useful for chemical separations or drug delivery.

         <title>Photoinitiated Transient Self&#8208;Assembly in a Catalytically Driven Chemical Reaction Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show a catalytically&#8208;driven chemical reaction network (CRN) photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light. By combining photoredox and organometallic catalysis relying on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release deactivating fuel, we can control the formation of transient supramolecular fibers. Irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of deactivating fuel, leading to faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light activation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.







Abstract
Chemically fueled chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential in controlling dissipative self&#8208;assembly. A key challenge in the field is to store chemical fuel&#8208;precursors or &#8220;pre&#8208;fuels&#8221; in the system that are converted into activating or deactivating fuels in a catalytically controlled CRN. In addition, real&#8208;time control over catalysis in a CRN by light is highly desirable, but so far not yet achieved. Here we show a catalytically driven CRN that is photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light, producing activated monomers that go on to perform transient self&#8208;assembly. Monomer activation proceeds via photoredox catalysis, converting the monomer alcohol groups into the corresponding aldehydes that self&#8208;assemble into large supramolecular fibers. Monomer deactivation is achieved by organometallic catalysis that relies on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release formate (i.e. the deactivating fuel). Additionally, irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of formate by photo&#8208;uncaging the pre&#8208;fuel, leading to a factor of ca. 2 faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light photoactivation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled redox gold catalysis. Unlike the classical Cope rearrangement involving 1,5&#8208;hexadienes, a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes using the merger of &#960;&#8208;activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactivity, has been achieved.







Abstract
Cope rearrangements have garnered significant attention owing to their ability to undergo structural reorganization in stereoselective manner. While substantial advances have been achieved over decades, these rearrangements remained applicable exclusively to parent 1,5&#8208;hexadienes. Herein, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes via a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement employing ligand&#8208;enabled gold redox catalysis. Detailed mechanistic investigations including several control experiments, cross&#8208;over experiment, HRMS analysis, 31P&#8197;NMR and DFT studies have been performed to underpin the mechanism.

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.

The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d-HAT mechanism. This d-HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;Efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trilayer polymer electrolyte was devised to enable the coexistence of high local pH at the cathode surface and acidic interfaces within the membrane, thus concurrently favoring C2H4 formation and addressing the CO2 loss issue. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of ~46&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass conversion of ~32&#8201;% were achieved for C2H4 at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a result, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46&#8201;% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64&#8201;% at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32&#8201;% at 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8212;nearly 1.3&#8197;times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

         <title>Subsets of Nanometer Vesicles in the Fly Release Differential Fractions of Vesicular Serotonin Content during Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is important in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. Malfunction of serotonin signaling leads to various disorders. We studied serotonin signaling from serotonergic neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster. Serotonergic neurons and stimulated release were visualized and achieved with mCherry and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2, an optogenetically transfected ion channel, respectively, and two electrochemical techniques quantified serotonin release and vesicular content. Mean vesicular serotonin content released during exocytosis from these neurons was 84%, considerably higher than previous studies regarding octopamine (4.5%) and glutamate release (31%). Serotonin content within all vesicles is uniformly changed when serotonin concentration is inhibited or enhanced. However, serotonin release exhibits two Gaussian distributions: higher frequency of small release events, and similar or slightly higher frequency of large events, resulting in differential release fractions ranging from partial (30 to 35%) to full (100%) release after treatment with agents to either enhance or diminish release. This is the first example of consistent full exocytotic release events we have observed in any system. We suggest one pool of vesicles can release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis, a potentially novel pathway to regulate exocytosis and neuronal signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2',7,7'&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9'&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178 V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155 V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, those with Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 exhibit enhanced stability under N2 and ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell therapies such as CAR&#8208;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8208;Lys&#8208;Gly&#8208;Dopa&#8208;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc = fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta = Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy has been used to affect a simple cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated supramolecular heterodimerisation. A further photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition leads to the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane.







Abstract
In contrast to the self&#8208;assembly of homosupramolecules, the self&#8208;assembly of heterosupramolecules is more challenging and significant in various fields. Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerisation based on an arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy. Furthermore, the heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system that not only contributes to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriches synthetic methods for mechanically interlocked molecules.

Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril-mediated heterodimerisation based on an arene-fluoroarene strategy. Furthermore, the heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system that not only contributes to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriches synthetic methods for mechanically interlocked molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiphoton&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Defluorination of Persistent Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Polymers by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl substances and fluorinated polymers were efficiently decomposed to fluoride ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals. The decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and fluorinated polymers (FPs) have been extensively utilized in various industries, whereas their extremely high stability poses environmental persistence and difficulty in waste treatment. Current decomposition approaches of PFASs and FPs typically require harsh conditions such as heating over 400&#8201;&#176;C. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a new technique capable of decomposing them under mild conditions. Here, we demonstrated that perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), known as a &#8220;persistent chemical,&#8221; and Nafion, a widely utilized sulfonated FP for ion&#8208;exchange membranes, can be efficiently decomposed into fluorine ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). PFOS was completely defluorinated within 8&#8208;h irradiation of 405&#8208;nm LED light, and the turnover number of the C&#8722;F bond dissociation per NC was 17200. Furthermore, 81&#8201;% defluorination of Nafion was achieved for 24&#8208;h light irradiation, demonstrating the efficient photocatalytic properties under visible light. We revealed that this decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of efficiently breaking down various PFASs and FPs under mild conditions but also paves the way for advancing toward a sustainable fluorine&#8208;recycling society.

         <title>Highly Fluorinated Nanospace in Porous Organic Salts with High Water Stability/Capability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully constructed uniform highly fluorinated nanospaces without impurities such as metals. This highly hydrophobic nanospace exhibits high water stability, and is the first all&#8208;organic hydrophobic nanospace where water molecules can enter. Furthermore, this nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity of 1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH.







Abstract
Water in hydrophobic nanospaces shows specific dynamic properties different from bulk water. The investigation of these properties is important in various research fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. The elucidation of the correlation between properties of water and hydrophobic nanospaces requires nanospaces covered only with simple hydrophobic group (e.g., fluorine) without impurities such as metals. This work successfully fabricated all&#8208;organic diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs) with highly fluorinated nanospaces, wherein hydrophobic fluorine atoms are densely exposed on the void surfaces, by combining fluorine substituted triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) derivatives with tetrahedral tetrasulfonic acid. This d&#8208;POSs with a highly fluorinated nanospace significantly improved their water stability, retaining their crystal structure even when immersed in water over one week. Moreover, this highly hydrophobic and fluorinated nanospace adsorbs 160&#8197;mL(STP)/g of water vapor at Pe/P0=0.90; this is the first hydrophobic nanospace, which water molecules can enter, in an all&#8208;organic porous material. Furthermore, this highly fluorinated nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm) at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH. POSs with tailorable nanospaces may significantly advance the elucidation of the properties of specific &#8220;water&#8221; in pure hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Artificial Mitochondria Nanoarchitectonics via a Supramolecular Assembled Microreactor Covered by ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP synthesis against abiotic stress is achieved by biomimetic assembly microreactor based on phosphatase/Au clusters and ATP Synthase. Phosphatase is harnessed to generate both protons and Pi to support the synthesis of ATP under phosphorus&#8208;deficiency stress. Au clusters in the microreactor help proteins resist the destruction from ROS, and concurrently facilitate the photothermal&#8208;enhanced ATP synthesis.







Abstract
Abiotic stress tends to induce oxidative damage to enzymes and organelles that in turns hampers the phosphorylation process and decreases the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) productivity. Artificial assemblies can alleviate abiotic stress and simultaneously provide nutrients to diminish the oxidative damage. Here, we have integrated natural acid phosphatase (ACP) and ATP synthase with plasmonic Au clusters in a biomimetic microreactor. ACP immobilized on the Au clusters is harnessed to generate proton influx to drive ATP synthase and concurrently supply phosphate to improve phosphorus availability to combat phosphorus&#8208;deficiency stress. In tandem with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and the photothermal functionality of Au clusters, such an assembled microreactor exhibits an improved abiotic stress tolerance and achieves plasmon&#8208;accelerated ATP synthesis. This innovative approach offers an effective route to enhance the stress resistance of ATP synthase&#8208;based energy&#8208;generating systems, opening an exciting potential of these systems for biomimicking applications.

This study unveils novel intramolecular HAT reactions that produce azetidine, oxetane, and indoline derivatives. Facilitated by excited triplet&#8208;state carbon&#8208;centered biradicals, this process enables the 1,5&#8208;HAT reaction by suppressing the Norrish Type II cleavage reaction. It also pioneers unprecedented 1,6&#8208;HAT reactions initiated by excited triplet&#8208;state alkenes. Comprehensive experiments and DFT calculations support all findings.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction that efficiently yields azetidine, oxetane, and indoline derivatives through a mechanism resembling the carbon analogue of the Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction. This process is facilitated by excited triplet&#8208;state carbon&#8208;centered biradicals, enabling the 1,5&#8208;HAT reaction by suppressing the critical 1,4&#8208;biradical intermediates from undergoing the Norrish Type II cleavage reaction, and pioneering unprecedented 1,6&#8208;HAT reactions initiated by excited triplet&#8208;state alkenes. We demonstrate the synthetic utility and compatibility of this method across various functional groups, validated through scope evaluation, large&#8208;scale synthesis, and derivatization. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling, kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Multiple Chirality Switching of a Dye&#8208;Grafted Helical Polymer Film Driven by Acid &amp; Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer film with unique multiple chirality inversion properties has been efficiently prepared, based on a newly&#8208;designed pH&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, etc) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record five switchable chiral states and good reversibility.







Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, etc. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newly&#8208;designed acid &amp; base&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, etc.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three&#8208;state switching) and good reversibility. The creative exploration of such a multiple chirality switching material can not only promote the application progress of current chiroptical regulation technology, but also provide a significant guidance for the design and synthesis of future smart chiroptical switching materials and devices.

&lt;p&gt;A stimuli-responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newly-designed acid &amp;amp; base-sensitive dye-grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp;amp; base-driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three-state switching) and good reversibility. The creative exploration of such a multiple chirality switching material can not only promote the application progress of current chiroptical regulation technology, but also provide a significant guidance for the design and synthesis of future smart chiroptical switching materials and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ribosome&#8208;Free Translation up to Pentapeptides via Template Walk on RNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribosome&#8208;free translation of an RNA sequence to a pentapeptide has been achieved in the absence of any enzyme or ribozyme. Fidelity was demonstrated for each translation step. Our results show how efficient an early, primitive form of encoded synthesis can be.







Abstract
The origin of translation is one of the most difficult problems of molecular evolution. Identifying molecular systems that translate an RNA sequence into a peptide sequence in the absence of ribosomes and enzymes is a challenge. Recently, single&#8208;nucleotide translation via coupling of 5&#8242; phosphoramidate&#8208;linked amino acids to 2&#8242;/3&#8242;&#8208;aminoacyl transfer&#8208;NMPs, as directed by the sequence of an RNA template, was demonstrated for three of the four canonical nucleotides. How single&#8208;nucleotide translation could be expanded to include all four bases and to produce longer peptides without translocation along the template strand remained unclear. Using transfer strands of increasing length containing any of the four bases that interrogate adjacent positions along the template, we now show that pentapeptides can be produced in coupling reactions and subsequent hydrolytic release in situ. With 2&#8242;/3&#8242;&#8208;aminoacylated mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetranucleotides we thus show how efficient translation can be without biomacromolecules.

         <title>Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Coatings Engineered via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;phenolic network interfacial strategy is developed to form crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on diverse particle and planar substrates. This strategy allows for customized physicochemical properties (e.g., thickness, and morphology) of the supported crystalline MOFs, with potential for biomedical, agricultural, and energy applications.







Abstract
Crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered extensive attention owing to their highly ordered porous structure and physicochemical properties. However, their practical application often requires their integration with various substrates, which is challenging because of their weakly adhesive nature and the diversity of substrates that exhibit different properties. Herein, we report the use of amorphous metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings to facilitate the growth of crystalline MOF coatings on various particle and planar substrates. Crystalline MOFs with different metal ions and morphologies were successfully deposited on substrates (13 types) of varying sizes, shapes, and surface chemistries. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the coated crystalline MOFs (e.g., composition, thickness) could be tuned using different synthesis conditions. The engineered MOF&#8208;coated membranes demonstrated excellent liquid and gas separation performance, exhibiting a high H2 permeance of 63200&#8197;GPU and a H2/CH4 selectivity of 10.19, likely attributable to the thin nature of the coating (~180&#8197;nm). Considering the vast array of MOFs available (&gt;90,000) and the diversity of substrates, this work is expected to pave the way for creating a wide range of MOF composites and coatings with potential applications in diverse fields.

         <title>Modulating the Microenvironments of Robust Metal Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four robust metal hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of functional groups have been successfully constructed, which exhibit distinctly different photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, for the first time, highlighting the microenvironment modulation in HOFs plays an important role in regulating photocatalysis.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are outstanding candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, most of reported HOFs suffer from poor stability and photocatalytic activity in the absence of Pt cocatalyst. Herein, a series of metal HOFs (Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X, X=COOMe, Br, tBu and OMe) have been rationally constructed based on dinuclear cobalt complexes, which exhibit exceptional stability in the presence of strong acid (12&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (5&#8197;M NaOH) for at least 10&#8197;days. More impressively, by varying the &#8208;X groups of the dinuclear cobalt complexes, the microenvironment of Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X can be modulated, giving rise to obviously different photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#8722;X group sequence of &#8722;COOMe&gt;&#8722;Br&gt;&#8722;tBu&gt;&#8722;OMe. The optimized Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;COOMe shows H2 generation rate up to 12.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers and cocatalysts, which is superior to most reported Pt&#8208;assisted photocatalytic systems. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8722;X groups grafted on Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X possess different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, thus regulating the electronic structures of Co catalytic centres and proton activation barrier for H2 production, and leading to the distinctly different photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5&#8208;bistrifluoromethylphenyl (ArF) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram&#8208;scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p&#8208;block cations.







Abstract
Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Imaging of Precisely&#8208;Defined Redox and Reactive Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex interfacial reactions hinder understanding critical interfacial processes in electrochemical energy and separation systems. This mini&#8208;review explores an emerging field of interfacial engineering that enables preparing precisely defined interfaces and visualizing their reactivity using single&#8208;entity electrochemistry, thereby enabling the predictive understanding of energy&#8208;relevant redox and reactive electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Understanding the diverse electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces (EEIs) is a critical challenge to developing more efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. Establishing a predictive molecular&#8208;level understanding of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) is challenging due to the presence of multiple intertwined chemical and electrochemical processes occurring at battery electrodes. Similarly, chemical conversions in reactive electrochemical systems are often influenced by the heterogeneous distribution of active sites, surface defects, and catalyst particle sizes.

&lt;p&gt;The complex interfacial reactions hinder understanding critical interfacial processes in electrochemical energy and separation systems. This mini-review explores an emerging field of interfacial engineering that enables preparing precisely defined interfaces and visualizing their reactivity using single-entity electrochemistry, thereby enabling the predictive understanding of energy-relevant redox and reactive electrochemical systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the diverse electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode-electrolyte interfaces (EEIs) is a critical challenge to developing more efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. Establishing a predictive molecular-level understanding of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) is challenging due to the presence of multiple intertwined chemical and electrochemical processes occurring at battery electrodes. Similarly, chemical conversions in reactive electrochemical systems are often influenced by the heterogeneous distribution of active sites, surface defects, and catalyst particle sizes. In this mini review, we highlight an emerging field of interfacial science that isolates the impact of specific chemical species by preparing precisely-defined EEIs and visualizing the reactivity of their individual components using single-entity characterization techniques. We highlight the broad applicability and versatility of these methods, along with current state-of-the-art instrumentation and future opportunities for these approaches to address key scientific challenges related to batteries, chemical separations, and fuel cells. We establish that controlled preparation of well-defined electrodes combined with single entity characterization will be crucial to filling key knowledge gaps and advancing the theories used to describe and predict chemical and physical processes occurring at EEIs and accelerating new materials discovery for energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution State&#8208;Like Reactivity of a Flexible Crystalline Werner&#8208;Type Metal Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible crystalline Werner&#8208;type Cd(II) complex containing photoreactive ligands displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition type reactivity in the solid state, and associated unique properties including a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced development of porosity.







Abstract
Flexible crystalline solids exhibit unique properties in response to external stimuli like heat and light. However, challenges exist in developing crystalline solids that have similar degrees of flexibility as in solution. Herein, we report the preparation of the new flexible crystalline metal complex [Cd(CF3SO3)2(4&#8208;spy)4] (4&#8208;spy=4&#8208;styrylpyridine), which contains photoreactive 4&#8208;spy ligand. Unlike traditional solids, this metal complex displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition reactivity. Specifically, UV irradiation of the crystalline material leads to formation of the same diverse array of dimers and cis isomer that are generated by photoreaction in the solution state. In addition, the photoresponsive flexibility of the solid leads to a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced formation of pores. The origin of the solution state&#8208;like photoreactivity of the solid is related to properties of the Cd(II) cation and fluorinated CF3SO3 anion, and the multi&#8208;orientational arrangement of the 4&#8208;spy ligands.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Gradient Solution Deposition Amends Unfavorable Band Structure of Sb2(S,Se)3 Film for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal deposition applying gradient&#8208;temperature is able to manipulate anion distribution in Sb2(S,Se)3 film, reversing the unfavorable band structure and facilitating carrier transport. Combining with the improved morphology and defect properties, Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 10.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
Band structure of a semiconducting film critically determines the charge separation and transport efficiency. In antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells, the hydrothermal method has achieved control of band gap width of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film through tuning the atomic ratio of S/Se, resulting in an efficiency breakthrough towards 10&#8201;%. However, the obtained band structure exhibits an unfavorable gradient distribution in terms of carrier transport, which seriously impedes the device efficiency improvement. To solve this problem, here we develop a strategy by intentionally regulating hydrothermal temperature to control the chemical reaction kinetics between S and Se sources with Sb source. This approach enables the control over vertical distribution of S/Se atomic ratio in Sb2(S,Se)3 films, forming a favorable band structure which is conducive to carrier transport. Meanwhile, the adjusted element distribution not only ensures the uniformity of grain structure, but also increases the Se content of the films and suppress sulfur vacancy defects. Ultimately, the device delivers a high efficiency of 10.55&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. This study provides an effective strategy towards manipulating the element distribution in mixed&#8208;anion compound films prepared by solution&#8208;based method to optimize their optical and electrical properties.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for synthesizing thioesters from readily available aryl halides and carboxylic acids is here disclosed. This thiol&#8208;free protocol hinges on the direct excitation of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylthiourea and its multifaceted ability to act as the sulfur source, generate aryl radicals upon SET activation of halides, and trap them to in situ produce reactive isothiouronium ions.







Abstract
Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.

         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Carbooxygenation for the Construction of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Centers: Application to the Synthesis of Hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy to access hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones via i)&#8197;aerobic radical cyclization, ii)&#8197;allylation, and iii)&#8197;translactonization has been developed. The key to this sequence is the highly diastereoselective aerobic carbooxygenation based on the integration of endothermic intramolecular radical addition to geminally disubstituted alkenes with exothermic oxygenation to synthesize &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones.







Abstract
Strategic design for the construction of contiguous tetrasubstituted carbon centers represents a daunting challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational investigation aimed at developing catalytic aerobic carbooxygenation, involving the intramolecular addition of tertiary radicals to geminally disubstituted alkenes, followed by aerobic oxygenation. This reaction provides a straightforward route to various &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones, which can be readily transformed into hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones through allylation/translactonization. Computational analysis reveals that the key mechanistic foundation for achieving the developed aerobic carbooxygenation involves the design of endothermic (energetically uphill) C&#8722;C bond formation followed by exothermic (energetically downhill) oxygenation. Furthermore, we highlight a unique fluorine&#8208;induced stereoelectronic effect that stabilizes the endothermic stereodetermining transition state.

         <title>Construction of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Poly(heptazine Imide) Nanosheets via Hydrogen Bonds for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(heptazine imide) polymer photocatalyst, functionalized with hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs (HM&#8208;FLPs), is developed for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction. The HM&#8208;FLPs enable efficient separation of photogenerated charges, delocalization of electron clouds and selective CO2 deoxygenation in the ambient system.







Abstract
The creation of frustrated Lewis pairs on catalyst surface is an effective strategy for tuning CO2 activation. The critical step in the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs is the spatial effect of proximal Lewis acid&#8208;Lewis base pairs. Here, we demonstrate a facile surface functionalization methodology that enables hydrogen bonding between N and H atoms to mediate the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs in poly(heptazine imide), thereby increasing the propensity to activate CO2 molecules. Experimental and theoretical results show that the construction of active hydrogen bonding regions can facilitate the bending of CO2 molecules. Furthermore, the delocalization of electron clouds induced by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs can promote the heterolytic cleavage and photocatalytic conversion of CO2. This work highlights the potential of utilizing hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated strategy in heterogeneously photocatalytic activation of CO2 over polymer materials.

&lt;p&gt;A poly(heptazine imide) polymer photocatalyst, functionalized with hydrogen bonding-mediated frustrated Lewis pairs (HM-FLPs), is developed for highly efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. The HM-FLPs enable efficient separation of photogenerated charges, delocalization of electron clouds and selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; deoxygenation in the ambient system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of frustrated Lewis pairs on catalyst surface is an effective strategy for tuning CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. The critical step in the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs is the spatial effect of proximal Lewis acid-Lewis base pairs. Here, we demonstrate a facile surface functionalization methodology that enables hydrogen bonding between N and H atoms to mediate the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs in poly(heptazine imide), thereby increasing the propensity to activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Experimental and theoretical results show that the construction of active hydrogen bonding regions can facilitate the bending of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Furthermore, the delocalization of electron clouds induced by the hydrogen bonding-mediated frustrated Lewis pairs can promote the heterolytic cleavage and photocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work highlights the potential of utilizing hydrogen bonding-mediated strategy in heterogeneously photocatalytic activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over polymer materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interpretable Data&#8208;Driven Descriptors for Establishing the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a workflow that combines artificial&#8208;intelligence data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery method with density&#8208;functional theory calculations to find descriptors of catalytic activity of Ni&#8208;based MOFs in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The identified data&#8208;driven descriptors do not only guide the rational design of efficient MOF&#8208;based catalysts, but also provide physical insights overarching existing knowledge on physical factors governing OER catalysis by MOFs.







Abstract
The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Through an artificial&#8208;intelligence (AI) data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d&#8208;band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3&#8211;5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF&#8208;based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;Doping Enables Significant Suppression of Conformational Relaxation and Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay for Improved Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study found a solvent atmosphere&#8208;induced suppression of intermolecular and intramolecular nonradiative decay (interNR &amp; intraNR) of a perylene diimide (PDI) derivative, inspiring the development of alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to boost the photoluminescence (PL) of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR probing and long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor.







Abstract
Despite various efforts to optimize the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) performance of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives for bio&#8208;imaging, convenient and efficient strategies to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivatives in biological environment and the intrinsic mechanism studies are still lacking. Herein, we propose an alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR fluorescence imaging. The developed PDI derivative, OPE&#8208;PDI, shows much brighter in n&#8208;Hexane (HE) compared with that in other organic media, and the excited state dynamics investigation experimentally elucidates the solvent effect&#8208;induced suppression of intermolecular energy transfer and intramolecular nonradiative decay as the underlying mechanism for the fluorescence improvement. Theoretical calculations reveal the lowest reorganization energies of OPE&#8208;PDI in HE among various solvents, indicating the effectively suppressed conformational relaxation to support the strongest radiative decay. Inspired by this, an alkyl atmosphere mimicking HE is constructed by incorporating the octadecane into OPE&#8208;PDI&#8208;based nanoparticles, permitting up to 3&#8208;fold fluorescence improvement compared with the counterpart nanoparticles. Owing to the merits of high brightness, anti&#8208;photobleaching, and low biotoxicity for the optimal nanoparticles, they have been employed for probing and long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor. This work highlights a facile strategy for the fluorescence enhancement of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Doped Bismuth Nanosheet Catalyst for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Electrolyte&#8208;Free Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous solid electrolyte reactor efficiently produces pure formic acid (HCOOH) for over 100&#8197;h. The produced HCOOH can be utilized as chemical feedstock and in other applications.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO&#8722;) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal&#8208;doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high&#8208;purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal&#8208;doped Bi catalysts, Co&#8208;doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90&#8201;% HCOO&#8722; selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0&#8197;V at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co&#8208;doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72&#8201;% after a 100&#8208;hour operation under a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, generating 0.1&#8197;M HCOOH at 3.2&#8197;V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co&#8208;doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester and maleic anhydride was found to work as a catalyst for direct esterification of alcohol and carboxylic acid. The key to the unprecedented catalytic activity was the activation of carboxylic anhydride by adjacent boron, and the catalytic function through the cooperation of side chains would collect attention as the simple mimic of enzyme.







Abstract
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Activated Norbornenyl Esters&#8212;A Versatile Platform for Functional Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester is reported, which yielded an active ester&#8208;containing platform material that could undergo post&#8208;polymerization modification with primary amines under mild conditions. Modification with &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, and allylamine allowed preparation of nanoparticles, coated surfaces, and cross&#8208;linked networks, respectively.







Abstract
Elemental sulfur has shown to be a promising alternative feedstock for development of novel polymeric materials with high sulfur content. However, the utilization of inverse vulcanized polymers is restricted by the limitation of functional comonomers suitable for an inverse vulcanization. Control over properties and structure of inverse vulcanized polymers still poses a challenge to current research due to the dynamic nature of sulfur&#8208;sulfur bonds and high temperature of inverse vulcanization reactions. In here, we report for the first time the inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester (NB&#8208;PFPE), allowing for post&#8208;modification of inverse vulcanized polymers via amidation of reactive PFP esters to yield high sulfur content polymers under mild conditions. Amidation of the precursor material with three functional primary amines (&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, allylamine) was investigated. The resulting materials were applicable as sulfur containing poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles in aqueous environment. Cross&#8208;linked mercury adsorbents, sulfur surface coatings, and high&#8208;sulfur content networks with predictable thermal properties were achievable using aminopropyl trimethoxy silane and allylamine for post&#8208;polymerization modification, respectively. With the broad range of different amines available and applicable for post&#8208;polymerization modification, the versatility of poly(sulfur&#8208;random&#8208;NB&#8208;PFPE) as a platform precursor polymer for novel specialized sulfur containing materials was showcased.

         <title>Triindenotriphenylenes: Spin&#8208;Frustrated Triskelion Triradicals with Excellent Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped triindenotriphenylene triradicals with spin&#8208;frustrated doublet ground states are distinguished by good stability in air and a concise synthesis. The accessibility of several ionic forms of these hydrocarbons that possess strong infrared absorption bands was demonstrated.







Abstract
A triskelion&#8208;shaped triradical triindeno[1,2&#8208;a:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;g&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;m]triphenylen&#8208;7&#8208;yl (1) and its internally fused derivative (2) obtained by oxidative cyclization were prepared in a straightforward synthetic sequence. Both compounds were confirmed to be triradicals and to possess intramolecular antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between spins, displaying a spin&#8208;frustrated doublet ground state with doublet&#8208;quartet energy gaps of &#8722;0.14&#8197;kcal/mol for 1 and &#8722;0.06&#8197;kcal/mol for 2. Despite their open&#8208;shell character, they were sufficiently stable to be handled under ambient conditions on a timescale of days. Both compounds could be reversibly reduced to mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trianions and oxidized to 1+ and 22+, with strong NIR absorptions (1800 to over 3200&#8197;nm) observed for all open&#8208;shell ions.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu(I)&#8208;glutathione polymer supported on ZIF&#8208;8 is a robust catalyst for the efficient carboxylation of terminal alkynes and the cyclization of propargylamine with CO2 under atmospheric pressure and mild conditions with a wide range of substrates, converting them into high value&#8208;added chemicals, with strong positive synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst is reused at least 10&#8197;times without significant reduction in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT calculation, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10&#8197;times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>General In Situ Engineering of Carbon&#8208;Based Materials on Carbon Fiber for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ engineering strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of functional carbon fibers was developed by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. This strategy overcomes complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoids the delamination of the modification layer, enabling the fabrication and integration of neurochemical microsensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability.







Abstract
Developing real&#8208;time, dynamic, and in situ analytical methods with high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial for exploring biochemical processes in the brain. Although in vivo electrochemical methods based on carbon fiber (CF) microelectrodes are effective in monitoring neurochemical dynamics during physiological and pathological processes, complex post modification hinders large&#8208;scale productions and widespread neuroscience applications. Herein, we develop a general strategy for the in situ engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials to mass&#8208;produce functional CFs by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors, followed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. This strategy demonstrates exceptional universality and design flexibility, overcoming complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoiding the delamination of the modification layer. This simplifies the fabrication and integration of functional CF&#8208;based microelectrodes. Moreover, we design highly stable and selective H+, O2, and ascorbate microsensors and monitor the influence of CO2 exposure on the O2 content of the cerebral tissue during physiological and ischemia&#8208;reperfusion pathological processes.

         <title>Atomic Level&#8208;Macroscopic Structure&#8208;Activity of Inhomogeneous Localized Aggregates Enabled Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hybrid Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micelle&#8208;like structure electrolyte in macroscopic activity is proposed, featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates. Enabled by low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions, this electrolyte offers exceptional solubility, wide electrochemical window, low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) zinc ion conductivity in aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of hybrid aqueous electrolytes has significantly broadened the electrochemical and temperature ranges of aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the design principles for extreme operating conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically unveil the ternary interaction involving salt&#8208;water&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents and its intricate impacts on both the atomic&#8208;level and macroscopic structural features of the hybrid electrolytes. This highlights a distinct category of micelle&#8208;like structure electrolytes featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates, enabled by appropriate low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions. Remarkably, the electrolyte enables exceptional high solubility, accommodating up to 29.8&#8197;m zinc triflate within aqueous micelles. This configuration maintains an intra&#8208;micellar salt&#8208;in&#8208;water setup, allowing for a broad electrochemical window (up to 3.86&#8197;V), low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultralow&#8208;temperature zinc ion conductivity (1.58&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Building upon the unique nature of the inhomogeneous localized aggregates, this micelle&#8208;like electrolyte facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping, even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled Zn||PANI battery showcases an impressive capacity of 71.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extended lifespan of over 3000 cycles at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. This study opens up a promising approach in electrolyte design that transcends conventional local atomic solvation structures, broadening the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte concept.

         <title>Supramolecular Modifying Nafion with Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Functionalized Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Selective Proton Conduction.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate nanoclusters are used as supramolecular additives to precisely modify the ionic domains of Nafion, which can increase the proton conductivity and selectivity simultaneously. The resulting hybrid membranes show significantly enhanced power density in fuel cells and improved energy efficiency in vanadium flow batteries.







Abstract
Proton exchange membranes with high selectivity are urgently required in energy and electronic technologies. Although Nafion represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial proton exchange membrane material,it still suffers from the permeation of undesirable substances, like hydrogen in fuel cells and vanadium ions in redox flow batteries, due to the unmatched sizes between its ionic domains (3&#8211;5&#8197;nm) and these substances. In this work, we present a supramolecular modification strategy that simultaneously enhances the proton conductivity and selectivity of Nafion. We employ fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate (POMs) nanoclusters as supramolecular additives to modify Nafion via co&#8208;assembly. These POMs can precisely and robustly decorate at Nafion ionic domains, with their fluoroalkyl chains anchoring into the perfluorinated matrix while their inorganic clusters stay in the ionic regions. The hybrid membranes, with continuous proton hopping sites and nanoscale steric hindrance offered by POMs, exhibit a 56&#8201;% increase in proton conductivity and a 100&#8201;% improvement in proton/vanadium selectivity. This leads to significantly enhanced power density and energy efficiency in fuel cells and vanadium flow batteries, respectively. These results underscore the intriguing potential of molecular cluster additives in improving the functions of ion&#8208;conducting membranes.

         <title>Poly(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)&#8208;Capped Alloy and Core&#8208;Shell AuAg Bimetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) are used to covalently immobilize Au and Ag atoms to yield bimetallic random copolymers. Reduction of such polymers results in the formation of polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8211;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles whose structures are governed by the relative metal content in their corresponding metallopolymers. The application of these nanomaterials in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted considerable attention. While most efforts in the field have been devoted to the development of NHC&#8208;tethered monometallic NPs and enhancing their stabilities under various conditions, their bimetallic counterparts are rare in the literature. Herein, we demonstrate that the covalent immobilization of Au and Ag atoms on polymerized NHCs is a powerful method to access bimetallic AuAg NPs. In addition, we show that while AuAg alloy NPs are often obtained via this method, the use of bimetallic polymeric substrates with lower Ag content, relative to Au, results in the formation of core&#8211;shell NPs with Au core and Ag shell. Application of these nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated with all materials exhibiting electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates for the first time that while bimetallic poly(NHC&#8208;metal)s are viable substrates to access NHC&#8208;stabilized bimetallic NPs, careful adjustment of metal content in the polymeric substrates can finetune the microstructure of the resulting NPs, i.e. alloy vs. core&#8211;shell.

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the coupling of N&#8208;nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids.







Abstract
A strategy for transition metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl nitroso&#8208;carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The N&#8208;nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp3&#8722;Csp2 cross&#8208;coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

         <title>A Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Terarylene Hybrid: Visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II Absorption via Sequential Photochromic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photochromic molecule that consists of HABI and terarylene exhibits the sequential four&#8208;state photochromism. The delocalization of a &#960;&#8208;electron spin on the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system of the terarylene unit is crucially efficient in increasing the photosensitivity to NIR&#8208;II light. A recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer.







Abstract
A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi&#8208;state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four&#8208;state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8722;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring&#8208;closing reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system in the terarylene unit, leading to two terarylene radical molecules. The photogenerated terarylene radical further exhibits the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization reaction by UV irradiation. The delocalized &#960;&#8208;radical on the closed&#8208;ring form of the terarylene is efficient to enhance the photosensitivity to the NIR&#8722;I and &#8208;II region. Furthermore, a recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer as a structural isomer of the initial molecule. This is a consequence of the sequential hybrid photochromic system involving the HABI and terarylene units.

         <title>Modifying the Charge&#8208;Density of Tetrahedral Cobalt(II) Centers through Carbon&#8208;Layer Modulation Promotes C&#8208;H Activation in the Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction (PDH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer, which is generated from the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt sites, decreases the charge density of tetrahedral cobalt(II) centers, which makes the d&#8208;band center closer to the Fermi level, thus facilitating C&#8722;H activation in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
The electronic structure of active metal centers plays an indispensable role in regulating catalytic reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis, developing other metals as promoters to decorate electronic state is a common strategy, while non&#8208;metal component of carbon as electronic additives to regulate d&#8208;band center has rarely been studied in thermal&#8208;catalysis field. Herein, we report electron&#8208;deficient tetrahedral Co(II) (Td&#8208;cobalt(II)) centers through carbon&#8208;layer modulation for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is indicated that bifunctional sites of both Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and metallic&#8208;cobalt are designed, and the in situ generated carbon through the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt can cover the inactive metallic&#8208;cobalt and tailor d&#8208;band of active Td&#8208;cobalt(II) simultaneously. More importantly, the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer is proposed to decrease electron density of Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and make d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level, consequently promotes C&#8722;H activation in PDH reaction. This study provides new perspective for the utilization of inactive carbon as electronic promoters and unlocks new opportunity to fabricate efficient PDH and other heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence from Dual&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptors in a single molecule led to a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers that displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands, and single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized light (CPL) with |glum| of 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on those emitters exhibited single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with |gEL| of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and EQEmax of up to 15.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
The strategy of integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptors in a single molecule was proposed to construct white circularly polarized luminescence (WCPL) materials in this work. Consequently, a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers, namely (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ, were designed and synthesized, which displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands in solution and solid films with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.30, 0.33) and (0.33, 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ exhibited a high PLQY of up to 67&#8201;% in doped films and clear mirror&#8208;image WCPL signals with a |glum| value of 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. Moreover, white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) based on organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ as emitters were also achieved with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.37) and EQEmax of 4.7&#8201;%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level of white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters. By optimizing the device structure, warm WCPEL devices were further obtained with a |gEL| value of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;3, CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.48) and EQEmax of up to 15.6&#8201;%. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters.

         <title>P,N&#8208;Coordinating Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (NYPhos): A Ligand Platform for the Selective Monoarylation of Small Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel platform of P,N&#8208;coordinating phosphine ligands featuring an ylide substituent with an aminophosphonium group is reported. The ligands are easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and highly modular enabling a facile adjustment of their electronic and steric properties as well as the N&#8208;donor strength. This flexibility allowed the development of a mild and highly efficient protocol for the selective monoarylation of acetone, ketones, amides, ammonia and amines.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of small nucleophiles are of great interest, but challenging due to difficulties in selectivity control. Herein, we report the development of a new platform of P,N&#8208;ligands consisting of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines with aminophosphonium groups (NYPhos) to address this challenge. These phosphine ligands are easily accessible in a wide structural diversity with highly modular electronic and steric properties. Based on a family of 14 ligands the selective monoarylation of acetone as well as other challenging ketones and amides was accomplished with record&#8208;setting activities even for aryl chlorides at room temperature including late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug molecules. Moreover, ammonia and other small primary amines could be coupled at mild conditions. Isolation and structure analyses of palladium complexes within the catalytic cycle confirmed that the P,N&#8208;coordination mode is necessary to achieve the observed selectivities. It also demonstrated the facile adjustability of the N&#8208;donor strength, which is beneficial for the targeted design of tailored P,N&#8208;ligands for future applications.

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Intermediates of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SAzyme via Second&#8208;Shell Coordination for Selective Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from the refined structures of cytochromes P450 with tetrapyrrolic FeN4 active sites and sulfur&#8208;containing ligand, we report Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SAzyme with tunable second&#8208;shell sulfur&#8208;functionalization could regulate ROS production pathways. It was disclosed such functionalization enhanced electron transfer from active sites in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby determining the type of ROS in aerobic reactions.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation for single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), e.g., Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, is a key scientific issue that determines the activity, selectivity, and stability of aerobic reaction. However, the poor understanding of ROS formation mechanism on SAzymes greatly hampers their wider deployment. Herein, inspired by cytochromes P450 affording bound ROS intermediates in O2 activation, we report Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C containing the same FeN4 but with tunable second&#8208;shell coordination can effectively regulate ROS production pathways. Remarkably, compared to the control Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sample, the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalized Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C delivered a 2.4&#8208;fold increase of oxidase&#8208;like activity via the bound Fe=O intermediate. Conversely, free ROS (&#8901;O2&#8722;) release was significantly reduced after functionalization, down to only 17&#8201;% of that observed for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C. The detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalization significantly altered the electronic structure of FeN4 sites, leading to an increase of electron density at Fermi level. It enhanced the electron transfer from active sites to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the type of ROS in aerobic oxidation process. The proposed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with different second&#8208;shell anion were further applied to three aerobic oxidation reactions with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability.

         <title>Trace Fluorinated Carbon Dots Driven Li&#8208;Garnet Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pristine garnet surface exhibits poor wettability with Li metal, resulting in the formation of voids and gaps at the garnet/Li interface, which contributes to uneven electric field distribution and further leads to Li dendrite formation. A straightforward method is presented to construct a Li&#8208;FCD composite for garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries by the reaction between molten Li and a trace amount of FCDs (0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The Li&#8208;FCD composite transforms the weak interface connection into intimate contact with garnet and inhibits electron leakage, thereby enhancing Li+ transfer across the interface and promoting dendrite&#8208;free operation.







Abstract
Garnet solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) holds significant promise. However, the practical utilization has been seriously impeded by the poor contact of Li|garnet and electron leakage. Herein, one new type of garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state battery is proposed with high performance through the disparity in interfacial energy, induced by the reaction between trace fluorinated carbon dots (FCDs) and Li. The work of adhesion of Li|garnet is increased by the acquired Li&#8208;FCD composite, which facilitates an intimate Li|garnet interface with the promoted uniform Li+ deposition, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is further validated that a concentrated C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF component at the Li|garnet interface is spontaneously constructed, due to the significant disparity in interfacial energy between C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF|LLZTO and C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF|Li. Furthermore, The electron transport and Li dendrites penetration are effectively hindered by the formed Li2O and LiF. The Li&#8208;FCD|LLZTO|Li&#8208;FCD symmetrical cells demonstrate stable cycling performance for over 3000&#8197;hours at 0.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the LFP|garnet|Li&#8208;FCD full cell exhibits remarkable cycling performance (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C). Our research has revealed a novel approach to establish a dendrite&#8208;free Li|garnet interface, laying the groundwork for future advancements in garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries.

It is further validated that a concentrated C&#8722;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;LiF component at the Li|garnet interface is spontaneously constructed, due to the significant disparity in interfacial energy between C&#8722;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;LiF|LLZTO and C&#8722;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;LiF|Li. Furthermore, The electron transport and Li dendrites penetration are effectively hindered by the formed Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and LiF. The Li-FCD|LLZTO|Li-FCD symmetrical cells demonstrate stable cycling performance for over 3000&#8197;hours at 0.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the LFP|garnet|Li-FCD full cell exhibits remarkable cycling performance (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C). Our research has revealed a novel approach to establish a dendrite-free Li|garnet interface, laying the groundwork for future advancements in garnet-based solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antifouling Asymmetric Block Copolymer Nanofilms via Freestanding Interfacial Polymerization for Efficient and Sustainable Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This freestanding IP fabrication approach eventually endows the resultant asymmetric BCP nanofilms with far higher PEG brushes grafting ratio and highly denser hydrophilic PEG layer compared to conventional surface post&#8208;modification, leading to not only superior water permeability and ion selectivity, but also extraordinary antifouling capability far beyond commercial polyamide membranes in water purification.







Abstract
Membrane materials that resist nonspecific or specific adsorption are urgently required in widespread practical applications, such as water purification, food processing, and life sciences. In water purification, inevitable membrane fouling not only limits membrane separation performance, leading to a decline in both permeance and selectivity, but also remarkably increases operation requirements, and augments extra maintenance costs and higher energy consumption. In this work, we report a freestanding interfacial polymerization (IP) fabrication strategy for in situ creation of asymmetric block copolymer (BCP) nanofilms with antifouling properties, greatly outperforming the conventional surface post&#8208;modification approaches. The resultant free&#8208;standing asymmetric BCP nanofilms with highly&#8208;dense, highly&#8208;hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) brushes on one side, can be readily formed via a typical IP process of a well&#8208;defined double&#8208;hydrophilic BCP composed of a highly&#8208;efficient antifouling PEG block and a membrane&#8208;forming multiamine block. The asymmetric BCP nanofilms have been applied for efficient and sustainable natural water purification, demonstrating extraordinary antifouling capabilities accompanied with superior separation performance far beyond commercial polyamide nanofiltration membranes. The antifouling behaviors of asymmetric BCP nanofilms derived from the combined effect of the hydration layer, electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were further elucidated by water flux and fouling resistance in combination with all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This work opens up a new avenue for the large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost creation of broad&#8208;spectrum, asymmetric membrane materials with diverse functional &#8220;defect&#8208;free&#8221; surfaces in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Complex of Cucurbit[7]uril with Diketopyrrolopyrole Dye: Fluorescence Boost, Biolabeling and Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright and stable assembly of cucurbit[7]uril as a host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) as a guest was functionalized. In conjugates with proteins, DPP dye shows up to 12&#8208;fold emission gain upon addition of CB7. In two&#8208;color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595&#8197;nm or 655&#8197;nm STED depletion lasers, the presence of CB7 is recommended for improving brightness and image quality. With CB7, DPP dye becomes cell&#8208;permeable.







Abstract
New photostable and bright supramolecular complexes based on cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) guest dyes having two positively charged 4&#8208;(trimethylammonio)phenyl groups were prepared and characterized. The dye core displays large Stokes shift (in H2O, abs./emission max. 480/550&#8197;nm; &#1013;~19&#8201;000, &#964;fl&gt;4 ns), strong binding with the host (~560&#8197;nM Kd) and a linker affording fluorescence detection of bioconjugates with antibody and nanobody. Combination of protein&#8208;functionalized DPP dye with CB7 improves photostability and affords up to 12&#8208;fold emission gain. Two&#8208;color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595&#8197;nm or 655&#8197;nm STED depletion lasers shows that the presence of CB7 not only leads to improved brightness and image quality, but also results in DPP becoming cell&#8208;permeable.

         <title>Enhanced UV Nonlinear Optical Properties in Layered Germanous Phosphites through Functional Group Sequential Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide nonlinear optical crystal, GeHPO3, featuring a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, has been successfully synthesized through an innovative strategy of sequential functional group construction. It achieves an optimal balance in the UV solar&#8208;blind region, demonstrating extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation&#8212;10.3&#8197;times that of KDP&#8212;with a short UV absorption edge at 211&#8197;nm and moderate birefringence measured at 0.062 at 546&#8197;nm.







Abstract
This study pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals through functional groups sequential construction, effectively addressing the inherent trade&#8208;offs among broad transmittance, enhanced second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and optimal birefringence. We have developed two innovative van der Waals layered germanous phosphites: GeHPO3, the first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide NLO crystal which exhibits a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, and K(GeHPO3)2Br, distinguished by its exceptional birefringence and graphene&#8208;like structure. Significantly, GeHPO3 exhibits a remarkable array of NLO properties, including the highest SHG coefficient recorded among all NLO crystals for phase&#8208;matching and generating 266&#8197;nm coherent light via quadruple frequency conversion. It delivers a potent SHG intensity, surpassing KH2PO4 (KDP) by 10.3&#8197;times at 1064&#8197;nm and &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 by 1.3&#8197;times at 532&#8197;nm, complemented by a distinct UV absorption edge at 211&#8197;nm and moderate birefringence of 0.062 at 546&#8197;nm. Comprehensive theoretical analysis links these exceptional characteristics to the unique NLO&#8208;active GeO34&#8722; units and the distinctive, highly ordered layered structures. Our findings deliver essential experimental insights into the development of Ge(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic materials and present a strategic blueprint for engineering structure&#8208;driven functional materials with customized properties.

         <title>Strained Au skin on Mesoporous Intermetallic AuCu3 Nanocoral for Electrocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia across a Wide Concentration Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered mesoporous intermetallic AuCu3 nanocoral with ultrathin strained Au&#8208;skin layer (meso&#8208;i&#8208;AuCu3@ultra&#8208;Au) was synthesized as an efficient and concentration&#8208;universal NitRR catalyst. The unique structure of catalyst not only offers a substantial exposed active area and enhances electron/mass transfer kinetics, but also effectively modulates the surface electronic structure to optimize the adsorption behavior of different intermediates (*NOx&#8722; and *H) and facilitate the hydrogenation process over a wide concentration range.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) uses nitrate from wastewater, offering a hopeful solution for environmental issues and ammonia production. Yet, varying nitrate levels in real wastewater greatly affect NitRR, slowing down its multi&#8208;step process. Herein, a multi&#8208;strategy approach was explored through the design of ordered mesoporous intermetallic AuCu3 nanocorals with ultrathin Au skin (meso&#8208;i&#8208;AuCu3@ultra&#8208;Au) as an efficient and concentration&#8208;versatile catalyst for NitRR. The highly penetrated structure, coupled with the compressive stress exerted on the skin layer, not only facilitates rapid electron/mass transfer, but also effectively modulates the surface electronic structure, addressing the concentration&#8208;dependent challenges encountered in practical NitRR process. As expected, the novel catalyst demonstrates outstanding NitRR activities and Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 95&#8201;% across a real and widespread concentration range (10&#8211;2000&#8197;mM). Notably, its performance at each concentration matched or exceeded that of the best&#8208;known catalyst designed for that concentration. Multiple operando spectroscopies unveiled the catalyst concurrently optimized the adsorption behavior of different intermediates (adsorbed *NOx and *H) while expediting the hydrogenation steps, leading to an efficient overall reduction process. Moreover, the catalyst also displays promising potential for use in ammonia production at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities and in conceptual zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries, serving trifunctional nitrate conversion, ammonia synthesis and power supply.

Moreover, the catalyst also displays promising potential for use in ammonia production at industrial-relevant current densities and in conceptual zinc-nitrate batteries, serving trifunctional nitrate conversion, ammonia synthesis and power supply.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Micro/meso&#8208;porous Double&#8208;shell Hollow Carbon Spheres through Spatially Confined Pyrolysis for Supercapacitors and Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy storage in supercapacitors and hybrid zinc ion capacitors (ZIC) using porous carbon materials offers a promsing alternative method for clean energy solutions. The unique combination of hierarchical porous structure and nitrogen doping in these materials has demonstrated significant capacity for energy storage. Nevertheless, the full potential of these materials, particularly the relationship between pore structure configuration and performance, remains underexplored. Herein, a confined pyrolysis strategy based on the polymerization characteristics of polydopamine (PDA) was developed to construction of hollow carbon spheres with microporous/mesoporous dual shell structure. The depth of micropores and cavity can be controlled by adjusting the duration of heat treatment and hydrothermal treatment, in accordance with the decomposition and polymerization characteristics of PDA. Due to the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and ZIC is established. Through optimizing the ion transport capacity of carbon spheres and considering the influence of its internal cavity structure on energy storage, the resulting carbon spheres exhibit high specific capacitance of 389 F g&#8208;1 in supercapacitor and specific capacitance of 260 F g&#8722;1 and excellent stability with 99.3% retention after 30000 chare/discharge cycles in ZIC.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Deficiency is More Important than Conductivity in C&#8722;N Coupling for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species. The electron&#8208;deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C&#8722;N coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool&#8217;s ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host&#8217;s mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast and Coherent Dynamics in a Solvent Switchable "Pink Box" Perylene Diimide Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene diimide (PDI) dimers and higher aggregates are key components in organic molecular photonics and photovoltaic devices, supporting singlet fission and symmetry breaking charge separation. Detailed understanding of their excited states is thus important. This has proven challenging because interchromophoric coupling is a strong function of dimer architecture. Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. Spectral analysis resolves the different coupling strengths, which are consistent with solvent dependent changes in dimer conformation. The strongly coupled conformer forms an excimer within 300 fs. The low&#8208;frequency Raman active modes recovered from two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectra reveal frequencies characteristic of exciton coupling. These are assigned to modes modulating the coupling from the corresponding DFT calculations. Further analysis reveals a time dependent frequency during excimer formation. Analysis of two&#8208;dimensional &#8220;beatmaps&#8221; reveals features in the coupled dimer which are not predicted by the displaced harmonic oscillator model and are assigned to vibronic coupling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;biological photosynthesis combines synthetic photosensitizers with microbial catalysts to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals from CO2. However, the inefficient transfer of photoexcited electrons to microbes leads to limited CO2 utilization, restricting the catalytic performance of such biohybrid assemblies. Here, we introduce a biological engineering solution to address the inherently sluggish electron uptake mechanism of a methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri), by coculturing it with an electron transport specialist, Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400), an adapted strain rich with multiheme c&#8208;type cytochromes (c&#8208;Cyts) and electrically conductive protein filaments (e&#8208;PFs) made of polymerized c&#8208;Cyts with enhanced capacity for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Integration of this M. barkeri&#8208;KN400 co&#8208;culture with a synthetic photosensitizer, carbon nitride, demonstrates that c&#8208;Cyts and e&#8208;PFs, emanating from live KN400, transport photoexcited electrons efficiently from the carbon nitride to M. barkeri for methanogenesis with remarkable long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. The demonstrated cooperative interaction between two microbes via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and the photosensitizer to assemble a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst introduces an ecosystem engineering strategy in photocatalysis to drive sustainable chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.</dc:description>

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Gradient Interface for High&#8208;Rate PEO&#8208;based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based all solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are strongly hindered by the fast dendrite growth at the Li metal/electrolyte interface, especially under large rates. The above issue stems from the suboptimal interfacial chemistry and poor Li+ transport kinetics during cycling. Herein, a SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SCG&#8208;SEI) of LixSny/LiF&#8208;Li2O is in&#8208;situ formed. The superior ionic LiF&#8208;Li2O rich upper layer (17.1 nm) possesses high interfacial energy and fast Li+ diffusion channels, wherein lithiophilic LixSny alloy layer (8.4 nm) could highly reduce the nucleation overpotential with lower diffusion barrier and promote rapid electron transportation for reversible Li+ plating/stripping. Simultaneously, the insoluble SnF2&#8208;coordinated PEO promotes the rapid Li+ ion transport in the bulk phase. As a result, an over 46.7 and 3.5 times improvements for lifespan and critical current density of symmetrical cells are achieved, respectively. Furthermore, LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLMBs deliver a recorded cycling performance at 5 C (over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.0%). More importantly, impressive electrochemical performances and safety tests with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and pouch cell with LiFePO4, even under extreme conditions (i.e., 100 &#8451;), are also demonstrated, reconfirmed the importance of lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient interfacial chemistry in the design of high&#8208;rate ASSLMBs for safety applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;axial Self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray Detection by a Two&#8208;dimensional Biaxial Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, however, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23 V and 0.22 V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2 nGyair s&#8722;1 and 19.4 nGyair s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter&#8212;a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement&#8212;was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100 cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.</dc:description>

         <title>The Formation Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Carbonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs), as a kind of zero&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, have been widely synthesized by bottom&#8208;up methods from various precursors. However, the formation mechanism is still unclear and controversial, which also brings difficulty to the regulation of structures and properties. Only some tentative formation processes were postulated by analyzing the products obtained at different reaction times and temperatures. Here, the effect of crosslinking on the formation of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is explored. Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the driving force for the formation of CPDs. Under hydrothermal synthesis, the precursors are initiated to polymerize and crosslink. The crosslinking brings higher hydrophobicity to generate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation, which promotes dehydration and carbonization resulting in the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are also revealed. Moreover, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to support this formation mechanism. This concept of CINC will bring light to the formation process of CPDs, as well as facilitate the regulation of CPDs&#8217; size and photoluminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydroboration of C&#8722;C Single Bonds without Transition&#8208;metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds presents a fundamental challenge in the chemical industry. Previously, only catalytic systems utilizing precious metals Ir and Rh, in conjunction with N&#8208; and P&#8208; ligands, could achieve this, ensuring bond cleavage and selectivity. In sharp contrast, we discovered an unprecedented and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds. This methodology is transition&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;free and surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate versatility, or yields. In addition, our system tolerates various functional groups such as Ar&#8722;X (X = halides), heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, amides, nitro, nitriles, and C=C double bonds, which are typically susceptible to hydroboration in the presence of transition metals. As a result, a diverse range of &#947;&#8208;boronated amines with varied structures and functions has been readily obtained. Experimental mechanistic studies, density functional theory (DFT), and intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) calculations unveiled a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and hydride&#8208;shift reaction pathway. The carbonyl group of the amide suppresses dehydrogenation between the free N&#8722;H and hydroborane. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amide facilitates the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in cyclopropanes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 TxtE Model System with Mechanistic and Theoretical Evidence for a Heme Peroxynitrite Active Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytochrome P450 homolog, TxtE, efficiently catalyzes the direct and regioselective aromatic nitration of the indolyl moiety of L&#8208;tryptophan to 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, using nitric oxide&#160;and dioxygen&#160;as co&#8208;substrates. Pathways for such direct and selective nitration of heteroaromatic motifs present platforms for engineering new nitration biocatalysts for pharmacologically beneficial targets, among a medley of other pivotal industrial applications. Precise mechanistic details concerning this pathway are only weakly understood, albeit a heme iron(III)&#8208;peroxynitrite active species has been postulated. To shed light on this unique reaction landscape, we investigated the indole nitration pathway of a series of biomimetic ferric heme superoxide mimics, [(Por)FeIII(O2&#8211;&#8226;)], in the presence of NO. Therein, our model systems gave rise to three distinct nitroindole products, including 4&#8208;nitroindole, the product analogous to that obtained with TxtE. Moreover, 15N and 18O isotope labeling studies, along with meticulously designed control experiments lend credence to a heme peroxynitrite active nitrating agent, drawing close similarities to the tryptophan nitration mechanism of TxtE. All organic and inorganic reaction components have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods. Theoretical investigation into several mechanistic possibilities deem a unique indolyl radical based reaction pathway as the most energetically favorable, products of which, are in excellent agreement with experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolytic Depolymerization&#160;of Polyolefins Catalyzed by Zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes are the most&#8208;produced plastic waste globally, yet are difficult to convert into useful products due to their unreactivity. Pyrolysis is a practical method for large&#8208;scale treatment of mixed, contaminated plastic, allowing for their conversion into industrially&#8208;relevant petrochemicals. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), despite their tremendous utility in heterogenous catalysis, have been overlooked for polyolefin depolymerization due to their perceived thermal instabilities and inability of polyethylenes and polypropylenes to penetrate their pores. Herein, we demonstrate the viability of UiO&#8208;66 MOFs containing coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated zirconia nodes, as effective catalysts for pyrolysis that significantly enhances the yields of valuable liquid and gas hydrocarbons, whilst halving the amounts of residual solids produced. Reactions occur on the Lewis&#8208;acidic UiO&#8208;66 zirconia nodes, without the need for noble metals, and yields aliphatic product distributions distinctly different from the aromatic&#8208;rich hydrocarbons from zeolite catalysis. We also demonstrate the first unambiguous characterization of polyolefin penetration into UiO&#8208;66 pores at pyrolytic temperatures, allowing access to the abundant Zr&#8208;oxo nodes within the MOF interior for efficient C&#8208;C cleavage. Our work highlights the potential of MOFs as highly&#8208;designable heterogeneous catalysts for depolymerization of plastics which can complement conventional catalysts in reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180% coulombic efficiency and more than 90% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 100 hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130 mA cm&#8208;2 at a voltage of only 2.1 V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough, yet Rigid and Healable Supramolecular Polymers with Variable Stiffness for Multimodal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Variable stiffness materials have shown considerable application in soft robotics. However, previously reported materials often struggle to reconcile high stiffness, stretchability, toughness, and self&#8208;healing ability, because of the inherently conflicting requisite of these properties in molecular design. Herein, we propose a novel strategy that involves incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs capable of from strong crosslinking sites into a dense and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to construct rigid self&#8208;healing polymers with tunable stiffness and excellent toughness. To demonstrate these distinct features, the polymer was employed to serve as the strain&#8208;regulation layers within a fiber&#8208;reinforced pneumatic actuator (FPA). The exceptional synergy between the configuration versatility of FPA and the dynamic molecular behavior of the supramolecular polymers equips the actuator with simultaneous improvement in motion dexterity, multimodality, loading capacity, robustness, and durability. Additionally, the concept of integrating high dexterity at both macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale is prospective to inspire the design of intelligent yet robust devices across various domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Aldehyde End&#8208;Capped Degradable Polyethylenes from Hydrogen&#8208;Controlled Ethylene/CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in&#8208;chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen&#8208;controlled E/CO non&#8208;alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non&#8208;alternating in&#8208;chain keto groups (1.0&#8208;9.3 mol%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195 kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer&#8217;s molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non&#8208;alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non&#8208;alternating structure (&gt; 99%) for the keto&#8208;PE. The dispersed incorporation of in&#8208;chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel resonance&#8208;assisted self&#8208;doping mechanism has been demonstrated in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. The new class of compounds has a unique structure incorporating acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups into the ladder&#8208;type cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diimine core, enabling efficient proton transfer and self&#8208;doping without the need for external dopants. Mechanistic studies and computational studies confirm the open&#8208;shell, zwitterionic nature of the self&#8208;doped state and the significant role played by the dielectric environment. This new self&#8208;doping mechanism allows for higher stability and durability in the material's electronic performance. The self&#8208;doped form retains durability under harsh conditions and maintains its properties over extended periods of time.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Absorbance&#8208;Activated Droplet Sorting for Engineering Aldehyde Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the commercial use of biocatalysts, transitioning from energy&#8208;intensive traditional chemistries to more sustainable methods. Current enzyme engineering techniques, such as directed evolution, require the generation and testing of large mutant libraries to identify optimized variants. Unfortunately, conventional screening methods are unable to screen such large libraries in a robust and timely manner. Droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems have emerged as a powerful high&#8208;throughput tool for library screening at kilohertz rates. Unfortunately, almost all reported systems are based on fluorescence detection, restricting their use to a limited number of enzyme types that naturally convert fluorogenic substrates or require the use of surrogate substrates. To expand the range of enzymes amenable to evolution using droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems, we present an absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorter that allows of droplet sorting at kilohertz rates without the need for optical monitoring of the microfluidic system. To demonstrate the utility of the sorter, we rapidly screen a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library towards D&#8208;glyceraldehyde using a NADH mediated coupled assay that generates WST&#8208;1 formazan as the colorimetric product. We successfully identify a variant with a 51% improvement in catalytic efficiency and a significant increase in overall activity across a broad substrate spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(III) Auracycles Featuring C(sp3)&#8208;Au&#8208;C(sp2) Bonds: Synthesis and Mechanistic Insights into the Cycloauration Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel set of alkyl&#8208;gold(III) complexes is synthesized and their reactivity is explored. These species are susceptible to undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H auration under mild conditions. Experimental kinetics, Hammett analysis, activation parameters and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) suggest that the process occurs via electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) wherein the formation of a &#960;&#8208;complex might precede the formation of a Wheland intermediate.







Abstract
The direct auration of arenes is a key step in numerous gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Although reported more than 100&#8197;years ago, understanding of its underlying mechanism has been hampered by the difficulties in the isolation of relevant intermediates given the propensity of gold(III) species to undergo reductive elimination. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of a new family of intriguing zwitterionic [C(sp3)^C(sp2)]&#8208;auracyclopentanes, as well as of their alkyl&#8208;gold(III) precursors and demonstrate their value as mechanistic probes to study the C(sp2)&#8208;Au bond&#8208;forming event. Experimental investigations employing Kinetic Isotope Effects (KIE), Hammett plot, and Eyring analysis provided important insights into the formation of the auracycle. The data suggest a SEAr mechanism wherein the slowest step might be the &#960;&#8208;coordination between the arene and the gold(III) center, en route to the Wheland intermediate. We also show that these auracyclopentanes can work as catalysts in several gold&#8208;promoted transformations.

         <title>Altering the CO2 Electroreduction Pathways Towards C1 or C2+ Products via Engineering the Strength of Interfacial Cu&#8722;O Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the CO2RR pathways can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O&#8208;containing organic species. The C6O6&#8722;Cu catalysts with strong Cu&#8722;O bonds shows a dominant C1 pathway, while the C4O4&#8722;Cu with weaker Cu&#8722;O bonds shows enhanced capability of C&#8722;C coupling for C2+ production.







Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value&#8208;added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O&#8208;containing organic species (squaric acid (H2C4O4) and cyclohexanehexaone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu&#8722;O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6&#8722;Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4&#8722;Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu&#8208;atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8&#8201;% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C&#8722;C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10&#8197;h with a high current density of 205.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE, i.e., is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metabolism&#8208;inspired artificial system designed to respond to multiple stimuli, operating within an integrated network of mechanistically distinct reactions. Our approach enables the efficient performance of multi&#8208;stage processes using three simple starting materials, controlled by specific triggers, and catalysed by a multifunctional PdII/PtII complex, leading to the preferential synthesis of ten products.







Abstract
Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains thus far beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions&#8212;cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials&#8212;terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;catalysis Mechanism Elucidation by Tracking Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide with In&#8208;situ EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory of photocatalysis or the screening charge effect of electrochemical catalysis. Due to the formation of different intermediate active&#8208;species during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and piezo&#8208;catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB&#8208;OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo&#8208;catalysis over BOB&#8208;OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo&#8208;catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo&#8208;catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis.

Due to the formation of different intermediate active-species during two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro- and photo-catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro-, photo-, and piezo-catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB-OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo-catalysis over BOB-OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo-catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo-catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo-catalysis rather than electro-catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo-catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on&#160;Different CeO2&#160;Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5% and 97.6%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4 &#181;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetracationic Cobalt 3,4&#8208;pyridinoporphyrazine for Direct CO2 to Methanol Conversion Escaping the CO Intermediate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donnors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>MOFite: A High&#8208;Density Lithiophilic and Scalable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Anode for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an anode material that has better performance efficiency than commercial graphite while keeping the features of economic scalability and environmental safety is highly desirable yet challenging. MOFs are a promising addition to the ongoing efforts, however, the relatively poor performance, chemical instability, and large&#8208;scale economic production of efficiency&#8208;proven pristine MOFs restrict their utility in real&#8208;life energy storage applications. Furthermore, hierarchical porosity for lucid mass diffusion, high&#8208;density lithiophilic sites are some of the structural parameters for improving the electrode performance. Herein, we have demonstrated the potential of economically scalable salicylaldehydate 3D&#8208;conjugated&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8208;Tp) as a high&#8208;performance anode in Li&#8208;ion batteries: the anode&#8208;specific capacity achieved up to 1447 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and 89% of cyclic stability after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1.for pristine MOF. More importantly, incorporating 10% Fe&#8208;Tp doping in commercial graphite (MOFite) significantly enhanced lithium storage, doubling capacitance after 400 cycles. It signifies the potential practical utility of Fe&#8208;Tp as a performance booster for commercial anode material.</dc:description>

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium&#8208;based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes for High&#8208;performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries with Eutectic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium&#8208;based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in&#8208;situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple&#8208;redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+ and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200 mA h g&#8208;1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal&#8208;based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of the V&#8208;PBA cathode, a high concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte (4.5 M ZnSO4 + 3 M Zn(OTf)2), and a water&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte (5.55 M glucose + 3 M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.</dc:description>
