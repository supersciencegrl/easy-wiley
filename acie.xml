         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Endocyclic 1&#8208;Azaallyl Anions: Concise Synthesis of Unprotected Enantioenriched cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diarylpiperidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized through an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions. These intermediates are generated in situ by the deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines, precursors that are readily prepared in two operations from simple piperidines. An asymmetric version of this reaction with (2R, 3R)&#8208;iPr&#8208;BI&#8208;DIME as the ligand provides products in moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biselenophene Imide: Enabling Polymer Acceptor with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shortage of narrow bandgap polymer acceptors with high electron mobility is the major bottleneck for developing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, we synthesize a distannylated electron&#8208;deficient biselenophene imide monomer (BSeI&#8208;Tin) with high purity/reactivity, affording an excellent chance to access acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type polymer acceptors. Copolymerizing BSeI&#8208;Tin with dibrominated monomer Y5&#8208;Br, the resulting A&#8208;A polymer PY5&#8208;BSeI shows a higher molecular weight, narrower bandgap, deeper&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels and larger electron mobility than the donor&#8211;acceptor type counterpart PY5&#8208;BSe. Consequently, the PY5&#8208;BSeI&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.77% with a high short&#8208;circuit current of 24.93 mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 75.83%. This efficiency is much higher than that (10.70%) of the PY5&#8208;BSe&#8208;based devices. Our study demonstrates that BSeI is a promising building block for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors and stannylation of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks offers excellent synthons to develop A&#8208;A type polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs and even beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>The Keto&#8208;Switched Photocatalysis of Reconstructed Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The keto&#8208;switched photocatalysis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient H2 evolution was reported for the first time by engineering at a molecular level the local structure and component of the skeletal building blocks. A series of imine&#8208;linked BT&#8208;COFs were synthesized by the Schiff&#8208;base reaction of 1, 3, 5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde with diamines to demonstrate the structural reconstruction of enol to keto configurations by alkaline catalysis. It was well&#8208;identified that the keto groups of the skeletal building blocks were served as active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons were emitted to Pt nanoparticles (NPs) across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer. The characterization results, together with density functional theory calculations, indicated clearly that the formation of keto&#8208;injectors not only made the conduction band level more negative, but also led to an inhomogeneous charge distribution in the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular building blocks to form a strong intramolecular built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, the visible light photocatalysis of TP&#8208;COFs&#8208;1 with one keto group in the skeletal building blocks was successfully enabled and achieved an impressive H2 evolution rate as high as 0.96 mmol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1. Also, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of the reconstructed BT&#8208;COFs&#8208;2 and &#8208;3 with two and three keto&#8208;injectors were significantly enhanced by the alkaline post&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Chiral Hybrid Antimony Chlorides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials are ideal for information anti&#8208;countering applications, but the best&#8208;performing materials have not yet been identified. This work presents enantiomorphic hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (1) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (2) showing mirror&#8208;imaged CPL activity with a dissymmetry factor of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8208;3. Interestingly, the DMF&#8208;induced structural transformation is realized to obtain non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#183;DMF (3) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#183;DMF (4) upon exposure to DMF vapor. The transformation process is reversed upon heating. DFT calculations showed that the DMF&#8208;induced&#8208;quenched&#8208;luminescence is attributed to the intersection of the ground and excited state curves on the configuration coordinates. Unexpectedly, the nanocrystals of the chiral antimony halides 1 and 2 were prepared and indicate the excellent solution process performance. The reversible PL and CPL switching gives the system applications in information technology, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption&#8208;decryption, and logic gates.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mn2+&#8211;NO and NO&#8211;NO Distance Measurements Reveal That Catalytic Asymmetry Regulates Alternating Access&#160;
in an ABC Transporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters shuttle diverse substrates across biological membrane. Transport is often achieved through a transition between an inward&#8208;facing (IF) and an outward&#8208;facing (OF) conformation of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Asymmetric nucleotide&#8208;binding sites (NBSs) are present among several ABC subfamilies and their functional role remains elusive. Here we addressed this question using concomitant NO&#8211;NO, Mn2+&#8211;NO, and Mn2+&#8211;Mn2+&#160;pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy of TmrAB in a time resolved manner. This type&#160;IV ABC transporter undergoes a reversible transition in the presence of ATP with a significantly faster forward transition. The impaired degenerate NBS stably binds Mn2+&#8211;ATP and Mn2+&#160;is preferentially released at the active consensus NBS. ATP hydrolysis at the consensus NBS considerably accelerates reverse transition. Both NBSs fully open during each conformational cycle and the degenerate NBS may regulate the kinetics of this process.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8211;H Carbonylation of Light and Heavy Hydrocarbons with Carbon Monoxide via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalysis in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their abundance in organic molecules, considerable limitations still exist in synthetic methods that target the direct C&#8211;H functionalization at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. This is even more the case for light alkanes, which bear some of the strongest C&#8211;H bonds known in Nature, requiring extreme activation conditions that are not tolerant to most organic molecules. To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C&#8211;H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.</dc:description>

Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas-liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose the first regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and chemoselective late&#8208;stage (hetero)aryl C&#8211;H bond cyclopropenylation with cyclopropenium cations (CPCs). The process is fast, operationally simple and showed an excellent functional group tolerance in&#160;densely&#8208;functionalized drug molecules, natural products, agrochemicals and fluorescent dyes.&#160;Moreover, we discovered that the installation of the cyclopropene ring in drug molecules could not only be used to shield against metabolic instability but also as a synthetic tool to&#160;reach medicinally&#8208;relevant&#160;sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds&#160;exploiting&#160;the highly&#8208;strained nature of the cyclopropene ring with known transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Sustainable Metal&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Materials, Electrochemistry and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the natural abundance of iodine, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainability, metal&#8208;iodine batteries are competitive for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density, and large power density. However, the inherent properties of iodine such as electronic insulation and shuttle behavior of soluble iodine species affect negatively rate performance, cyclability, and self&#8208;discharge behavior of metal&#8208;iodine batteries, while the dendrite growth and metal corrosion on the anode side brings potential safety hazards and inferior durability. These problems of metal&#8208;iodine system still exist and need to be solved urgently. Herein, we summarize the research progress of metal&#8208;iodine batteries in the past decades. Firstly, the classification, design strategy and reaction mechanism of iodine electrode are briefly outlined. Secondly, the current development and protection strategy of conventional metal anodes in metal&#8208;iodine batteries are highlighted, and some potential anode materials and their design strategies are proposed. Thirdly, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues for realizing next&#8208;generation iodine&#8208;based energy storage systems. Therefore, the aim of this review is to promote the development of metal&#8208;iodine batteries and provide guidelines for their design.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Molecular Design for High&#8208;Performance Molecular Diodes Based on Pyridyl Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving the positions of nitrogen atoms in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of phenypyridyl&#8208;terminated isomers allows the coupling strength between the SAMs and the top electrode to be finely tuned from strong, to modest, to weak coupling. This results in the switching of the isomers from non&#8208;rectifying resistors (rectification ratios, r+=1 at &#177;1.5&#8197;V) to high&#8208;performance molecular diodes (r+=229).

         <title>Leveraging the Persistent Radical Effect in the Synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diaryl Dihydrobenzofurans

         <dc:description>
A simple, diastereoselective protocol for accessing trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaryl dihydrobenzofurans through efficient cross&#8208;coupling of persistent quinone radicals, derived from quinone methide dimers, and transient phenoxyl radicals is described.

Abstract
A simple method for accessing trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaryl dihydrobenzofurans is reported. This approach leverages the equilibrium between quinone methide dimers and their persistent radicals. This equilibrium is disrupted by phenols that yield comparatively transient phenoxyl radicals, leading to cross&#8208;coupling between the persistent and transient radicals. The resultant quinone methides with pendant phenols rapidly cyclize to form dihydrobenzofurans (DHBs). This putative biomimetic access to dihydrobenzofurans provides superb functional group tolerance and a unified approach for the synthesis of resveratrol&#8208;based natural products.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Response Nickel&#8208;Promoted Indium Oxide Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation from Intermittent Solar Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a distributed CO2 utilization system incorporating a fluctuating H2 supply. Ni loaded on In2O3 reduces the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2. The system exhibits a faster response (12&#8197;min) than bare oxide catalysts (42&#8197;min). Ni enhances the sensitivity of the catalyst to H2, enabling good performance at lower H2 concentrations and adaptability to a wide H2 fluctuation range compared to In2O3.







Abstract
Construction of a &#8220;net&#8208;zero&#8208;emission&#8221; system through CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with solar energy is an eco&#8208;friendly way to mitigate the greenhouse effect. Traditional CO2 hydrogenation demands centralized mass production for cost reduction with mass water electrolysis for hydrogen supply. To achieve continuous reaction with intermittent and fluctuating flow of H2 on a small&#8208;scale for distributed application scenarios, modulating the catalyst interface environment and chemical adsorption capacity to adapt fluctuating reaction conditions is highly desired. This paper describes a distributed clean CO2 utilization system in which the surface structure of catalysts is carefully regulated. The Ni catalyst with unsaturated electrons loaded on In2O3 can reduce the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2 supply, exhibiting a faster response (12&#8197;min) than bare oxide catalysts (42&#8197;min). Moreover, the introduction of Ni enhances the sensitivity of the catalyst to hydrogen, yielding a Ni/In2O3 catalyst with a good performance at lower H2 concentrations with a 15&#8197;times adaptability for wider hydrogen fluctuation range than In2O3, greatly reducing the negative impact of unstable H2 supplies derived from renewable energies.

         <dc:description>Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide or ethylene (C2H4) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;8) with znv&#160;topology and SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;9) with wly&#160;topology for efficient capture of C2H2&#160;from CO2&#160;and C2H4. Both ZNU&#8208;8 and ZNU&#8208;9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU&#8208;9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C2H2&#160;capacity (7.94 mmol/g) and a high C2H2/CO2&#160;(10.3) or C2H2/C2H4&#160;(11.6) selectivity. The calculated capacity of C2H2&#160;per anion (4.94 mol/mol at 1 bar) is the highest among all the anion pillared metal organic frameworks. Theoretical calculation indicated that the strong cooperative hydrogen bonds exist between acetylene and the pillared SiF62&#8208;&#160;anions in the confined cavity, which is further confirmed by in&#8208;situ IR spectra. The practical separation performance was explicitly demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments with equimolar C2H2/CO2&#160;mixtures and 1/99 C2H2/C2H4&#160;mixtures under various conditions with excellent recyclability and benchmark&#160;productivity of pure C2H2&#160;(5.13 mmol/g) or C2H4&#160;(48.57 mmol/g).</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;&#8208;Arabinofuranosylation by Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors could be used for &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This glycosylation method was applied successfully to the synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanosidic linkage has been in great demand for efficient synthesis of biologically active natural glycosides. In this study, we developed a regioselective and &#946;&#8208;stereospecific d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation promoted by a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions. The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors to give the corresponding &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosides (&#946;&#8208;Arbf) in high yields with complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity and high regioselectivity. The regioselectivity was completely reversed depending on the optical isomerism of the donor used and was predictable a priori using predictive models. Mechanistic studies based on DFT calculations revealed that the present glycosylation occurs through a highly dissociative concerted SNi mechanism. The usefulness of the glycosylation method was demonstrated by the chemical synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;(Quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)Benzaldehydes: Atroposelective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenative Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed transient Lewis pair interaction was found to be the key to facilitate the racemization of 8&#8208;arylquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;formaldehydes and enable an iridium&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution, accomplished via atroposelective allylation by transfer hydrogenative coupling.







Abstract
An atroposelective Ir&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes/1&#8208;naphthaldehydes by transfer hydrogenative coupling of allyl acetate is disclosed. The allylation reaction takes place with simultaneous installation of central and axial chirality, reaching high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantiomeric excesses when ortho&#8208;cyclometalated iridium&#8208;DM&#8208;BINAP is used as the catalyst. The racemization of the substrates occurs through a designed transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the quinoline nitrogen atom and the aldehyde carbonyl group.

         <title>Robust Proton Conduction against Mechanical Stress in Flexible Free&#8208;Standing Membrane Composed of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricated a highly oriented free&#8208;standing membrane composed of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP) with excellent mechanical properties under stress. This is the first study to demonstrate the robust proton conduction of 2D CPs under an applied bending stress. We found that proton conductivity remained almost constant during bending.







Abstract
Introduction of mechanical flexibility into proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymers (CPs) is in high demand for future protonic applications such as fuel cells and hydrogen sensors. Although such mechanical properties have been primarily investigated in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) CPs, in this study, we successfully fabricated highly flexible free&#8208;standing CP membranes with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which is beneficial for enhanced performance in the aforementioned applications. We fabricated a layered CP, Cu2(NiTCPP) (H4(H2TCPP); 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin), in which a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) square grid sheet composed of tetradentate nickel porphyrins and paddlewheel&#8208;type copper dimers was connected to each other by weak van der Waals forces. The mechanical flexibility was evaluated by bending and tensile tests. The flexural and Young's moduli of the membrane were significantly higher than those of conventional Nafion membranes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the in&#8208;plane proton conductivity of the membrane was maintained even under applied bending stress. Because the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the proton&#8208;conducting pathway through the hydrogen bonding network remains intact during the bending operation, our present study provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of new and advanced 2D CPs without using substrates or additional polymers for protonic devices.

         <title>Fused Indacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two fused indacene dimer isomers (s&#8208;ID and as&#8208;ID) have been synthesized and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. They both display an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. s&#8208;ID has localized antiaromaticity on the s&#8208;indacene units, while as&#8208;ID shows weak global aromaticity. Additionally, as&#8208;ID has a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap as compared to s&#8208;ID.







Abstract
Polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of two or more directly fused antiaromatic subunits are rare due to their high reactivity. However, it is important to understand how the interactions between the antiaromatic subunits influence the electronic properties of the fused structure. Herein, we present the synthesis of two fused indacene dimer isomers: s&#8208;indaceno[2,1&#8208;a]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (s&#8208;ID) and as&#8208;indaceno[3,2&#8208;b]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene (as&#8208;ID), containing two fused antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or as&#8208;indacene units, respectively. Their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. 1H&#8197;NMR/ESR measurements and DFT calculations revealed that both s&#8208;ID and as&#8208;ID have an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. However, while localized antiaromaticity was observed in s&#8208;ID, as&#8208;ID showed weak global aromaticity. Moreover, as&#8208;ID exhibited a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap than s&#8208;ID. All the differences can be attributed to their distinct quinoidal substructures.

         <title>Rotaxane Formation of Multicyclic Polydimethylsiloxane in a Silicone Network: A Step toward Constructing &#8220;Macro&#8208;Rotaxanes&#8221; from High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Axle and Wheel Components</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Macro&#8208;rotaxanes&#8221; which consist of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle and wheel components were constructed by in situ cross&#8208;linking of linear polymers in the presence of multicyclic polymers. Extending the concept of topological trapping to multicyclic showed that multicyclic polymers with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped, with up to 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% successfully topologically trapped as macro&#8208;rotaxanes.







Abstract
Rotaxanes consisting of a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle and wheel components (macro&#8208;rotaxanes) have high structural freedom, and are attractive for soft&#8208;material applications. However, their synthesis remains underexplored. Here, we investigated macro&#8208;rotaxane formation by the topological trapping of multicyclic polydimethylsiloxanes (mc&#8208;PDMSs) in silicone networks. mc&#8208;PDMS with different numbers of cyclic units and ring sizes was synthesized by cyclopolymerization of a &#945;,&#969;&#8208;norbornenyl&#8208;functionalized PDMS. Silicone networks were prepared in the presence of 10&#8211;60&#8197;wt&#8201;% mc&#8208;PDMS, and the trapping efficiency of mc&#8208;PDMS was determined. In contrast to monocyclic PDMS, mc&#8208;PDMSs with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped in the network as macro&#8208;rotaxanes. The damping performance of a 60&#8197;wt&#8201;% mc&#8208;PDMS&#8208;blended silicone network was evaluated, revealing a higher tan &#948; value than the bare PDMS network. Thus, macro&#8208;rotaxanes are promising as non&#8208;leaching additives for network polymers.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Internal Allylic Alkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a study of copper&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of internal allylic carbonates using functionalized alkyl and aryl Grignard reagents. The reactions exhibit good regioselectivity for either SN2 or SN2&#8242; products, enabling the preparation of products with E&#8208;alkene selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origins of the regioselectivity based on the different behaviors of homo&#8208; and heterocuprates.







Abstract
We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, regioselective, and stereospecific alkylation of unbiased internal allylic carbonates with functionalized alkyl and aryl Grignard reagents. The reactions exhibit high stereospecificity and regioselectivity for either SN2 or SN2&#8242; products under two sets of copper&#8208;catalyzed conditions, which enables the preparation of a broad range of products with E&#8208;alkene selectivity. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the regioselectivity based on the different behaviors of homo&#8208; and heterocuprates.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen Vacancies via Engineering Heterostructured Fe3C/Fe3O4 Catalysts for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective and feasible strategy to engineer oxygen vacancies in situ by constructing a heterojunction of Fe3C/Fe3O4 that enables an &#8220;optimized activation&#8208;desorption&#8221; system for the electrochemical conversion of N2 into NH3. Combined with experimental results and DFT calculations, the synergistic effect between oxygen vacancies and heterojunction was further elucidated.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions provides an intriguing pathway to convert N2 into NH3. However, significant kinetic barriers of the NRR at low temperatures in desirable aqueous electrolytes remain a grand challenge due to the inert N&#8801;N bond of the N2 molecule. Herein, we propose a unique strategy for in situ oxygen vacancy construction to address the significant trade&#8208;off between N2 adsorption and NH3 desorption by building a hollow shell structured Fe3C/Fe3O4 heterojunction coated with carbon frameworks (Fe3C/Fe3O4@C). In the heterostructure, the Fe3C triggers the oxygen vacancies of the Fe3O4 component, which are likely active sites for the NRR. The design could optimize the adsorption strength of the N2 and NxHy intermediates, thus boosting the catalytic activity for the NRR. This work highlights the significance of the interaction between defect and interface engineering for regulating electrocatalytic properties of heterostructured catalysts for the challenging NRR. It could motivate an in&#8208;depth exploration to advance N2 reduction to ammonia.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Brushes Grown by Surface&#8208;Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization from Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;based Non&#8208;Covalent Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;immobilized, initiator&#8208;modified cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest complexes allow the growth of supramolecular brushes with thicknesses of &gt;100&#8197;nm via atom transfer radical polymerization. The non&#8208;covalent immobilization of the initiator also provides a facile route towards patterned polymer brushes via drop casting of an aqueous solution of an initiator&#8208;modified adamantane derivative onto a CB[7] functionalized substrate.







Abstract
Polymer brushes are densely grafted, chain end&#8208;tethered assemblies of polymers that can be produced via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. Typically, this is accomplished using initiators or chain transfer agents that are covalently attached to the substrate. This manuscript reports an alternative route towards polymer brushes, which involves the use of non&#8208;covalent cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest interactions to surface&#8208;immobilize initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization. These non&#8208;covalent initiators can be used for the surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of a variety of water&#8208;soluble methacrylate monomers to generate supramolecular polymer brushes with film thicknesses of more than 100&#8197;nm. The non&#8208;covalent nature of the initiator also allows facile access to patterned polymer brushes, which can be produced in straightforward fashion by drop&#8208;casting a solution of the initiator&#8208;modified guest molecules onto a substrate that presents the cucurbit[7]uril host.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Cyclopropenes under Lanthanocene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral lanthanocene complex served as a unique catalyst for the asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines, efficiently affording a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives in high yields with good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity and without the need for a directing group.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines is of much interest and importance, but has remained hardly explored to date probably because of the lack of suitable catalysts. We report here the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with phosphines by a chiral lanthanocene catalyst bearing the C2&#8208;symmetric 5,6&#8208;dioxy&#8208;4,7&#8208;trans&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindenyl ligands. This protocol offers a selective and efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives, featuring 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and no need for a directing group.

&lt;p&gt;A chiral lanthanocene complex served as a unique catalyst for the asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines, efficiently affording a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives in high yields with good diastereo- and enantioselectivity and without the need for a directing group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines is of much interest and importance, but has remained hardly explored to date probably because of the lack of suitable catalysts. We report here the diastereo- and enantioselective hydrophosphination of 3,3-disubstituted cyclopropenes with phosphines by a chiral lanthanocene catalyst bearing the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric 5,6-dioxy-4,7-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-dialkyl-substituted tetrahydroindenyl ligands. This protocol offers a selective and efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives, featuring 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, good diastereo- and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and no need for a directing group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binuclear Copper(I) Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared emitting (NIR) compounds based on earth&#8208;abundant binuclear CuI complexes is presented. Two &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions are found in their solid&#8208;state structure yielding to doubly locked architectures that help to suppress excited state flattening distortions and quenching. The complexes have been successfully used in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), and unprecedented NIR electroluminescence (EL) with CuI compounds was achieved.







Abstract
Two binuclear heteroleptic CuI complexes, namely Cu&#8722;NIR1 and Cu&#8722;NIR2, bearing rigid chelating diphosphines and &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2,5&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole as the bis&#8208;bidentate ligand are presented. The proposed dinuclearization strategy yields a large bathochromic shift of the emission when compared to the mononuclear counterparts (M1&#8211;M2) and enables shifting luminescence into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region in both solution and solid state, showing emission maximum at ca. 750 and 712&#8197;nm, respectively. The radiative process is assigned to an excited state with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) character as demonstrated by in&#8208;depth photophysical and computational investigation. Noteworthy, X&#8208;ray analysis of the binuclear complexes unravels two interligand &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions yielding a doubly locked structure that disfavours flattening of the tetrahedral coordination around the CuI centre in the excited state and maintain enhanced NIR luminescence. No such interaction is present in M1&#8211;M2. These findings prompt the successful use of Cu&#8722;NIR1 and Cu&#8722;NIR2 in NIR light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), which display electroluminescence maximum up to 756&#8197;nm and peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.43&#8201;%. Their suitability for the fabrication of white&#8208;emitting LECs is also demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of NIR electroluminescent devices based on earth&#8208;abundant CuI emitters.

         <title>Mechanochemical Mediated Coexistence of B&#8592;N Coordination and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coexistence of hydrogen bonds and B&#8592;N coordination under mechanochemical conditions involving organoboron compounds is demonstrated. The mechanochemical conversion was monitored and reported by photoconversion of an alkene into a cyclobutane.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry afforded a photoactive cocrystal via coexisting (B)O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and B&#8592;N coordination. Specifically, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical ball mill grinding and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding of a boronic acid and an alkene resulted in mixtures of hydrogen&#8208;bonded and coordinated complexes akin to mixtures of noncovalent complexes that can be obtained in solution in equilibria processes. The alkenes of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assembly undergo an intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization in quantitative conversion, effectively reporting the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly processes. Our results suggest that interplay involving noncovalent bonds subjected to mechanochemical conditions can lead to functional solids where, in the current case, the structure composed of the weaker hydrogen bonding interactions predominates.

         <title>Towards a Precise NMR Quantification of Acute Phase Inflammation Proteins from Human Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of human serum show two characteristic signals originating from acute phase glycoprotein glycans, termed GlycA and B. We have unambiguously assigned them to Neu5Ac and GlcNAc moieties from N&#8208;glycans, respectively. They can be used for the simultaneous quantification of several acute phase inflammation proteins in 10&#8211;20&#8197;min. The method is illustrated with serum samples from COVID&#8208;19 patients.







Abstract
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of human serum and plasma show, besides metabolites and lipoproteins, two characteristic signals termed GlycA and B arising from the acetyl groups of glycoprotein glycans from acute phase proteins, which constitute good markers for inflammatory processes. Here, we report a comprehensive assignment of glycoprotein glycan NMR signals observed in human serum, showing that GlycA and GlycB signals originate from Neu5Ac and GlcNAc moieties from N&#8208;glycans, respectively. Diffusion&#8208;edited NMR experiments demonstrate that signal components can be associated with specific acute phase proteins. Conventionally determined concentrations of acute phase glycoproteins correlate well with distinct features in NMR spectra (R2 up to 0.9422, p&#8208;value &lt;0.001), allowing the simultaneous quantification of several acute phase inflammation proteins. Overall, a proteo&#8208;metabolomics NMR signature of significant diagnostic potential is obtained within 10&#8211;20&#8197;min acquisition time. This is exemplified in serum samples from COVID&#8208;19 and cardiogenic shock patients showing significant changes in several acute phase proteins compared to healthy controls.

         <title>Photo Responsive Electron and Proton Conductivity within a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) is constructed from zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as the acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8722;) as the donor. It exhibits photo&#8208;responsive electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer.







Abstract
Rational design of crystalline porous materials with coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer has not yet been reported to date. Herein, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) with zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8722;) as donor to form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layer. Three water molecules were situated in the channels to connect with acidic species through hydrogen bonding interactions to give a 3D framework. The continuous &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions along the a axis and the smooth H&#8208;bonding chain along the b axis provide the electron and proton transfer pathways, respectively. After 405&#8197;nm light irradiation, the photogenerated radicals could simultaneously endow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36 with photoswitchable electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer. By single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient absorption spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism of the switchable conductivity upon irradiation has been demonstrated.

         <title>Titanium Salalen Catalyzed Enantioselective Benzylic Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) Ti salalen complex (R=NO2) was shown to efficiently catalyze enantioselective benzylic hydroxylations with H2O2 as oxidant. Tetralin and indane derivatives are converted to benzylic alcohols with up to 98&#8201;% ee. The overoxidation to ketone is negligible. Epoxidation reactions are similarly effective, with 1&#8208;decene being converted to its epoxide in 90&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% ee, at 0.1&#8197;mol% catalyst loading.







Abstract
The titanium complex of the cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) derived Berkessel&#8208;salalen ligand is a highly efficient and enantioselective catalyst for the asymmetric epoxidation of terminal olefins with hydrogen peroxide (&#8220;Berkessel&#8208;Katsuki catalyst&#8221;). We herein report that this epoxidation catalyst also effects the highly enantioselective hydroxylation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with hydrogen peroxide. Mechanism&#8208;based ligand optimization identified a novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst of the highest efficiency ever reported for asymmetric catalytic benzylic hydroxylation, with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, while overoxidation to ketone is marginal. The novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst also shows enhanced epoxidation efficiency, as evidenced by e.g. the conversion of 1&#8208;decene to its epoxide in 90&#8201;% yield with 94&#8201;% ee, at a catalyst loading of 0.1&#8197;mol&#8208;% only.

         <title>Improved Birefringence Activated by Tetrahedra Decorated with a Single Linear Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve birefringence, namely decorating the tetrahedra with a single linear [S2] unit. Two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5 have been obtained. The introduction of the additional S atoms did not cause changes in the structure, but the optical anisotropy and birefringence were both enhanced greatly.







Abstract
Performance enhancement induced by structural modification has long been the target in materials science fields. Direct evidence to witness the effectivity of one strategy is challenging and necessary. In this work, a tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve the birefringent performance sharply, namely decorating the tetrahedra with a single linear [S2] unit. The strategy was verified by comprehensive characterization of two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5, which crystallize in the same space group, have similar unit cells and the same units arrangements. Theoretical characterization verified that the [GeS5] group has much larger polarization anisotropy than [GeS4], further demonstrated that the linear [S2] led to the sharp birefringence enlargement of K2BaGeS5 (0.19 vs 0.03 of K2BaGeS4). This work provides a new guiding thought to improve the birefringence performance.

         <title>Direct Regioselective Dehydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly regioselective, one&#8208;step dehydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic ketones in the presence of 2,3&#8208;dichlorobenzo&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone is described. The reaction proceeds via phosphoric acid&#8208;based enol catalysis and provides access to several &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.







Abstract
We disclose a highly regioselective, catalytic one&#8208;step dehydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic ketones in the presence of 2,3&#8208;dichlorobenzo&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ). The high regioselectivity originates from a phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enolization, selectively affording the thermodynamically preferred enol, followed by the subsequent oxidation event. Our method provides reliable access to several &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.

         <title>Group&#8208;Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (GTPISA) in Non&#8208;polar Media: An Organocatalyzed Route to Block Copolymer Nanoparticles at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles are designed by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly at room temperature in n&#8208;heptane. This novel polymerization method (GTPISA) opens new avenues to fabricate self&#8208;stabilized metal&#8208;free and sulphur&#8208;free nanoparticles in non&#8208;polar media for practical uses, e.g. as viscosity modifiers or as lubricants, while at the same time expanding the field of organic catalysis of polymerization.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&gt;50&#8201;&#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (GTPISA) in non&#8208;polar media (n&#8208;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis&#8208;benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non&#8208;polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non&#8208;soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self&#8208;assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non&#8208;polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non&#8208;polar environments.

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Polymerization of a Side&#8208;Chain Transformable Bulky Acrylamide Monomer and Subsequent Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification for Syntheses of Isotactic Polyacrylate and Polyacrylamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pendant&#8208;transformable bulky acrylamide monomer was designed for the synthesis of a series of isotactic poly(alkyl acrylamide)s and poly(methyl acrylate). The stereospecific radical polymerization of the special monomer was controlled under diluted condition at lower temperature. The pendant underwent subsequent quantitative aminolysis and alcoholysis post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
We report syntheses of isotactic polyacrylate and polyacrylamide via a stereospecific radical polymerization of a pendant&#8208;transformable monomer, acrylamide carrying isopropyl&#8208;substituted ureidosulfonamide (1), followed by post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM). The study in the alcoholysis and aminolysis reactions of the model compound (2) for evaluation of the transformation ability of the electron&#8208;withdrawing pendant group on the repeating unit 1 revealed the following points: the pendant of the polymer became more reactive than that of monomer; the pendant was active enough for aminolysis reaction affording the amide compound quantitatively without additive/catalyst; the addition of a lithium triflate [Li(OTf)] and triethylamine (Et3N) was effective as for promotion of the alcoholysis reaction. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) was quantitatively obtained via the radical polymerization of 1 in the presence of Li(OTf) at 60&#8201;&#176;C and the subsequent addition of methanol along with Et3N. Thus&#8208;obtained PMA showed higher isotacticity [m=74&#8201;%] than that directly obtained via radical polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) (m=51&#8201;%). The isotacticity was further increased as the temperature and monomer concentration were lower, and eventually m was increased up to 93&#8201;%. The aminolysis PPM after the iso&#8208;specific radical polymerization of 1 gave various isotactic polyacrylamides carrying different alkyl pendant groups, including poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).

The study in the alcoholysis and aminolysis reactions of the model compound (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) for evaluation of the transformation ability of the electron-withdrawing pendant group on the repeating unit &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; revealed the following points: the pendant of the polymer became more reactive than that of monomer; the pendant was active enough for aminolysis reaction affording the amide compound quantitatively without additive/catalyst; the addition of a lithium triflate [Li(OTf)] and triethylamine (Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) was effective as for promotion of the alcoholysis reaction. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) was quantitatively obtained via the radical polymerization of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of Li(OTf) at 60&#8201;&#176;C and the subsequent addition of methanol along with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N. Thus-obtained PMA showed higher isotacticity [&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;=74&#8201;%] than that directly obtained via radical polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;=51&#8201;%). The isotacticity was further increased as the temperature and monomer concentration were lower, and eventually &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; was increased up to 93&#8201;%. The aminolysis PPM after the iso-specific radical polymerization of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; gave various isotactic polyacrylamides carrying different alkyl pendant groups, including poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Hollow Nanoreactors for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Selective Catalytic Semihydrogenation Driven by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of hollow nanoreactors with a hollow multishelled structure and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles is reported. The hollow nanoreactors exhibit size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation because of differences in the energy barrier of substrate adsorption and steric hindrance.







Abstract
Mimicking the structures and functions of cells to create artificial organelles has spurred the development of efficient strategies for production of hollow nanoreactors with biomimetic catalytic functions. However, such structure are challenging to fabricate and are thus rarely reported. We report the design of hollow nanoreactors with hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles. Starting from a molecular&#8208;level design strategy, well&#8208;defined hollow multishelled structure phenolic resins (HoMS&#8208;PR) and carbon (HoMS&#8208;C) submicron particles were accurately constructed. HoMS&#8208;C serves as an excellent, versatile platform, owing to its tunable properties with tailored functional sites for achieving precise spatial location of metal nanoparticles, internally encapsulated (Pd@HoMS&#8208;C) or externally supported (Pd/HoMS&#8208;C). Impressively, the combination of the delicate nanoarchitecture and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles endow the pair of nanoreactors with size&#8211;shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation, including high activity and selectivity of Pd@HoMS&#8208;C for small aliphatic substrates and Pd/HoMS&#8208;C for large aromatic substrates. Theoretical calculations provide insight into the pair of nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in energy barrier of substrate adsorption. This work provides guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of hollow nanoreactors with precisely located active sites and a finely modulated microenvironment by mimicking the functions of cells.

         <title>Dynamic Zn/Electrolyte Interphase and Enhanced Cation Transfer of Sol Electrolyte for All&#8208;Climate Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin nanosheets of zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive of aqueous zinc metal batteries. The nanosheets not only bring a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. The enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase remarkably improve the electrochemical performance of Zn||LiMn2O4 in all climates.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of the promising anodes of aqueous batteries possesses notable advantages, but it faces severe challenges from severe side reactions and notorious dendrite growth. Here, ultrathin nanosheets of &#945;&#8208;zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive. The nanosheets not only create a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. Benefited from the enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase, the pouch cells of Zn||LiMn2O4 using this electrolyte remarkably improve electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, i.e. Zn powders as the Zn anode, high mass loading, and wide temperatures. The results expand the materials available for this dynamic interphase, provide an insightful understanding of the enhanced charge transfer in the electrolyte, and realize the combination of dynamic interphase and enhanced kinetics for all&#8208;climate performance.

         <title>Oxidation of 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin: Its Generality and Novelty as an Oxaporphyrin Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin from the 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic neutral state into 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication state was achieved by blocking the reactive pyrrolic &#946;&#8208;positions with aryl groups. The dication was further converted into dipyrrindione by a ring&#8208;opening reaction, as also observed in the oxidation of verdoheme into biliverdin in the heme catabolism, thus consolidating the participation of an oxaporphyrinium cation species.







Abstract
5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin (DOP) is a novel meso&#8208;oxaporphyrin analogue and exhibits unique 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromaticity, unlike its mother congener of 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin, commonly known as its cationic iron complex called verdohem, which is a key intermediate of heme catabolism. To reveal its reactivities and properties as an oxaporphyrin analogue, the oxidation of tetra&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylated DOP (DOP&#8208;Ar4) was explored in this study. Stepwise oxidation from the 20&#960;&#8208;electron neutral state was achieved, and the corresponding 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation and 18&#960;&#8208;electron dication were characterized. Further oxidation of the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication resulted in the formation of a ring&#8208;opened dipyrrindione product by hydrolysis. Considering a similar reaction of verdoheme to ring&#8208;opened biliverdin in the heme degradation in nature, the current result consolidates the ring&#8208;opening reactivity of oxaporphyrinium cation species.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Active Chiral Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts with Suppressed Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce aggregation&#8208;induced chirality in organic photovoltaic catalysts, which suppresses charge recombination by chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;polarization and improves photocatalytic activities by 60&#8211;70&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recombination of free charges in organic semiconductors reduces the available photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;carriers and restricts photovoltaic efficiency. In this work, the chiral organic semiconductors (Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S with enantiopure R&#8208; and S&#8208; chiral alkyl sidechains) are designed and synthesized, which show effective aggregation&#8208;induced chirality through mainchain packing with chiral conformations in non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups with tilt chirality. Based on the analysis of spin&#8208;injection, magnetic&#8208;hysteresis loop, and thermodynamics and dynamics of the excited state, we suggest that the aggregation&#8208;induced chirality can generate spin&#8208;polarization, which suppresses charge recombination and offers more available charge&#8208;carriers within Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S relative to the achiral counterpart (Y6). Then the chiral Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S show enhanced catalytic activity with optimal average hydrogen evolution rates of 205 and 217&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, 60&#8211;70&#8201;% higher than Y6, when they are employed as nanoparticle photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated solar light, AM1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Cleavage of Carbon Dioxide C=O Bond Promoted by Nickel&#8208;Boron Cooperativity in a PBP&#8208;Ni Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected reactivity promoted by the ability of the PBP ligand to cooperate with the metal center is observed after the insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8722;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe. The overall process involves a complex reaction with the participation of NiII/NiI/Ni0 species that ultimately results in the formation of a nickel cluster with butterfly structure.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of (tBuPBP)Ni(OAc) (5) by insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8722;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe (1) is presented. An unexpected CO2 cleavage process involving the formation of new B&#8722;O and Ni&#8722;CO bonds leads to the generation of a butterfly&#8208;structured tetra&#8208;nickel cluster (tBuPBOP)2Ni4(&#956;&#8208;CO)2 (6). Mechanistic investigation of this reaction indicates a reductive scission of CO2 by O&#8208;atom transfer to the boron atom via a cooperative nickel&#8208;boron mechanism. The CO2 activation reaction produces a three&#8208;coordinate (tBuP2BO)Ni&#8208;acyl intermediate (A) that leads to a (tBuP2BO)&#8722;NiI complex (B) via a likely radical pathway. The NiI species is trapped by treatment with the radical trap (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) to give (tBuP2BO)NiII(&#951;2&#8208;TEMPO) (7). Additionally, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis using 13C&#8208;enriched CO2 provides information about the species involved in the CO2 activation process.

     alt="Cleavage of Carbon Dioxide C=O Bond Promoted by Nickel-Boron Cooperativity in a PBP-Ni Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unexpected reactivity promoted by the ability of the PBP ligand to cooperate with the metal center is observed after the insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8722;C bond of (&lt;sup&gt;tBu&lt;/sup&gt;PBP)NiMe. The overall process involves a complex reaction with the participation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species that ultimately results in the formation of a nickel cluster with butterfly structure.

         <title>A Targeting Singlet Oxygen Battery for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Deep&#8208;Tissue Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is dependent on externally applied light and oxygen, and the depth of penetration of these factors can be insufficient for the treatment of deep infections. The short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also limit the antibacterial efficiency of PDT. Herein, we designed a targeted singlet oxygen delivery system, CARG&#8208;Py, for irradiation&#8208;free and oxygen&#8208;free PDT. This system was converted to the &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; CARG&#8208;1O2 and released singlet oxygen without external irradiation or oxygen. CARG&#8208;1O2 is composed of pyridones coupled to a targeting peptide that improves the utilization of singlet oxygen in deep multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. CARG&#8208;1O2 was shown to damage DNA, protein, and membranes by increasing the level of reactive oxygen inside bacteria; the attacking of multiple biomolecular sites caused the death of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An in vivo study in a MRSA&#8208;infected mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated the potential of CARG&#8208;1O2 for the efficient treatment of deep infections. This work provides a new strategy to improve traditional PDT for irradiation&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;free treatment of deep infections while improving convenience of PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Microporous Polymer for a Wittig Reaction Cycle in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wittig reaction is a key step in industrial processes to synthesise large quantities of vitamin A and various other important chemicals that are used in daily life. This article presents a pathway to achieve the Wittig reaction in a solid network. A highly porous triphenylphosphine&#8208;based polymer was applied as solid Wittig reagent which underwent, in a multi&#8208;step cycle, in total six post&#8208;synthetic modifications. This allowed to regenerate the solid Wittig reagent and reuse it for the same reaction cycle again. Of particular industrial relevance is that the newly developed material also enables a simple way of separating the product by filtration. Therefore, additional costly and difficult separation and purification steps are no longer needed.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Soluble Diketopyrrolopyrrole Chromophore Stacks from a Series of Pd(II)&#8208;based Ravels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to engineer the stacking of diketopyrropyrrole (DPP) dyes based on non&#8208;statistical metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assembly is introduced. Therefore, the DPP backbone is equipped with nitrogen&#8208;based donors that allow for different discrete assemblies to be formed upon addition of Pd(II), distinguished by the number of &#960;&#8208;stacked chromophores. A Pd3L6 three&#8208;ring, a heteroleptic Pd2L2L&#8217;2 ravel composed of two crossing DPPs (flanked by two carbazoles), and two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs (a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack), were obtained and systematically investigated. With increasing counts of stacked chromophores, UV&#8208;Vis absorptions red&#8208;shift and emission intensities decrease, except for compound Pd2L2L&#8217;2 which stands out with an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 52%. This is extraordinary for open&#8208;shell metal containing assemblies and explainable by an intra&#8208;assembly FRET process. The modular design and synthesis of soluble multi&#8208;chromophore building blocks opens potential for the preparation of nanodevices and materials with applications in sensing, photo&#8208;redox catalysis and optics.</dc:description>

         <title>Defluorinative&#160;Multi&#8208;Functionalization of Fluoroaryl Sulfoxides Enabled by Fluorine&#8208;Assisted Temporary Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its unique physical properties, fluorine is often used to open up new reaction channels. In this report, we establish a cooperation of [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement and fluorine&#8208;assisted temporary dearomatization for arene multi&#8208;functionalization. Specifically, the [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement of fluoroaryl sulfoxides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles generates an intriguing dearomatised sulfonium species which is short&#8208;lived but exhibits unusually high electrophilicity and thus can be instantly trapped by nucleophiles and dienes at a remarkably low temperature (&#8722;95 &#176;C) to produce four types of valuable multi&#8208;functionalized benzenes, respectively, involving appealing processes of defluorination, desulfurization, and sulfur shift. Mechanistic studies indicate that the use of fluorine on arenes not only circumvents the generally inevitable [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement but also impedes the undesired rearomatization process, thus provides a precious space for constructing and elaborating the temporarily dearomatised fluorinated sulfonium species.</dc:description>

         <title>From tethered to freestanding stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;protein interactions via fragment linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule stabilization of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy in chemical biology and drug discovery. However, the systematic discovery of PPI stabilizers remains a largely unmet challenge. Here we report a fragment&#8208;linking approach targeting the interface of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and an ER&#945;&#8208;derived peptide. Two classes of fragments &#8211; a covalent and a non&#8208;covalent &#8211; were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a non&#8208;covalent hybrid molecule where the original fragment interactions were largely conserved. Supported by twenty crystal structures, this initial hybrid molecule was further optimized, resulting in selective, 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; interaction. The high&#8208;resolution structures of both the single fragments, their co&#8208;crystal structures and those of the linked fragments document a feasible strategy to develop orthosteric PPI stabilizers by linking to an initial tethered fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Electrode Materials for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tremendous progress has been made in the field of electrochemical energy storage devices that rely on potassium&#8208;ions as charge carriers due to their abundant resources and excellent ion transport properties. Nevertheless, future practical developments not only count on advanced electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance, but also on competitive costs of electrodes for scalable production. In the past few decades, advanced carbon materials have attracted great interest due to their low cost, high selectivity, and structural suitability and have been widely investigated as functional materials for potassium&#8208;ion storage. This article provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly developing field, focusing on recent advanced and mechanistic understanding of carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, we also discuss recent achievements of dual&#8208;ion batteries and conversion&#8208;type K&#8208;X (X = O2, CO2, S, Se, I2) batteries towards potential practical applications as high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;power devices, and summarize carbon&#8208;based materials as the host for K&#8208;metal protection and possible directions for the development of potassium energy&#8208;related devices as well. Based on this, we bridge the gaps between various carbon&#8208;based functional materials structure and the related potassium&#8208;ion storage performance, especially provide guidance on carbon material design principles for next&#8208;generation potassium&#8208;ion storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Reversible Silicon Redox for High&#8208;Performing Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;based batteries such as Li/Cl2 batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl&#8208;based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well&#8208;documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl&#8208;based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl&#8208;based batteries. Here we show, for the first time, reversible Si redox in Cl&#8208;based batteries through efficient electrolyte dilution and anode/electrolyte interface passivation using 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane and cyclized polyacrylonitrile as key mediators. Our Si anode chemistry enables significantly increased cycling stability and shelf lives compared with conventional Li metal anodes. It also avoids the use of a large excess of anode materials, thus enabling the first rechargeable Cl2 full battery with remarkable energy and power densities of 809 Wh/kg&#160;and 4,277 W/kg, respectively. The Si anode chemistry affords fast kinetics with remarkable rate capability and low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, indicating its great potential in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Separation of DNA&#8208;encoded Artificial Cells Boosts Signal Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life&#8208;like hierarchical architecture shows great potential for advancing intelligent biosensing, but modular expansion of its sensitivity and functionality remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, we discovered that a DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell with a liquid core (LAC) can enhance peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Hemin and its DNA G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer complex (DGAH) without substrate&#8208;selectivity, unlike its gelled core (GAC) counterpart. The LAC is easily engineered as an ultrasensitive biosensing system, benefiting from DNA's high programmability and unique signal amplification capability mediated by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. As proof of concept, its versatility was successfully demonstrated by coupling with two molecular recognition elements to monitor tumor&#8208;related microRNA and profile cancer cell phenotypes. This scalable design philosophy offers new insights into the design of next generation of artificial cells&#8208;based biosensors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with deuterium or tritium gas as isotope sources and in&#8208;situ formed transition metal nanoparticles as hydrogen atom transfer pre&#8208;catalysts. By this means we have found synergistic reactivities applying two different HIE mechanisms, namely photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization HIE leading to the synthesis of highly deuterated complex molecules. Finally, we adopted these findings successfully to tritium chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Gallium Triggers Ferroptosis through a Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium ion (Ga3+) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non&#8208;apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (Ga&#8208;1); we found that Ga&#8208;1 acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, Ga&#8208;1 also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of Ga&#8208;1 and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic effect both in vitro and in vivo.&#160;This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti&#8208;neoplastic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO4 prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25 cm2), demonstrating the advantage of the MOD method in scalable preparation. Our work provides new insight and highlights the glorious future of MOD method for the design of scale&#8208;up efficient BiVO4 photoanode.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxy&#8208;rich Fe Single Atom Sites Boost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for the energy conversion and storage devices. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are&#160;the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88 V), Fe single atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89 V ) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate&#8208;limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics from Metallacages for Mimicking Light&#8208;Harvesting Antenna</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of covalent organic cages built from fluorophores capable of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized M2(LA)3(LB)2&#8208;type metallacages, simultaneously taking advantage of the synthetic accessibility and well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of metallacages, the good chemical stability of the covalent cages as well as the bright emission of AIE fluorophores. Moreover, the covalent cages could be further post&#8208;synthetically modified into an amide&#8208;functionalized cage with a higher quantum yield. Furthermore, these presented covalent cages proved to be good energy donors and were used to construct light&#8208;harvesting systems employing Nile Red as an energy acceptor. These light&#8208;harvesting systems displayed efficient energy transfer and high antenna effect, which enabled their use as efficient photocatalysts for a dehalogenation reaction. This research provides a new avenue for the development of luminescent covalent cages for light&#8208;harvesting and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Relaxing Wrinkles in Jammed Interfacial Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent bonding has emerged as a mean by which stresses in a network can be relaxed. Here, the strength of the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible liquids affect the same results in jammed assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants. Beyond a critical degree of overcrowding induced by the compression of jammed interfacial assemblies, the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles (NPs) can be broken, resulting in a desorption of the NPs from the interface. This reduces the areal density of nanoparticle surfactants at the interface, allowing the assemblies to relax, not to a fluid state but rather another jammed state. The relaxation of the wrinkles caused by the compression reflects the tendency of these assemblies to eliminate areas of high curvature, favoring a more planar geometry. This enabled the generation of giant vesicular and multivesicular structures from these assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinor[7]helicene and Beyond: Divergent Synthesis of Chiral Diradicaloids with Variable Open&#8208;Shell Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diradicaloid helicenes constructed formally by non&#8208;benzenoid double &#960;&#8208;extension of phenanthrene were synthesized by a common strategy involving double electrophilic benzannulation. Steric effects in the second benzannulation step led to considerable structural diversity among the products, yielding a symmetrical dinor[7]helicene 1 and two isomeric unsymmetrical double helicenes 2 and 3, containing a nor[5]helicene and [4]helicene fragment, respectively, in addition to a common nor[6]helicene motif. Geometries, configurational dynamics, and electronic structure of these helicenes were analyzed using solid&#8208;state structures, spectroscopic methods, and computational analyses. The open&#8208;shell character of the singlet states of these helicenes increases in the order 3 &lt; 1 &lt; 2, with strongly varying diradicaloid indexes and singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Compounds 1&#8211;3 displayed narrow optical gaps of 0.79&#8211;1.25 eV, resulting in significant absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region. They also exhibit reversible redox chemistry, each of them yielding stable radical cations, radical anions, and dianions, in some cases possessing intense NIR absorptions extending beyond 2500 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic and Cathodic Platinum Dissolution Processes Involve Different Oxide Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt dissolves transiently during formation and reduction of ultrathin Pt surface oxides, leading to deterioration of Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction electrocatalysts in fuel cells. We observe the formation of two specific Pt surface oxides on Pt(100) and determine their atomic&#8208;scale structure. Pt dissolution during oxidation can be linked to growth of the inner stripe&#8208;like oxide; dissolution during oxide reduction involves the outer amorphous oxide.







Abstract
The degradation of Pt&#8208;containing oxygen reduction catalysts for fuel cell applications is strongly linked to the electrochemical surface oxidation and reduction of Pt. Here, we study the surface restructuring and Pt dissolution mechanisms during oxidation/reduction for the case of Pt(100) in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4 by combining operando high&#8208;energy surface X&#8208;ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry, and density functional theory. Our atomic&#8208;scale structural studies reveal that anodic dissolution, detected during oxidation, and cathodic dissolution, observed during the subsequent reduction, are linked to two different oxide phases. Anodic dissolution occurs predominantly during nucleation and growth of the first, stripe&#8208;like oxide. Cathodic dissolution is linked to a second, amorphous Pt oxide phase that resembles bulk PtO2 and starts to grow when the coverage of the stripe&#8208;like oxide saturates. In addition, we find the amount of surface restructuring after an oxidation/reduction cycle to be potential&#8208;independent after the stripe&#8208;like oxide has reached its saturation coverage.

         <title>Discovery of Two&#8208;dimensional Hexagonal MBene HfBO and Exploration on its Potential for Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical applications of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal borides (MBenes) have been severely hindered by the lack of accessible MBenes because of the difficulties in the selective etching of traditional ternary MAB phases with orthorhombic symmetry (ort&#8208;MAB). Here, we discover a family of ternary hexagonal MAB (h&#8208;MAB) phases and 2D hexagonal MBenes (h&#8208;MBenes) by ab initio predictions and experiments. Calculations suggest that the ternary h&#8208;MAB phases are more suitable precursors for MBenes than the ort&#8208;MAB phases. Based on the prediction, we report the experimental synthesis of h&#8208;MBene HfBO by selective removal of In from h&#8208;MAB Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO delivered a specific capacity of 420 mAh g&#8208;1 as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, demonstrating the potential for energy&#8208;storage applications. The discovery of this h&#8208;MBene HfBO added a new member to the growing family of 2D materials and provided opportunities for a wide range of novel applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B. multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X. innexi. In turn, the X. innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B. multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B. multivorans and X. innexi through MV exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>General Design Concepts for CAPodes as Ionologic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving are designed providing a generalized concept, resulting in a novel CAPode system with a high rectification ratio (RRII, 96.29&#8201;%) and an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;,&#8216;AND&#8217;). This work provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.







Abstract
Capacitive analogues of semiconductor diodes (CAPodes) present a new avenue for energy&#8208;efficient and nature&#8208;inspired next&#8208;generation computing devices. Here, we disclose the generalized concept for bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving. Controllable&#8208;unidirectional ion flux is realized by blocking electrolyte ions from entering sub&#8208;nanometer pores. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage characteristics with a high rectification ratio (96.29&#8201;%). The enhancement of capacitance is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of an omnisorbing carbon as counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;, &#8216;AND&#8217;). This work demonstrates CAPodes as a generalized concept to achieve p&#8208;n and n&#8208;p analogue junctions based on selective ion electrosorption, provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.

         <title>Enantioselective C3&#8208;Allylation of Pyridines via Tandem Borane and Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step method for highly enantioselective C3&#8208;allylation reactions of pyridines was developed. The method involved borane&#8208;catalyzed dearomative pyridine hydroboration, palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dearomatized intermediate, and finally oxidation by air. The method was applicable to a broad range of pyridines, N&#8208;heteroarenes, and allylic esters.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot method for enantioselective C&#8722;H allylation of pyridines at C3 via tandem borane and palladium catalysis. This method involves borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration to generate dihydropyridines, then palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dihydropyridines with allylic esters, and finally air oxidation of the allylated dihydropyridines to afford the products. This method enables the introduction of an allylic group at C3 with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>In situ Engineering of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages via a Nanodrug&#8208;Delivering&#8208;Drug (&#946;&#8208;Elemene@Stanene) Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The STNSP@ELE strategy, employing 2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), can repolarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in situ, overcome immunosuppression and enhance chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This study not only demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of the STNSP&#8208;based nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy for immunosuppressive tumors but also establishes general platforms for 2D nanomaterial&#8208;mediated cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment (TME), yet in situ engineering of TAMs for enhanced tumor immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in translational immuno&#8208;oncology. Here, we report an innovative nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug (STNSP@ELE) strategy that leverages two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), a small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, to overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and improve chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that both STNSP and ELE are capable of polarizing the tumor&#8208;supportive M2&#8208;like TAMs into a tumor&#8208;suppressive M1&#8208;like phenotype, which acts with the ELE chemotherapeutic to boost antitumor responses. In vivo mouse studies demonstrate that STNSP@ELE treatment can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME by significantly increasing the intratumoral ratio of M1/M2&#8208;like TAMs, enhancing the population of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells, and elevating the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines in B16F10 melanomas, thereby promoting a robust antitumor response. Our study not only demonstrates that the STNSP@ELE chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanoplatform has immune&#8208;modulatory capabilities that can overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors, but also highlights the promise of this nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy in developing other nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics and treating various types of immunosuppressive tumors.

         <title>Polymerizable Solvent&#8208;free Organic Liquids: A New Approach for Large Area Flexible and Foldable Luminescent Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polymerizable solvent&#8208;free organic liquid approach has been introduced to overcome the inherent limitations of organic liquid emitters. On&#8208;surface thermochemical polymerization of the hybrid liquids results in flexible&amp;foldable large&#8208;area luminescent films. Our strategy is well suited for developing tunable and white light&#8208;emitting free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area flexible and transparent films suitable for futuristic applications.







Abstract
The high demand for light&#8208;emitting and display devices made luminescent organic materials as attractive candidates. Solvent&#8208;free organic liquids are one of the promising emitters among them due to the salient features. However, the inherent limitations of forming sticky and noncurable surfaces must be addressed to become an alternate emitter for large&#8208;area device applications. Herein, we functionalized solvent&#8208;free organic liquids having monomeric emission in bulk with polymerizable groups to improve the processability. The polymerizable group on carbazole, naphthalene monoimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free liquid emitters enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization. These emitters alone and in combinations can be directly coated on a glass substrate without the help of solvents. Subsequent photo or thermal polymerization leads to stable, non&#8208;sticky, flexible, foldable, and free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area films with reasonably high quantum yield. Our demonstration of the tunable and white light&#8208;emitting films using polymerizable solvent&#8208;free liquids might be a potential candidate in flexible/foldable/stretchable electronics. The new concept of polymerizable liquid can be extended to other functional features suitable for futuristic applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Thin Films as Ideal Matrices for Azide Photolysis in Vacuum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the photo&#8208;mediated reactions of azides in well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;(Da&#8208;SBDC) SURMOF matrices using a solvent&#8208;free approach the initial formation of the nitrene intermediate is shown to be followed by an intramolecular amination yielding an indoloindole. This work offers a novel strategy for precisely controlled chemical transformations of matrix&#8208;isolated azides in crystalline surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs).







Abstract
Studies on reactions in solutions are often hampered by solvent effects. In addition, detailed investigation on kinetics is limited to the small temperature regime where the solvent is liquid. Here, we report the in situ spectroscopic observation of UV&#8208;induced photochemical reactions of aryl azides within a crystalline matrix in vacuum. The matrices are formed by attaching the reactive moieties to ditopic linkers, which are then assembled to yield metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs). These porous, crystalline frameworks are then used as model systems to study azide&#8208;related chemical processes under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, where solvent effects can be safely excluded and in a large temperature regime. Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) allowed us to monitor the photoreaction of azide in SURMOFs precisely. The in situ IRRAS data, in conjunction with XRD, MS, and XPS, reveal that illumination with UV light first leads to forming a nitrene intermediate. In the second step, an intramolecular rearrangement occurs, yielding an indoloindole derivative. These findings unveil a novel pathway for precisely studying azide&#8208;related chemical transformations. Reference experiments carried out for solvent&#8208;loaded SURMOFs reveal a huge diversity of other reaction schemes, thus highlighting the need for model systems studied under UHV conditions.

         <title>Adamantoid Scaffolds for Multiple Cargo Loading and Cellular Delivery as &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trioxaadamantanes derived from inositol orthoesters, containing three conjugatable sites, form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). Three drug molecules could be attached per adamantoid scaffold through enzyme&#8208;labile linkages and a successful drug delivery to HeLa cells as their &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion complexes was demonstrated.







Abstract
There is huge demand for developing guests that bind &#946;&#8208;CD and can conjugate multiple cargos for cellular delivery. We synthesized trioxaadamantane derivatives, which can conjugate up to three cargos per guest. 1H NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed these guests form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;CD with association constants in the order of 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Co&#8208;crystallization of &#946;&#8208;CD with guests yielded crystals of their 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes as determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In all cases, trioxaadamantane core is buried within the hydrophobic cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD and three hydroxyl groups are exposed outside. We established biocompatibility using representative candidate G4 and its inclusion complex with &#946;&#8208;CD (&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G4), by MTT assay using HeLa cells. We incubated HeLa cells with rhodamine&#8208;conjugated G4 and established cellular cargo delivery using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. For functional assay, we incubated HeLa cells with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;inclusion complexes of G4&#8208;derived prodrugs G6 and G7, containing one and three units of the antitumor drug (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;camptothecin, respectively. Cells incubated with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 displayed the highest internalization and uniform distribution of camptothecin. &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 showed higher cytotoxicity than G7, camptothecin, G6 and &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G6, affirming the efficiency of adamantoid derivatives in high&#8208;density loading and cargo delivery.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of an Anionic Diazoolefin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic diazoolefin was synthesized. It was found to display a distinct reactivity as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. Furthermore, it can act as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand for metal complexes.







Abstract
Bent (hetero)allenes such as carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes can act as neutral C&#8208;donor ligands, and diverse applications in coordination chemistry have been reported. N&#8208;Heterocyclic diazoolefins are heterocumulenes, which can function in a similar fashion as L&#8208;type ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the reactivity of an anionic diazoolefin. This compound displays distinct reactivity compared to neutral diazoolefins, as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. The anionic diazoolefin can be employed as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand in salt metathesis reactions with metal halide complexes. Extrusion of dinitrogen was observed in a reaction with PCl(NiPr2)2, resulting in a stable phosphinocarbene.

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for recording residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) by NMR spectroscopy is reported by Lo&#239;c Salmon, Christoph Giese and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202305120). The medium relies on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli, is compatible with harsh experimental conditions and allows RDC measurements for proteins, nucleic acids and small organic molecules.

         <title>Integrated Soft Porosity and Electrical Properties of Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;Insulating Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructured nanocrystals are reported by Ken&#8208;ichi Otake, Susumu Kitagawa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303903). These nanocrystals combine soft porosity and electrical properties into a single material. They exhibit semiconductive soft porous interfaces that connect a flexible core and a chemiresistive shell. The cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF nanocrystals demonstrate enhanced selective sorption towards CO2, as well as readable softness, electrical gating, and &#8220;shape memory&#8221; effects for the guest&#8208;responsive iMOF core.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoparticles with Universal Dispersibility through Crown Ether Surface Coordination for Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis and Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids in stable colloids is critical for their availability and processibility. In their Communication (e202303280), Hang Xing et&#8197;al. report a crown ether surface coordination approach that enables the universal suspension of various MOF powders into immiscible polar and nonpolar solvents, exhibiting exceptional dispersibility without compromising the accessible voids. The crown ether&#8208;coated MOFs exhibit potential as effective phase&#8208;transfer catalysts and enable the fabrication of uniform membranes with improved performances.

         <title>Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#160;(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. This effect is induced by the first water layer that is in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2&#160;(100) surface. This ordered water layer creates a key&#8208;lock H&#8208;bond pattern with the underlying surface hydroxyl groups, hindering the interactions with liquid water. The hydrophobicity is manifested by a measurable water contact angle and a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water, as reported by Lorenzo Agosta, Kersti Hermansson et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202303910).

     alt="Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. This effect is induced by the first water layer that is in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;(100) surface. This ordered water layer creates a key-lock H-bond pattern with the underlying surface hydroxyl groups, hindering the interactions with liquid water. The hydrophobicity is manifested by a measurable water contact angle and a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water, as reported by Lorenzo Agosta, Kersti Hermansson et&#8197;al. in their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202303910"&gt;e202303910&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Twisted Diindeno&#8208;Fused Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene Derivatives and their Dianions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituents of different sizes have been used to synthesize diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity. The twisting of the neutral antiaromatic compounds led to them being endowed with chirality, as well as enhanced energy gaps with decreased diradical character. Furthermore, the doubly reduced species exhibited global aromaticity and decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity.







Abstract
We report a facile synthesis of diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives (DIDBA&#8208;2Cl, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph, and DIDBA&#8208;2H) with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity using three substituents (chloro, phenyl, and hydrogen) of various sizes. The planarization of their cores, as evidenced by the decreased end&#8208;to&#8208;end torsional angles, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their enhanced energy gaps with twisting were investigated by a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods with density functional theory, which showed a transition from singlet open&#8208;shell to closed&#8208;shell configuration. Moreover, their doubly reduced states, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph2&#8722; and DIDBA&#8208;2H2&#8722;, were achieved by chemical reduction. The structures of dianions were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which elucidated that the electron charging further distorted the backbones. The electronic structure of the dianions was demonstrated by experimental and theoretical approaches, suggesting decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity, different from the neutral species.

         <title>Hierarchical LTL Zeolite as an Efficient and Sustainable Solid Acid Catalyst for Replacing HCl in the Production of Polyurethane Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits remarkable catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in the conversion of aminal to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA), an important precursor for polyurethane production. External Br&#248;nsted acid sites convert aminal to aminobenzylaniline, whereas 1D cage&#8208;like micropores induces self&#8208;assembly of two linear para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline molecules and their bimolecular conversion into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDAs.







Abstract
In many industrially important reactions, caustic mineral acid catalysts have been successfully replaced with green solid acids such as zeolites. In this context, extensive efforts have been devoted to replacing HCl to produce methylenedianiline (MDA), a key intermediate in polyurethane production. Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved thus far due to low activity, selectivity towards the desired 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA, and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here we report that meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits unprecedentedly high activity, selectivity, and stability. The one&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like micropores of LTL promote the bimolecular reaction between two para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline intermediates to selectively produce 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA and inhibit the formation of undesired isomers and heavy oligomers. Meanwhile, the secondary mesopores alleviate mass transfer limitations, resulting in a 7.8&#8208;fold higher MDA formation rate compared to solely microporous LTL zeolite. Due to suppressed oligomer formation and fast mass transfer, the catalyst exhibits inappreciable deactivation in an industrially relevant continuous flow reactor.

         <title>Dynamic Cages &#8208; Towards Nanostructured Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in capsular assemblies such as dynamic organic and coordination cages has blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural variability, these systems have found applications in diverse fields of research, including energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation, molecular recognition, and live&#8208;cell imaging. In the exploration of the potential of these discrete architectures, they are increasingly being employed in the formation of more complex systems and smart materials. This Review highlights the most promising pathways to overcome common drawbacks of cage systems (stability, recovery) and discusses the most promising strategies for their hybridization with systems featuring various dimensionalities. Following the description of the most recent advances in the fabrication of zero to three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;based systems, this Review will provide the reader with the structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the employed cages and the properties of the materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Inorganic Click Reaction for the Synthesis of Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the use of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of a new class of inorganic rotaxanes containing gold(I) triazaphosphole stoppers. Electron&#8208;deficient bis&#8208;azides, which thread perethylated pillar[5]arene in aromatic solvents, readily react with two equivalents of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to afford interlocked molecules via an inorganic click reaction. These transformations proceed in good yields (ca. 65%) and in the absence of a catalyst. The resulting organometallic rotaxanes are air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable and can be purified by column chromatography under aerobic conditions. The targeted rotaxanes were characterized by multi&#8208;element nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass&#8208;spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>MET&#8208;Activating Ubiquitin Multimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U&#8208;bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET, derived from MET&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U&#8208;body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso&#8208;grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U&#8208;body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U&#8208;body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF&#8208;induced MET&#8208;phosphorylation. Using the U&#8208;body constructs, their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U&#8208;bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation&#8208;promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso&#8208;grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein&#8208;based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

Such U-body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U-body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF-induced MET-phosphorylation. Using the U-body constructs, their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U-bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation-promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso-grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein-based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Units as Photocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a promising platform for photocatalysts. Their crystalline porous nature allows comprehensive mechanistic studies of photocatalysis, which have revealed that their general photophysical parameters, such as light absorption ability, electronic band structure, and charge separation efficiency, can be conveniently tailored by structural modifications. However, further understanding of the relationship between structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity is required from the viewpoint of charge&#8208;carrier transport, because the charge&#8208;carrier property is closely related to alleviation of the excitonic effect. In the present study, COFs composed of a fixed cobalt (Co) porphyrin (Por) centered tetraamine as an acceptor unit with differently conjugated dicarbaldehyde based donor units, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), thienothiophene (TT), or phenyl (TA), were synthesized to form CoPor&#8208;BDT, Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT, or Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide was in the order of Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT &gt; Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT &gt; Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA. The results indicated that the excitonic effect, associated with their charge&#8208;carrier densities and &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, was a significant factor in photocatalysis performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reforming the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase by nanoscale structure regulation for stable lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries depends on the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes. Rationally improving SEI uniformity is hindered by poorly understanding the effect of structure and components of SEI on its uniformity. Herein, a bilayer structure of SEI formed by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes was demonstrated to improve SEI uniformity. In the bilayer SEI, LiNxOy generated by ISDN occupies top layer and LiF dominates bottom layer next to anode. The uniformity of lithium deposition is remarkably improved with the bilayer SEI, mitigating the consumption rate of active Li and electrolytes. The cycle life of lithium metal batteries with bilayer SEI is three times as that with common anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions. A prototype lithium metal pouch cell of 430 Wh kg&#8722;1 undergoes 173 cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of a reasonable structure of SEI on reforming SEI uniformity.</dc:description>

         <title>Eliminating Concentration Polarization with Cationic Covalent Organic Polymer to Promote Effective Overpotential of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge. The whole network exhibits strong positive charge and effectively repels the positively charged ammonium, enabling an ultra&#8208;low interfacial product concentration, and successfully driving the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a continuous high&#8208;level reaction rate. As expected, when this tailored microenvironment is coupled with a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst, a 24&#8208;fold improvement is generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74 %) as compared with the bare one. The proposed strategy underscores the importance of optimizing dynamic processes as a means of improving overall performance in electrochemical syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Tryptophan in Multicomponent Petasis Reactions for Peptide Stapling and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;component peptide stapling is an appealing method for preparing enzymatically stable peptides with incorporated biologically relevant tags. An unprecedented approach, utilising the tryptophan&#8208;mediated multicomponent Petasis reaction (TMPR), facilitates the generation of stapled peptides and enables their late&#8208;stage functionalisation. A variety of examples are presented to highlight the advantages of the method.







Abstract
Peptide stapling is a robust strategy for generating enzymatically stable, macrocyclic peptides. The incorporation of biologically relevant tags (such as cell&#8208;penetrating motifs or fluorescent dyes) into peptides, while preserving their binding interactions and enhancing their stability, is highly sought after. Despite the unique opportunities offered by tryptophan&#8216;s indole scaffold for targeted functionalisation, its utilisation in peptide stapling has been limited as compared to other amino acids. Herein, we present an approach for peptide stapling using the tryptophan&#8208;mediated Petasis reaction. This method enables the synthesis of both stapled and labelled peptides and is applicable to both solution and solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Importantly, the use of the Petasis reaction in combination with tryptophan facilitates the formation of stapled peptides in a straightforward, multicomponent fashion, while circumventing the formation of undesired by&#8208;products. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient and diverse late&#8208;stage peptide modifications, thereby enabling rapid production of numerous conjugates for biological and medicinal applications.

         <title>Reprocessible Triketoenamine&#8208;Based Vitrimers with Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triketoenamine&#8208;based dynamic covalent network was developed that is dual&#8208;recyclable: by mechanical reprocessing and chemically recycled in a closed loop. The work sheds light on the future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.







Abstract
Development of thermosets that can be repeatedly recycled via both chemical route (closed&#8208;loop) and thermo&#8208;mechanical process is attractive and remains an imperative task. In this work, we reported a triketoenamine based dynamic covalent network derived from 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and secondary amines. The resulting triketoenamine based network does not have intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thus reducing its &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, lowering the stability of the tautomer structure, and enabling its dynamic feature. By virtue of the highly reversible bond exchange, this novel dynamic covalent bond enables the easy construction of highly crosslinked and chemically reprocessable networks from commercially available monomers. The as&#8208;made polymer monoliths exhibit high mechanical properties (tensile strength of 79.4&#8197;MPa and Young's modulus of 571.4&#8197;MPa) and can undergo a monomer&#8208;network&#8208;monomer (yields up to 90&#8201;%) recycling mediated by an aqueous solution, with the new&#8208;generation polymer capable of restoring the material strength to its original state. In addition, owing to its dynamic nature, a catalyst&#8208;free and low&#8208;temperature reprogrammable covalent adaptable network (vitrimer) was achieved. The design concept reported herein can be applied to the development of other novel vitrimers with high repressibility and recyclability, and sheds light on future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>p&#8208;Block Bismuth Nanoclusters Sites Activated by Atomically Dispersed Bismuth for Tandem Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based electrocatalysts composed of bismuth nanoclusters and atomically dispersed bismuth is prepared for highly selective electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction into hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms, demonstrating synergistic catalysis between single&#8208;atomic sites and nanoclusters.







Abstract
Constructing electrocatalysts with p&#8208;block elements is generally considered rather challenging owing to their closed d shells. Here for the first time, we present a p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based (Bi&#8208;based) catalyst with the co&#8208;existence of single&#8208;atomic Bi sites coordinated with oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) atoms and Bi nanoclusters (Biclu) (collectively denoted as BiOSSA/Biclu) for the highly selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As a result, BiOSSA/Biclu gives a high H2O2 selectivity of 95&#8201;% in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode, and a large current density of 36&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.15&#8197;V vs. RHE, a considerable H2O2 yield of 11.5&#8197;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with high H2O2 Faraday efficiency of &#8764;90&#8201;% at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE and a long&#8208;term durability of &#8764;22&#8197;h in H&#8208;cell test. Interestingly, the experimental data on site poisoning and theoretical calculations both revealed that, for BiOSSA/Biclu, the catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms. This work demonstrates a new synergistic tandem strategy for advanced p&#8208;block&#8208;element Bi catalysts featuring atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites, and the great potential of rational material design for constructing highly active electrocatalysts based on p&#8208;block metals.

         <title>Molecular Bridge on Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bridge link strategy for buried surface with perovskite provides superior defect passivation and energy alignment by employing the rationally selected mediator of glycocyamine. The interface enables slower crystal growth with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes. The modified planar perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.70&#8201;% with an open circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V and retains 89&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 800&#8197;h.







Abstract
The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly important for charge transfer and device stability, while the buried interface with the impact on perovskite film growth has been paid less attention. Herein, we use a molecular modifier, glycocyamine (GDA) to build a molecular bridge on the buried interface of SnO2/perovskite, resulting in superior interfacial contact. This is achieved through the strongly interaction between GDA and SnO2, which also appreciably modulates the energy level. Moreover, GDA can regulate the perovskite crystal growth, yielding perovskite film with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes, exhibiting substantially reduced defect density. Consequently, PSCs with GDA modification demonstrate significant improvement of open circuit voltage (close to 1.2&#8197;V) and fill factor, leading to an improved power conversion efficiency from 22.60&#8201;% to 24.70&#8201;%. Additionally, stabilities of GDA devices under maximum power point and 85&#8201;&#176;C heat both perform better than the control devices.

         <title>meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized pyridines have broad applications in chemical science. However, direct functionalization of pyridine C&#8722;H bonds at the meta&#8208;position is difficult. Significant advances have been achieved in recent years through directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation or temporary dearomatization strategies. Herein, we describe the advances and challenges in the development of meta&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines.







Abstract
The pyridine moiety is an important core structure for a variety of drugs, agrochemicals, catalysts, and functional materials. Direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in pyridines is a straightforward approach to access valuable substituted pyridines. Compared to the direct ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization, meta&#8208;selective pyridine C&#8722;H functionalization is far more challenging due to the inherent electronic properties of the pyridine entity. This review summarizes currently available methods for pyridine meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization using a directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation, and temporary dearomatization strategies. Recent advances in ligand control and temporary dearomatization are highlighted. We analyze the advantages as well as limitations of current techniques and hope to inspire further developments in this important area.

A facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy has been adopted to access highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs) with the in&#8208;situ installation of four cyano substitutents at room temperature. The TCDADIs feature a coplanar backbone, high electron affinity, and high crystallinity, which are a benefit for the electron&#8208;transport performance, with impressive electron mobilities of above 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 obtained.







Abstract
A family of novel highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyano&#8208;substituted acene diimides, named as tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs), have been synthesized using a facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy. Unlike conventional cyano substitution reactions, our approach enables access to a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone with the in&#8208;situ formation of four cyano substitutents at room temperature while avoiding extra cyano&#8208;functionalization reactions. TCDADIs decorated with different N&#8208;alkyl substituents present good solubility, near&#8208;coplanar backbones, good crystallinity, and low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of &#8722;4.33&#8197;eV, all of which contribute to desirable electron&#8208;transport performance when applied in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET). The highest electron mobility of an OFET based on a 2&#8208;hexyldecyl&#8208;substituted TCDADI single crystal reaches 12.6&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is not only among the highest values for the reported n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials (OSMs) but also exceeds that of most n&#8208;type OSMs decorated with imide units.

         <title>Li Plating Regulation on Fast&#8208;Charging Graphite Anodes by a Triglyme&#8208;LiNO3 Synergistic Electrolyte Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a strategy of Li plating regulation rather than Li plating inhibition. Under this situation, Li plating on graphite has a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and a high reversibility. By effectively utilizing Li plating instead of suppressing it, it is possible to achieve a compatible pathway for fast charging of graphite anodes.







Abstract
Graphite anodes are prone to dangerous Li plating during fast charging, but the difficulty to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step has made a challenging to eliminate Li plating thoroughly. Thus, the inherent thinking on inhibiting Li plating needs to be compromised. Herein, an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform Li&#8208;ion flux is constructed on graphite anode by introducing a triglyme (G3)&#8208;LiNO3 synergistic additive (GLN) to commercial carbonate electrolyte, for realizing a dendrite&#8208;free and highly&#8208;reversible Li plating under high rates. The cross&#8208;linked oligomeric ether and Li3N particles derived from the GLN greatly improve the stability of the SEI before and after Li plating and facilitate the uniform Li deposition. When 51&#8201;% of lithiation capacity is contributed from Li plating, the graphite anode in the electrolyte with 5 vol.% GLN achieved an average 99.6&#8201;% Li plating reversibility over 100&#8197;cycles. In addition, the 1.2&#8208;Ah LiFePO4 | graphite pouch cell with GLN&#8208;added electrolyte stably operated over 150&#8197;cycles at 3&#8197;C, firmly demonstrating the promise of GLN in commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries for fast&#8208;charging applications.

Herein, an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform Li-ion flux is constructed on graphite anode by introducing a triglyme (G3)-LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synergistic additive (GLN) to commercial carbonate electrolyte, for realizing a dendrite-free and highly-reversible Li plating under high rates. The cross-linked oligomeric ether and Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N particles derived from the GLN greatly improve the stability of the SEI before and after Li plating and facilitate the uniform Li deposition. When 51&#8201;% of lithiation capacity is contributed from Li plating, the graphite anode in the electrolyte with 5 vol.% GLN achieved an average 99.6&#8201;% Li plating reversibility over 100&#8197;cycles. In addition, the 1.2-Ah LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; | graphite pouch cell with GLN-added electrolyte stably operated over 150&#8197;cycles at 3&#8197;C, firmly demonstrating the promise of GLN in commercial Li-ion batteries for fast-charging applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;inflammatory Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for Colitis Treatment: Construction and In Vivo Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of bilirubin&#8208;attached glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles was constructed as a platform enabling identification of an anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicine. Direct in vivo screening of the nanoparticle library by oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicine capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms.







Abstract
Common medications for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have limited therapeutic efficacy and severe adverse effects. This underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively target inflamed sites in the gastrointestinal tract upon oral administration, exerting potent therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic effects. Here, we report the construction and in vivo therapeutic evaluation of a library of anti&#8208;inflammatory glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (designated GlyNPs) in a mouse model of IBD. The anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNP library was created by attaching bilirubin (BR) to a library of glycopolymers composed of random combinations of the five most naturally abundant sugars. Direct in vivo screening of 31&#8197;BR&#8208;attached anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNPs via oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate GlyNP capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms. These findings suggest that the BR&#8208;attached GlyNP library can be used as a platform to identify anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicines for various inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Catalytic &#963;&#8208;Bond Annulation with Ambiphilic Organohalides Enabled by &#946;&#8208;X Elimination
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a &#963;&#8208;bond annulation strategy that combines strong bond activation via &#946;&#8208;heteroatom elimination and redox&#8208;neutral annulation along a PdII/PdIV redox manifold to access 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Various alkyl C(sp3)&#8722;O, N, and S bonds can be selectively activated, allowing for enantioenriched amino acid derivatives and low&#8208;strain heterocycles to be converted into value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
We describe a catalytic cascade sequence involving directed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation followed by &#946;&#8208;heteroatom elimination to generate a PdII(&#960;&#8208;alkene) intermediate that then undergoes redox&#8208;neutral annulation with an ambiphilic aryl halide to access 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)cycles. Various alkyl C(sp3)&#8722;oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur bonds can be selectively activated, and the annulation proceeds with high diastereoselectivity. The method enables modification of amino acids with good retention of enantiomeric excess, as well as &#963;&#8208;bond ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing transfiguration of low&#8208;strain heterocycles. Despite its mechanistic complexity, the method employs simple conditions and is operationally straightforward to perform.

         <title>Cooperative Bimetallic Catalysis via One&#8208;Metal/Two&#8208;Ligands: Mechanistic Insights of Polyfluoroarylation&#8208;Allylation of Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative bimetallic catalysis via one&#8208;metal/two&#8208;ligands in situ assembling is developed in geminal polyfluoroarylation&#8208;allylation of diazo esters, delivering products bearing a 1,1&#8242;&#8208;aryl, polyfluoroaryl quaternary carbon center. Detailed mechanistic investigation disclosed unique roles of two distinct ligands, suggesting two in situ formed Pd complexes display different reactivities and work cooperatively in two catalytic cycles.







Abstract
Metal/ligand in situ assembly is crucial for tailoring the reactivity &amp; selectivity in transition metal catalysis. Cooperative catalysis via a single metal/two ligands is still underdeveloped, since it is rather challenging to harness the distinct reactivity profiles of the species generated by self&#8208;assembly of a single metal precursor with a mixture of different ligands. Herein, we report a catalytic system composed of a single metal/two ligands for a three&#8208;component reaction of polyfluoroarene, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and allylic electrophile, leading to highly efficient construction of densely functionalized quaternary carbon centers, that are otherwise hardly accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest this reaction follows a cooperative bimetallic pathway via two catalysts with distinct reactivity profiles, which are assembled in situ from a single metal precursor and two ligands and work in concert to escort the transformation.

         <title>Divergent Stabilities of Tetravalent Cerium, Uranium, and Neptunium Imidophosphorane Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual redox properties of Ce, U, and Np in a homoleptic imidophosporane ligand field include large cathodic shifts in the M4+/3+ (M=Ce, U, Np) couples and an unprecedented, well&#8208;behaved Np5+/4+ redox couple. This homoleptic ligand field, in effect, shifts the conventional redox stabilities of the mid&#8208;actinides to redefine the readily accessible oxidation states.







Abstract
The study of the redox chemistry of mid&#8208;actinides (U&#8722;Pu) has historically relied on cerium as a model, due to the accessibility of trivalent and tetravalent oxidation states for these ions. Recently, dramatic shifts of lanthanide 4+/3+ non&#8208;aqueous redox couples have been established within a homoleptic imidophosphorane ligand framework. Herein we extend the chemistry of the imidophosphorane ligand (NPC=[N=PtBu(pyrr)2]&#8722;; pyrr=pyrrolidinyl) to tetrahomoleptic NPC complexes of neptunium and cerium (1&#8208;M, 2&#8208;M, M=Np, Ce) and present comparative structural, electrochemical, and theoretical studies of these complexes. Large cathodic shifts in the M4+/3+ (M=Ce, U, Np) couples underpin the stabilization of higher metal oxidation states owing to the strongly donating nature of the NPC ligands, providing access to the U5+/4+, U6+/5+, and to an unprecedented, well&#8208;behaved Np5+/4+ redox couple. The differences in the chemical redox properties of the U vs. Ce and Np complexes are rationalized based on their redox potentials, degree of structural rearrangement upon reduction/oxidation, relative molecular orbital energies, and orbital composition analyses employing density functional theory.

         <title>Bis(1&#8208;Methyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;Carboranyl)Borane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis superacidic secondary borane, bis(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (HBMeoCb2) has been synthesized and is demonstrated to be a very reactive hydroboration reagent. It can perform regioselective 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, a unique 1,1&#8208;hydroboration for acetylenes featuring an aryl and silyl substituent, and the formal 1,3&#8208;hydroboration of cyclopropanes, all without the need of a catalyst.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid, bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane, is rapidly accessed in two steps. It is a very effective hydroboration reagent capable of B&#8722;H addition to alkenes, alkynes, and cyclopropanes. To date, this is the first identified Lewis superacidic secondary borane and most reactive neutral hydroboration reagent.

It can perform regioselective 1,2-hydroboration of carbon-carbon multiple bonds, a unique 1,1-hydroboration for acetylenes featuring an aryl and silyl substituent, and the formal 1,3-hydroboration of cyclopropanes, all without the need of a catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lewis superacid, bis(1-methyl-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-carboranyl)borane, is rapidly accessed in two steps. It is a very effective hydroboration reagent capable of B&#8722;H addition to alkenes, alkynes, and cyclopropanes. To date, this is the first identified Lewis superacidic secondary borane and most reactive neutral hydroboration reagent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Instantaneous Free Radical Scavenging by CeO2 Nanoparticles Adjacent to the Fe&#8722;N4 Active Sites for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2 nanoparticles as radicals scavengers are successfully anchored adjacent to the Fe&#8722;N4 active sites by a two&#8208;step metalorganic gaseous doping approach. Radicals generated at Fe&#8722;N4 sites can be instantaneously scavenged by adjacent CeO2. This greatly improves the scavenging rate of radicals by CeO2 and effectively mitigated the degradation of M&#8722;N molecules by radicals, thus improving the durability of the ORR catalyst.







Abstract
To achieve the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C materials with both high activity and durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the attack of free radicals on Fe&#8722;N4 sites must be overcome. Herein, we report a strategy to effectively eliminate radicals at the source to mitigate the degradation by anchoring CeO2 nanoparticles as radicals scavengers adjacent (Scaad&#8208;CeO2) to the Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Radicals such as &#8901;OH and HO2&#8901; that form at Fe&#8722;N4 sites can be instantaneously eliminated by adjacent CeO2, which shortens the survival time of radicals and the regional space of their damage. As a result, the CeO2 scavengers in Fe&#8722;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 achieved &#8764;80&#8201;% elimination of the radicals generated at the Fe&#8722;N4 sites. A fuel cell prepared with the Fe&#8722;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 showed a smaller peak power density decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles determined with US DOE PGM&#8208;relevant AST, increasing the decay of Fe&#8722;NCPhen from 69&#8201;% to 28&#8201;% decay.

         <title>Direct Light&#8208;Enabled Access to &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Application in the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Allyl Boronic Esters
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Boryl radicals have reemerged as versatile intermediates to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. We disclose a facile activation of &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters using light and a Lewis base to permit homolytic scission. Addition to styrenes allows the construction of E&#8208;allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger with energy transfer catalysis to enable the stereodivergent synthesis of Z&#8208;isomers.







Abstract
Operationally simple strategies to assemble boron containing organic frameworks are highly enabling in organic synthesis. While conventional retrosynthetic logic has engendered many platforms focusing on the direct formation of C&#8722;B bonds, &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals have recently reemerged as versatile open&#8208;shell alternatives to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. Direct light&#8208;enabled &#945;&#8208;activation is currently contingent on photo&#8208; or transition metal&#8208;catalysis activation to efficiently generate radical species. Here, we disclose a facile activation of &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters using only visible light and a simple Lewis base to enable homolytic scission. Intermolecular addition to styrenes facilitates the rapid construction of highly versatile E&#8208;allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger of this construct with selective energy transfer catalysis to enable the complimentary stereodivergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronic esters.

         <title>Evidence for Carbene Intermediates in Isocyanide Homologation by Aluminium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the reaction between a neutral AlI complex (1) and isocyanides as Fischer&#8211;Tropsch model enables the isolation of diverse homologation products, including a pentamolecular coupling product (9). Through combined experimental and computational studies, a step&#8208;by&#8208;step mechanism involving carbenes as key intermediates has been elucidated.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation between C1 molecules plays an important role in chemistry as manifested by the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) process. Serving as models for the FT process, we report here the reactions between a neutral AlI complex (MeNacNac)Al (1, MeNacNac=HC[(CMe)(NDipp)]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and various isocyanides. The step&#8208;by&#8208;step coupling mechanism was studied in detail by low&#8208;temperature NMR monitoring, isotopic labeling, as well as quantum chemical calculations. Three different products were isolated in reaction of 1 with the sterically encumbered 2,6&#8208;bis(benzhydryl)&#8208;4&#8208;Me&#8208;phenyl isocyanide (BhpNC). These products substantiate carbene intermediates. The reaction between 1 and adamantyl isocyanide (AdNC) generated a trimerization product, and a corresponding carbene intermediate could be trapped in the form of a molybdenum(0) complex. Tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and even pentamerization products were isolated with the sterically less congested phenyl and p&#8208;methoxyphenyl isocyanides (PhNC and PMPNC) with concurrent construction of quinoline or indole heterocycles. Overall, this study provides evidence for carbene intermediates in FT&#8208;type chemistry of aluminium(I) and isocyanides.

         <title>Highly Oxidative&#8208;Resistant Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Lithium Borate Salt for Enhanced Cycling Performance of Practical Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly oxidative&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;functionalized lithium borate salt, lithium difluoro(1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) borate (LiDFTCB), is designed to enhance cycling performance of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Owing to its intrinsic anionic structure and the thin and robust electrolyte/electrode layers formed by LiDFTCB, the LiCoO2/graphite cells show superior cycling stability at 50&#8201;&#176;C with barely any CO2 gas evolution.







Abstract
Lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) has been widely investigated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its advantageous thermal stability and excellent aluminum passivation property. However, LiDFOB tends to suffer from severe decomposition and generate a lot of gas species (e.g., CO2). Herein, a novel cyano&#8208;functionalized lithium borate salt, namely lithium difluoro(1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) borate (LiDFTCB), is innovatively synthesized as a highly oxidative&#8208;resistant salt to alleviate above dilemma. It is revealed that the LiDFTCB&#8208;based electrolyte enables LiCoO2/graphite cells with superior capacity retention at both room and elevated temperatures (e.g., 80&#8201;% after 600&#8197;cycles) with barely any CO2 gas evolution. Systematic studies reveal that LiDFTCB tends to form thin and robust interfacial layers at both electrodes. This work emphasizes the crucial role of cyano&#8208;functionalized anions in improving cycle lifespan and safety of practical LIBs.

         <title>Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with Precursor Coisolation Improves Proteome Coverage and Measurement Throughput for Label&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics

A new data acquisition strategy for biological mass spectrometry, termed wide&#8208;window acquisition, combined with efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography, enables single&#8208;cell proteome profiling to an unprecedented depth of &gt;3000 proteins per cell. This advance allows additional classes of proteins to be studied within single cells.







Abstract
We combined efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography with a newly developed data acquisition and analysis scheme termed wide window acquisition (WWA) to quantify &gt;3,000 proteins from single cells in rapid label&#8208;free analyses. WWA employs large isolation windows to intentionally co&#8208;isolate and co&#8208;fragment adjacent precursors along with the selected precursor. Optimized WWA increased the number of MS2&#8208;identified proteins by &#8776;40&#8201;% relative to standard data&#8208;dependent acquisition. For a 40&#8208;min LC gradient operated at &#8776;15 nL/min, we identified an average of 3,524 proteins per single&#8208;cell&#8208;sized aliquot of protein digest. Reducing the active gradient to 20&#8197;min resulted in a modest 10&#8201;% decrease in proteome coverage. Using this platform, we compared protein expression between single HeLa cells having an essential autophagy gene, atg9a, knocked out, with their isogenic WT parental line. Similar proteome coverage was observed, and 268 proteins were significantly up&#8208; or downregulated. Protein upregulation primarily related to innate immunity, vesicle trafficking and protein degradation.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution through Retarded Charge Trapping and Recombination by Continuously Distributed Defects in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defects is proposed to promote the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts for H2 evolution. The continuously distributed defects in the deliberately designed MAPbI3 photocatalysts retard charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance as confirmed by combining the atomic force microscopy&#8208;based infrared and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopies.







Abstract
Inspired by its great success in the photovoltaic field, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) has recently been actively explored as photocatalysts in H2 evolution reactions. However, the practical application of MAPbI3 photocatalysts remains hampered by the intrinsically fast trapping and recombination of photogenerated charges. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defective areas to promote charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts. By deliberately designing and synthesizing the MAPbI3 photocatalysts featuring a unique continuation of defective areas, we demonstrate that such a feature enables retardation of charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance. As an outcome, such MAPbI3 photocatalysts turn out to achieve an impressive photocatalytic H2 evolution rate as high as 0.64&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, one order of magnitude higher than that of the conventional MAPbI3 photocatalysts. This work establishes a new paradigm for controlling charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photocatalysis.

         <title>Photoluminescence Anisotropy in Eutectic Crystals of Polynuclear Lanthanide Complexes and Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eutectic of Ag clusters and polynuclear lanthanide complexes induces fluorescence anisotropy. Investigation of the excitation polarization mechanism confirmed that the electrons in the ground state have higher transition efficiency when the direction of the electric field vibration of the photon and the direction of the molecular electric transition dipole moment are parallel.







Abstract
Anisotropy is an intrinsic property of crystalline materials. However, the photoluminescence anisotropy in eutectic crystals of organometallic complexes has remained unexplored. Herein, the eutectic of polynuclear lanthanide complexes and Ag clusters was prepared, and the crystal shows significant photoluminescence anisotropy. The polarization anisotropy of emission &#948; and degree of excitation polarization P are 2.62 and 0.53, respectively. The rare excitation polarization properties have been proved to be related to the regular arrangement of electric transition dipole moments of luminescent molecules in the crystal. Our design provides a reference for developing new photoluminescence anisotropy materials and expanding their applications.

         <title>Benzidine Derivatives: A Class of High Redox Potential Molecules for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines, a series of water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable high redox potentials (0.78&#8208;1.01&#8197;V vs. SHE) were obtained. The impressive battery performance based on N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraethylbenzidine pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte suggested that benzidine derivatives could be promising catholyte materials for aqueous organic flow batteries.







Abstract
The development of water&#8208;soluble redox&#8208;active molecules with high potentials is one of the effective ways to enhance the energy density of aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). Herein, a series of promising N&#8208;substituted benzidine analogues as water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable redox potentials (0.78&#8211;1.01&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) were obtained by the molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines. Theoretical calculations reveal that the redox potentials of these benzidine derivatives in acidic solution are determined by their electronic structure and alkalinity. Among these benzidine derivatives, N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraethylbenzidine(TEB) shows both high redox potential (0.82&#8197;V vs. SHE) and good solubility (1.1&#8197;M). Pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte, the cell displayed discharge capacity retention of 99.4&#8201;% per cycle and a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of &#8764;100&#8201;% over 1200&#8197;cycles. The stable discharge capacity of 41.8&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 was achieved at the 1.0&#8197;M TEB catholyte with a CE of 97.2&#8201;% and energy efficiency (EE) of 91.2&#8201;%, demonstrating that N&#8208;substituted benzidines could be promising for AOFBs.

         <title>Overlooked Formation of Carbonate Radical Anions in the Oxidation of Iron(II) by Oxygen in the Presence of Bicarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron(II), (Fe(H2O)62+, (Fe(II)) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of Fe(II) oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O2, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO3&#8208;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO3&#8208;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O2&#9679;&#8208;, H2O2, and HO&#9679;) in Fe(II) oxidation by O2 has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#9679;&#8208;) in the oxidation of Fe(II) by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO3&#8208;. The rate of the formation of CO3&#9679;&#8208; may be expressed as d[CO3&#9679;&#8208;]/dt = [Fe(II)[[O2][HCO3&#8208;]2. The formation of reactive species was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of Fe(II) oxidation by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#9679;&#8208; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistor Based on Hydrophobic Polymer Tuned by Ionic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic conjugated polymers have poor ionic transport property, so hydrophilic side chains are often grafted for their application as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, this modification lowers their charge transport ability. Here, an ionic gel interfacial layer is applied to improve the ionic transport while retaining the charge transport ability of the polymers. By using the ionic gels comprising gel matrix and ionic liquids as the interfacial layers, the hydrophobic polymer achieves the OECT feature with high transconductance, low threshold voltage, high current on/off ratio, short switching time, and high operational stability. The working mechanism is also revealed. Moreover, the OECT performance can be tuned by varying the types and ratios of ionic gels. With the proposed ionic gel strategy, OECTs can be effectively realized with hydrophobic conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porous Crystalline Nitrone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, by combining N,&#160;N',&#160;N',&#160;N'''&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl))tetrakis(hydroxylamine)and terephthaladehyde via a polycondensation reaction. The formation of the nitrone functionality was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 13C multi cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy of the 13C&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled COF&#8208;115 and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. The permanent porosity of COF&#8208;115 was evaluated through low&#8208;pressure N2, CO2, and H2 sorption experiments. Water vapor and carbon dioxide sorption analysis of COF&#8208;115 and the isoreticular imine&#8208;linked COF indicated a superior potential of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications. Density functional theory calculations provided valuable insights into the difference between the adsorption properties of these COFs. Lastly, photoinduced rearrangement of COF&#8208;115 to the associated amide&#8208;linked material was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>A Generic Platform for Upcycling Polystyrene to Aryl Ketones and Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polystyrene (PS) is one of the least recycled large&#8208;volume commodity plastics due to bulkiness of foam products and associated contaminants. PS recycling is also severely hampered by the lack of financial incentive, limited versatility, and poor selectivity of existing methods. To this end, herein we report a thermochemical recycling strategy of &#8220;degradation&#8208;upcycling&#8221; to synthesize a library of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals from PS wastes with high versability and selectivity. Two cascade reactions are selected to first degrade PS into benzene under mild temperatures, followed by the derivatization thereof utilizing a variety of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chloride additives. To demonstrate the versatility, nine ketones and sulfides of cosmetic and pharmaceutical relevance were prepared, including propiophenone, benzophenone, and diphenyl sulfide. The approach is also amenable to sophisticated upcycling reaction designs and can produce desired products stepwise. The facile and versatile approach will provide a scalable and profitable methodology for upcycling PS waste into value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of d&#8208;Band Centers in Localized CdS Homojunctions through Facet Control for Improved Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accelerated kinetic behaviour of charge carrier transfer and its unhindered surface reaction dynamic process involving oxygenated&#8208;intermediate activation and conversion are urgently required in photocatalytic water (H2O) overall splitting, which has not been nevertheless resolved yet. Herein, localized CdS homojunctions with optimal collocation of high and low index facets to regulate d&#8208;band center for chemically adsorbing and activating key intermediates (*&#8208;OH and *&#8208;O) have been achieved in H2O overall splitting into hydrogen. Density functional theory, hall effect, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy confirm that, electrons and holes are kinetically transferred to reductive high index facet (002) and oxidative low index facet (110) of the localized CdS homojunction induced by facet Fermi level difference to dehydrogenate *&#8208;OH and couple *&#8208;O for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, along with a solar conversion into hydrogen (STH) of 2.20% by Air Mass 1.5 Global filter irradiation. These findings contribute to solving the kinetic bottleneck issues of photocatalytic H2O splitting, which will further enhance STH.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach for the Synthesis of Natural and Artificial Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many terpenoids with isoprene unit(s) demonstrating critical biological activities have been isolated and characterized. Although there are natural and many artificial methods for their syntheses, there is a great demand for better understanding of the corresponding structure&#8208;activity relationship, efficiency, and diversity. In this work, we have developed a robust chem&#8208;stamp strategy for the construction of the key isoprene unit, which consists of two steps: one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to the alkenyl boronates and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols yielding enals. This chem&#8208;stamp could easily be applied repeatedly and separately, empowering the modular concise syntheses of many natural and pharmaceutically active terpenoids including retinal, &#946;&#8208;carotene, vitamin A, tretinoin, fenretinide, acitretin, ALRT1550, nigerapyrone C, peretinoin, and lycopene. Due to the diversified availability of the starting materials, aldehydes and 2,3&#8208;allenols, creation of new non&#8208;natural terpenoids has been realized from four dimensions: the number of isoprene units, side chain, and two terminal groups.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Metabolic Imaging of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate&#8208;d3 Hyperpolarized By Reversible Exchange With Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non&#8208;invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 for injection in 6 minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non&#8208;toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30 mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11% (residual 250 mM methanol and 20 &#181;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Devising energy&#8208;efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis&#8208;polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (~98%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG&#8208;based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed&#8208;loop recycling characteristics.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Devising energy-efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis-polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (~98%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG-based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed-loop recycling characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low Pressure Carbonylation of Benzyl Carbonates and Carbamates for Applications in 13C Isotope Labeling and Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a methodology to access isotopically labeled esters and amides from carbonates and carbamates employing an oxygen deletion strategy. This methodology utilizes a decarboxylative carbonylation approach for isotope labeling with near stoichiometric, ex situ generated 12C, or 13C carbon monoxide. This reaction is characterized by its broad scope, functional group tolerance, and high yields, which is showcased with the synthesis of structurally complex molecules. A complementary method that operates by the catalytic in situ generation of CO via the reduction of CO2 liberated during decarboxylation has also been developed as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach that CO2&#8208;derived compounds can be converted to CO&#8208;containing frameworks. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the catalytic steps which highlight the impact of ligand choice to overcome challenges associated with low&#8208;pressure carbonylation methodologies, along with rational for the development of future methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Trimming Crystallizable Fragment (Fc) Glycans Enables the Direct Enzymatic Transfer of Biomacromolecules to Antibodies as Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoengineering has provided powerful tools to construct site&#8208;specific antibody conjugates. However, only small&#8208;molecule payloads can be directly transferred to native or engineered antibodies using existing glycoengineering strategies. Herein, we demonstrate that reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment (Fc) glycan could dramatically boost the chemoenzymatic modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) via an engineered fucosyltransferase. In this platform, antibodies with Fc glycans engineered to a simple N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) disaccharide are successfully conjugated to biomacromolecules, such as oligonucleotides and nanobodies, in a single step within hours. Accordingly, we synthesized an antibody&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ cluster of differentiation (CD) 3 bispecific antibody and used it to selectively destroy patient&#8208;derived cancer organoids by reactivating endogenous T lymphocyte cells (T cells) inside the organoid. Our results highlight that this platform is a general approach to construct antibody&#8208;biomacromolecule conjugates with translational values.</dc:description>

         <title>A Broad Light&#8208;Harvesting Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Enables Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in a Bacterial Biohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a rationally designed membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), namely&#160;COE&#8208;IC, which&#160;endows&#160;aerobic N2&#8208;fixing bacteriaAzotobacter vinelandii&#160;with a light&#8208;harvesting ability that enables photosynthetic&#160;ammonia production.&#160;COE&#8208;IC&#160;possesses an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) type conjugated core, which promotes visible light absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore,&#160;COE&#8208;IC&#160;spontaneously associates with&#160;A. vinelandii&#160;to form a biohybrid in which the COE is intercalated within the lipid bilayer membrane. In the presence of L&#8208;ascorbate as a sacrificial electron donor, the resulting&#160;COE&#8208;IC/A. vinelandii&#160;biohybrid showed a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in light&#8208;driven ammonia production, as compared to the control. Photoinduced enhancement of bacterial biomass and production of L&#8208;amino acids is also observed. Introduction&#160;of isotopically enriched&#160;15N2&#160;atmosphere led to the enrichment of&#160;15N&#8208;containing&#160;intracellular metabolites, consistent with the products being generated from&#160;atmospheric N2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane Tension&#8208;Responsive Mechanosensitive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane curvature reflects physical forces operating on the lipid membrane, which plays important roles in cellular processes. Here, we design a mechanosensitive DNA (MSD) nanomachine that mimics natural mechanosensitive PIEZO channels to convert the membrane tension changes of lipid vesicles with different sizes into fluorescence signals in real time. The MSD nanomachine consists of an archetypical six&#8208;helix&#8208;bundle DNA nanopore, cholesterol&#8208;based membrane anchors, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, spiropyran (SP). We find that the DNA nanopore effectively amplifies subtle variations of the membrane tension, which effectively induces the isomerization of weakly emissive SP into highly emissive merocyanine isomers for visualizing membrane tension changes. By measuring the membrane tension via the fluorescence of MSD nanomachine, we establish the correlation between the membrane tension and the curvature that follows the Young&#8208;Laplace equation. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;enabled strategy opens new routes to studying membrane mechanics in physiological and pathological settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomerized Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted wide research attention in the past decades. Very recently, oligomerized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (OFREAs) have emerged as a promising alternative to small&#8208;molecular/polymeric acceptor&#8208;based OSCs due to their unique advantages such as well&#8208;defined structures, batch reproducibility, good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability. So far, rapid advances have been made in the development of OFREAs consisting of directly/rigidly/flexibly linked oligomers and fused ones. In this minireview, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of OFREAs, including structural diversity, synthesis approach,&#160;&#160;molecular conformation and packing, and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, we conclude with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this review will encourage the development of novel OFREAs for OSC applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triazinium Ligation: Bioorthogonal Reaction of N1&#8208;Alkyl 1,2,4&#8208;Triazinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of reagents that can selectively react in complex biological media is an important challenge. Here we show that N1&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines yields the corresponding triazinium salts, which are three orders of magnitude more reactive in reactions with strained alkynes than the parent 1,2,4&#8208;triazines. This powerful bioorthogonal ligation enables efficient modification of peptides and proteins. The positively charged N1&#8208;alkyl triazinium salts exhibit favorable cell permeability, which makes them superior for intracellular fluorescent labeling applications when compared to analogous 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Due to their high reactivity, stability, synthetic accessibility and improved water solubility, the new ionic heterodienes represent a valuable addition to the repertoire of existing modern bioorthogonal reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Control of Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light Transparency Based on Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Association of Tetrathiafulvalene Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The light&#8208;transmissive properties of a solid&#8208;state tetrathiafulvalene radical cation&#8211;bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 1&#8208;C5&#8226;+&#8226;NTf2&#8211;, underwent instantaneous changes in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region (1000&#8211;2500 nm) due to upon exposure to solvent vapor or the application of mechanostress at room temperature. The initial solid state of 1&#8208;C5&#8226;+&#8226;NTf2&#8211; exhibited strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR; 700&#8211;1000 nm) and SWIR regions, whereas the absorption in the SWIR region was significantly diminished in the stimulated state induced by dichloromethane vapor. Upon cessation of vapor stimulation, the solid state spontaneously and promptly reverted to its original state, characterized by absorption bands in the NIR/SWIR region. Moreover, the SWIR absorption was absent upon the application of mechanical stress using a steel spatula. The reversal was fast and occurred within 10 s. These changes were visualized using a SWIR imaging camera under 1450&#8208;nm light irradiation. Experimental investigations demonstrated that the transparency to the SWIR light in the solid states was modulated through significant structural transformations of the associated radical cations, with transitions between columnar and isolated &#960;&#8208;dimer structures under ambient and stimulated conditions, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Active Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Cage for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potential clean method, but the long distance between the oxidation and reduction sites in photocatalysts hinders the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges. Here, a metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst, Co14(L&#8208;CH3)24, is constructed by directly coordinating metal sites (Co sites) used for O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with non&#8208;metallic sites (imidazole sites of ligands) used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR), which shortens the transport path of photogenerated electrons and holes, and improves the transport efficiency of charges and activity of photocatalyst. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for H2O2 production under O2&#8208;saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time, that is, to build a synergistic metal&#8208;nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host&#8208;guest chemistry inherent in MOC to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytic active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triphosphate Pronucleotide (TriPPPro)&#160;Reporter with Optimized Cell&#8208;Permeable Dyes for Metabolic Labeling of Cellular and Viral DNA in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metabolic labeling of nucleic acids in living cells is highly desirable to track the dynamics of nucleic acid metabolism in real&#8208;time and has the potential to provide novel insights into cellular biology as well as pathogen&#8208;host interactions. Catalyst&#8208;free inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions (iEDDA) with nucleosides carrying highly reactive moieties such as axial 2&#8208;trans&#8208;cyclooctene (2TCOa) would be an ideal tool to allow intracellular labeling of DNA. However, cellular kinase phosphorylation of the modified nucleosides is needed after cellular uptake as triphosphates are not membrane permeable. Unfortunately, the narrow substrate window of most endogenous kinases limits the use of highly reactive moieties. Here, we apply our TriPPPro (triphosphate pronucleotide) approach to directly deliver a highly reactive 2TCOa&#8208;modified 2'&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate reporter into living cells. We show that this nucleoside triphosphate is metabolically incorporated into de novo synthesized cellular and viral DNA and can be labeled with highly reactive and cell&#8208;permeable fluorescent dye&#8208;tetrazine conjugates via iEDDA to visualize DNA in living cells directly. Thus, we present the first comprehensive method for live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular and viral nucleic acids using a two&#8208;step labeling approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Alkylureido Imidazole Artificial Water Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature creates aquaporins to effectively transport water, rejecting all ions including protons. Aquaporins (AQPs) has brought inspiration for the development of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). Imidazole&#8208;quartet (I&#8208;quartet) was the first AWC that enabled to self&#8208;assemble a tubular backbone for rapid water and proton permeation with total ion rejection. Here, we report the discovery of bis&#8208;alkylureido imidazole compounds, which outperform the I&#8208;quartets by exhibiting ~3 times higher net and single channel permeabilities (107 H2O/s/channel) and &#160;a ~2&#8208;3 times lower proton conductance. The higher water conductance regime is associated to the high partition of more hydrophobic bis&#8208;alkylureido channels in the membrane and to their pore sizes, experiencing larger fluctuations, leading to an increase in the number of water molecules in the channel, with decreasing H&#8208;bonding connectivity. This new class of AWCs will open new pathways toward scalable membranes with enhanced water transport performances.</dc:description>

         <title>The Crucial Role of Sb2F10 in the Chemical Synthesis of F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The purely chemical synthesis of fluorine is a spectacular reaction which for more than a century had been believed to be impossible. In 1986, it was finally experimentally achieved, but since then this important reaction has not been further studied and its detailed mechanism had been a mystery. The known thermal stability of MnF4 casts serious doubts on the originally proposed hypothesis that MnF4 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to a lower manganese fluoride and F2. This apparent discrepancy has now been resolved experimentally and by electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the reductive elimination of F2 requires a large excess of SbF5 and occurs in the last reaction step when in the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11] the addition of one more SbF5 molecule to the [SbF6]&#8722; anion generates a second tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anion. The two tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anions then provide six fluorine bridges to the Mn(II) cation thereby facilitating the reductive elimination of the two fluorine ligands as F2.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoter&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Cyclic Mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclodextrins are widely used as carriers of small molecules for drug delivery due to their remarkable host properties and excellent biocompatibility. However, cyclic oligosaccharides with different sizes and shapes are limited. Cycloglycosylation of ultra&#8208;large bifunctional saccharide precursors is challenging due to the constrained conformational spaces. Here we report a promoter&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach for the synthesis of cyclic &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer. Cycloglycosylation of the bifunctional thioglycosides and (Z)&#8208;ynenoates was found to be highly dependent on the promoters. In particular, sufficient amount of gold(I) complex played a key role in the proper preorganization of the ultra&#8208;large cyclic transition state, providing a cyclic 32&#8208;mer polymannoside, which represents the largest synthetic cyclic polysaccharide to date. NMR experiments and computational study revealed that the cyclic 2&#8208;mer, 4&#8208;mer, 8&#8208;mer, 16&#8208;mer, and 32&#8208;mer mannosides adopted different conformational states and shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Dendritic Hyperbranched Polyacrylates and Their Topological Block Polymers by Organotellurium&#8208;Mediated Emulsion Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical synthesis of structurally controlled hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) by organotellurium&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (TERP) in water under emulsion conditions is reported. Copolymerization of vinyltelluride named evolmer, which induces controlled branch structure, and acrylates with TERP chain transfer agent (CTA) in water afforded HBPs having dendron structure. The molecular weight, dispersity, branch number, and branch length of the HBPs were controlled by changing the amount of CTA, evolmer, and acrylate monomers. HB&#8208;poly(butyl acrylate)s (HBPBAs) with up to the 8th generation having an average of 255 branches were successfully synthesized. As the monomer conversion reached nearly quantitative and the obtained polymer particles were well dispersed in water, the method is highly suitable for synthesizing topological block polymers, block polymers consisting of different topologies. Thus, linear&#8208;block&#8208;HB, HB&#8208;block&#8208;linear, and HB&#8208;block&#8208;HB&#8208;PBAs with the controlled structure were successfully synthesized by adding the second monomer(s) to the macro&#8208;CTA. The intrinsic viscosity of the resulting homo&#8208; and topological block PBAs was systematically controlled by the degree of the branch, the branch length, and the topology. Therefore, the method opens the possibility of obtaining various HBPs with diverse branch structures and tuning the polymer properties by the polymer topology.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The practical synthesis of structurally controlled hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) by organotellurium-mediated radical polymerization (TERP) in water under emulsion conditions is reported. Copolymerization of vinyltelluride named evolmer, which induces controlled branch structure, and acrylates with TERP chain transfer agent (CTA) in water afforded HBPs having dendron structure. The molecular weight, dispersity, branch number, and branch length of the HBPs were controlled by changing the amount of CTA, evolmer, and acrylate monomers. HB-poly(butyl acrylate)s (HBPBAs) with up to the 8th generation having an average of 255 branches were successfully synthesized. As the monomer conversion reached nearly quantitative and the obtained polymer particles were well dispersed in water, the method is highly suitable for synthesizing topological block polymers, block polymers consisting of different topologies. Thus, linear-block-HB, HB-block-linear, and HB-block-HB-PBAs with the controlled structure were successfully synthesized by adding the second monomer(s) to the macro-CTA. The intrinsic viscosity of the resulting homo- and topological block PBAs was systematically controlled by the degree of the branch, the branch length, and the topology. Therefore, the method opens the possibility of obtaining various HBPs with diverse branch structures and tuning the polymer properties by the polymer topology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic enzymes present excellent opportunities for the treatment of human disease, modulation of metabolic pathways and system detoxification. However, current use of enzyme therapy in the clinic is limited as naturally occurring enzymes are seldom optimal for such applications and require substantial improvement by protein engineering. Engineering strategies such as design and directed evolution that have been successfully implemented for industrial biocatalysts can significantly advance the field of therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new&#8208;to&#8208;nature therapeutic activities, high selectivity, and suitability for medical applications. This minireview highlights case studies of how state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging methods in protein engineering are explored for the generation of therapeutic enzymes and discusses gaps and future opportunities in the field of enzyme therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;growing organic materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth of living systems is ubiquitous. Living organisms could continually update their sizes, shapes, and properties to meet various environmental challenges. Such a capability is also demonstrated by emerging self&#8208;growing materials that can incorporate externally&#8208;provided compounds to grow as living organisms. In this minireview, we sum these materials from six aspects. First, we discuss their essential characteristics in the introduction section, then describe the strategies for enabling crosslinked organic materials to self&#8208;grow from nutrient solutions containing polymerizable compounds. The developed examples are concluded into five categories based on their molecular mechanisms in this section. In the third section, we explain the mechanism of mass transport within polymer networks during growth, which is critical to controlling the shape and morphology of the grown products. Afterward, simulation models built to explain the interesting phenomena observed in self&#8208;growing materials are discussed. The development of self&#8208;growing materials is accompanied by various fantastic applications, including tuning material&#8217;s bulk properties, creating texture surfaces, growth&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, 4D printing, self&#8208;growing implants, actuation, self&#8208;growing structural coloration, etc. These examples are summed up in the fifth section. Finally, we discuss the opportunities brought by self&#8208;growing materials and their facing challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Dynamic Bonds&#8208;Driven Integrated Cathode/Polymer Electrolyte for Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as the promising higher&#8208;energy and improved&#8208;safety energy&#8208;storage systems. Nevertheless, the electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial issues due to the limited solid physical contact lead to discontinuous interfacial charge transport and large interfacial resistance, thereby suffering from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, we construct an integrated cathode/polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs under the action of polymer chains exchange and recombination originating from multiple dynamic bonds in our well&#8208;designed dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers (DSICE) molecular structure. The DSICE acts as polymer electrolytes with excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical properties, achieving the ultrathin pure polymer electrolyte thickness (12 &#956;m). Notably, the DSICE also functions as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) cathode binders with enhanced adhesive capability. Such well&#8208;constructed Li|DSICE|LFP&#8208;DSICE cells generate delicate electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial contact at the molecular level, providing continuous Li+ transport pathways and promoting uniform Li+ deposition, further delivering superior long&#8208;term charge/discharge stability (&gt;600 cycles, Coulombic efficiency, &gt;99.8%) and high capacity retention (80% after 400 cycles). More practically, the Li|DSICE|LFP&#8208;DSICE pouch cells show stable electrochemical performance, excellent flexibility and safety under abusive tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking a FeV(O) Intermediate for Water Oxidation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species are appealing in conducting O&#8211;O bond formation for water oxidation reaction. However, their high reactivity poses a great challenge to dissection of their chemical transformations. Herein, we introduce an electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand, 2&#8208;[(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;6&#8208;yl]propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol to stabilize such fleeting intermediates. Advanced spectroscopies and electrochemical studies demonstrate a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species formation in water. Combining kinetic and oxygen isotope labelling experiments and organic reactions indicates that the FeV(O) species is responsible for O&#8211;O bond formation via water nucleophilic attack under the real catalytic water oxidation condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Association of Radical Chemistry with LanD Flavoprotein Activity for C&#8208;Terminal Macrocyclization of a Ribosomal Peptide by Formation of an Unsaturated Thioether Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the C&#8208;terminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce an enethiol. This enethiol is highly reactive and can be coupled with an upstream dehydroamino acid through Michael addition to form S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)&#8208;cysteine, an unsaturated thioether residue known to be characteristic of an array of C&#8208;terminally macrocyclized, ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Based on a two&#8208;stage bioinformatics mining of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) related to C&#8208;terminal Cys processing, we here report that LanD activity can couple radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine chemistry to provide a new unsaturated thioether residue, S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;3&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;cysteine, by conjugating the resultant enethiol with C&#946;&#160;of the Asn residue in the C&#8208;terminal NxxC motif of a peptide for macrocyclization. This study furthers the appreciation of the variety of PTMs in creating the structure diversity of macrocyclic RiPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Non&#8208;radiative Recombination Energy Losses in Asymmetric Acceptors based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) is one key to boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells. Although the recent studies have indicated that the Y&#8208;series asymmetric acceptors&#8208;based devices featured relative low &#916;E3, the understanding of the energy loss mechanism derived from molecular structure change is still lagging behind. Herein, two asymmetric acceptors named BTP&#8208;Cl and BTP&#8208;2Cl with different terminals were synthesized to make a clear comparative study with the symmetric acceptor BTP&#8208;0Cl. Our results suggest that asymmetric acceptors exhibit a larger difference of electrostatic potential (ESP) in terminals and semi&#8208;molecular dipole moment, which contributes to form a stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. Besides, the experimental and theoretical studies reveal that a lower ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular interaction can reduce the distribution of PM6 near the interface to enhance the built&#8208;in potential and decrease the charge transfer state ratio for asymmetric acceptors. Therefore, the devices achieve a higher exciton dissociation efficiency and lower &#916;E3. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and provides a new perspective to understand the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art asymmetric acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Salts Containing Cationic Al24&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Acetate Clusters from Scalable, Green and Aqueous Synthesis Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The systematic high&#8208;throughput investigation of the system AlCl3/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O led to the discovery of a series of porous salts from readily available starting materials in high yields. In situ crystallisation studies confirm the rapid formation of the highly crystalline compounds within minutes under mild conditions.







Abstract
The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al24 cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]X4, denoted CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X, with X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, HSO4&#8722;. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]Cl4 in water were established resulting in high yields (&gt;95&#8201;%, 215&#8197;g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H2O capacities with maximum values of up to 930&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 430&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 are observed. The particle size of CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X can be tuned between 140&#8197;nm and 1250&#8197;nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders. The positive surface charge of the particles, allow fast and effective adsorption of anionic dye molecules and adsorption of poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

         <title>Chemical Modification of a Bacterial Siderophore by a Competitor in Dual&#8208;Species Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed investigation of the inter&#8208;species chemical communication between the human pathogens P. aeruginosa and S. aureus revealed that S. aureus converts pyochelin, an important siderophore secreted by P. aeruginosa, to its less potent pyochelin methyl ester (PME). In addition, PME is sensed by P. aeruginosa and affects metabolite expression, indicating a potential role as signaling molecule for both species.







Abstract
Chemical communication between competing bacteria in multi&#8208;species environments often enables both species to adapt and survive, and perhaps even thrive. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are two bacterial pathogens found in natural biofilms, especially in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where recent studies showed that there is often cooperation between the two species, leading to increased disease severity and antibiotic resistance. However, the mechanisms behind this cooperation are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed co&#8208;cultured biofilms in various settings, and we applied untargeted mass spectrometry&#8208;based metabolomics analyses, combined with synthetic validation of candidate compounds. We unexpectedly discovered that S. aureus can convert pyochelin into pyochelin methyl ester, an analogue of pyochelin with reduced affinity for iron (III). This conversion allows S. aureus to coexist more readily with P. aeruginosa and unveils a mechanism underlying the formation of robust dual&#8208;species biofilms.

         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Transfer Events in [Fe4Co4] Cubes via a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Approach: The Impact of Elastic Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cubes were prepared via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. The molecular origins of their distinct (incomplete vs. complete) metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) properties were identified as the presence and absence of the inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl and CH/&#960; interactions. These compete with the cluster&#8208;anion interactions, resulting in the underlying elastic frustration and stopping the complete spin transition in 1.







Abstract
The engineering of intermolecular interaction is challenging but critical for magnetically switchable molecules. Here, we prepared two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cube complexes via the alkynyl&#8208; and alcohol&#8208;functionalized trispyrazoyl capping ligands. The alkynyl&#8208;functionalized complex 1 exhibited a thermally&#8208;induced incomplete metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) behaviour at around 220&#8197;K, while the mixed alkynyl/alcohol&#8208;functionalized cube of 2 showed a complete and abrupt MMET behaviour at 232&#8197;K. Remarkably, both compounds showed a long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;induced metastable state up to 200&#8197;K. The crystallographic study demonstrated that the incomplete transition of 1 was likely due to the possible elastic frustration originating from the competition between the anion&#8208;propagated elastic interactions and inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl &amp; CH&#8208;alkynyl interactions, whereas the latter are eliminated in 2 as a result of the partial substitution by the alcohol&#8208;functionalized ligand. Additionally, the introduction of chemically distinguishable cobalt centers within the cube unit of 2 did not lead to a two&#8208;step but a one&#8208;step transition, possibly because of the strong ferroelastic intramolecular interaction through the cyanide bridges.

         <title>Investigating the Role of Vacancies on the Thermoelectric Properties of EuCuSb&#8208;Eu2ZnSb2 Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermoelectric properties of the EuCuSb&#8208;EuZn0.5Sb solid solution. Vacancies in the planar honeycomb lattice cause a decrease in sound velocity and a sharp increase in point defect scattering, which combine to yield an 80&#8201;% decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as the composition changes from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.







Abstract
AMX compounds with the ZrBeSi structure tolerate a vacancy concentration of up to 50&#8201;% on the M&#8208;site in the planar MX&#8208;layers. Here, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermal and electronic properties across the full EuCu1&#8722;xZn0.5xSb solid solution. The transition from a fully&#8208;occupied honeycomb layer (EuCuSb) to one with a quarter of the atoms missing (EuZn0.5Sb) leads to non&#8208;linear bond expansion in the honeycomb layer, increasing atomic displacement parameters on the M and Sb&#8208;sites, and significant lattice softening. This, combined with a rapid increase in point defect scattering, causes the lattice thermal conductivity to decrease from 3 to 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The effect of vacancies on the electronic properties is more nuanced; we see a small increase in effective mass, large increase in band gap, and decrease in carrier concentration. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as we go from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.

         <title>Development of Tough Thermoplastic Elastomers by Leveraging Rigid&#8211;Flexible Supramolecular Segment Interplays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative strategy for toughening thermoplastic elastomers without toughness&#8211;strength trade&#8208;off limitations is developed by leveraging the interplays between rigid and flexible supramolecular segments, resulting in the toughest (toughness 1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3) thermoplastic elastomer thus far. This work presents a general design principle for toughening polymer materials by mismatched supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions facilitate the development of tough multifunctional thermoplastic elastomers. However, the fundamental principles that govern supramolecular toughening are barely understood, and the rational design to achieve the desired high toughness remains daunting. Herein, we report a simple and robust method for toughening thermoplastic elastomers by rationally tailoring hard&#8211;soft phase separation structures containing rigid and flexible supramolecular segments. The introduced functional segments with distinct structural rigidities provide mismatched supramolecular interactions to efficiently tune the energy dissipation and bear an external load. The optimal supramolecular elastomer containing aromatic amide and acylsemicarbazide moieties demonstrates a record toughness (1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), extraordinary crack tolerance (fracture energy 282.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), an ultrahigh true stress at break (2.3&#8197;GPa), good elasticity, healing ability, recyclability, and impact resistance. The toughening mechanism is validated by testing various elastomers, confirming the potential for designing and developing super&#8208;tough supramolecular materials with promising applications in aerospace and electronics.

         <title>Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a *H&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction from CO2RR. The findings reveal that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 in Cu&#8208;based catalyst could accelerate water dissociation and tailor *H intermediate coverage, which favors hydrogenation of the *HCCOH to ethanol. This study directs a feasible avenue for mediating *H intermediate coverage and tailoring *H&#8208;involved reduction reaction pathways on an efficient and durable Cu&#8208;based oxide catalyst.







Abstract
The direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products offers a promising pathway for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. However, producing ethanol remains a challenge because of the competitive ethylene formation and hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, we propose an active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction on a layered precursor&#8208;derived CuAl2O4/CuO catalyst. The catalyst delivered a Faradaic efficiency of 70&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products and 41&#8201;% for ethanol at current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibited a continuous 150&#8197;h durability in a flow cell. The intensive spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 could tailor *H intermediate coverage and the elevated *H coverage favors the hydrogenation of the *HCCOH intermediate, accounting for the increased yield of ethanol. This work directs a pathway for enhancing ethanol electroproduction from CO2 reduction by tailoring *H intermediate coverage.

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOFs Confining Zwitterionic Sulfamic Acid as Proton Source and Conducting Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic loading of dual&#8208;functioning zwitterionic sulfamic acid in MOFs leads to proton conductivity of the order of 10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This high conductivity is the result of higher loading of sulfamic acid, which can act as both a proton source due to its acidity and a conducting medium due to its extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability and zwitterion effect.







Abstract
A few metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which typically use strong acids as proton sources, display superprotonic conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1); however, they are rare due to the instability of MOFs in highly acidic conditions. For the first time, we report superprotonic conductivity using a moderately acidic guest, zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA), which is encapsulated in MOF&#8208;808 and MIL&#8208;101. HSA acts not only as a proton source but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium due to its extensive hydrogen bonding ability and zwitterion effect. A new sustained concentration gradient method results in higher HSA encapsulation compared to conventional methods, producing 10HSA@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(bSA)2 and 8HSA@MIL&#8208;101. These MOFs show impressive superprotonic conductivity of 2.47&#215;10&#8722;1 and 3.06&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, respectively, at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity, and maintain stability for 7&#8197;days.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Benzothiophenes at C4 by Activation as their Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiophenes are key structures in materials and medicines and methods for their selective C&#8722;H functionalization are highly prized. Activation of benzothiophenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at C3 as their S&#8208;oxides enables formal C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling with phenols to access C4 arylated benzothiophenes. Computational studies suggest the intermediacy of a &#960;&#8208;complex between the benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation.







Abstract
Benzothiophenes, activated by oxidation to the corresponding S&#8208;oxides, undergo C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H&#8208;type coupling with phenols to give C4 arylation products. While an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C3 of the benzothiophene is important, the process operates without a directing group and a metal catalyst, thus rendering it compatible with sensitive functionalities&#8212;e.g. halides and formyl groups. Quantum chemical calculations suggest a formal stepwise mechanism involving heterolytic cleavage of an aryloxysulfur species to give a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation. Subsequent addition of the phenoxonium cation to the C4 position of the benzothiophene is favored over the addition to C3; Fukui functions predict that the major regioisomer is formed at the more electron&#8208;rich position between C3 and C4. Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal&#8208;free arylation process.

         <title>A Kinetically Stabilized Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Triangulene Cation: Stable and NIR Fluorescent Diradical Cation with Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated. It is highly stable even in solution under air and has a triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation.







Abstract
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated as the stable diradical with a triplet ground state that exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission. As was the case for a triangulene derivative we previously synthesized, the triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was experimentally confirmed by magnetic measurements. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative is highly stable even in solution under air and exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation. Breaking the alternancy symmetry of triplet alternant hydrocarbon diradicals by a nitrogen cation would therefore be an effective strategy to create stable diradicals possessing magnetic properties similar to the parent hydrocarbons but with different electrochemical and photophysical properties.

         <title>An Aqueous Electrolyte Gated Artificial Synapse with Synaptic Plasticity Selectively Mediated by Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial synapse where non&#8208;relevant biomolecules (urea, lactic acid (LA) and fructose (Fru)) cannot modulate its plasticity, while only relevant biomolecules (glucose) can selectively activate the device and induce long&#8208;term modulation and memory effect. The device works properly in blood serum and shows enhanced synaptic behaviors at high glucose concentrations, suggesting its potential application as artificial neurons in vivo.







Abstract
The emulation of functions and behaviors of biological synapses using electronic devices has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in biomedical interfaces. Despite the achievements, artificial synapses that can be selectively responsive to non&#8208;electroactive biomolecules and directly operate in biological environments are still lacking. Herein, we report an artificial synapse based on organic electrochemical transistors and investigate the selective modulation of its synaptic plasticity by glucose. The enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase results in long&#8208;term modulation of the channel conductance, mimicking selective binding of biomolecules to their receptors and consequent long&#8208;term modulation of the synaptic weight. Moreover, the device shows enhanced synaptic behaviors in the blood serum at a higher glucose concentration, which suggests its potential application in vivo as artificial neurons. This work provides a step towards the fabrication of ANNs with synaptic plasticity selectively mediated by biomolecules for neuro&#8208;prosthetics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Alkoxide Powered Zincation of Fluoroarenes Employing Zinc Bis&#8208;Amide Zn(TMP)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the metalation potential of Zn(TMP)2 the addition of KOtBu enables the activation of its amide groups to promote the regioselective zincation of a range of fluoroarenes forming higher order potassium zincates. This methodology can even be extended to non&#8208;activated arenes toluene and benzene under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Reminiscent of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser superbase recipes, the addition of two molar equivalents of KOtBu to Zn(TMP)2 (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) transforms this mild zinc bis&#8208;amide base to a powerful metalating agent able to perform facile regioselective zincation of a wide range of sensitive fluoroarenes. Structural authentication of the intermediates post Zn&#8722;H exchange demonstrates activation of both TMP groups to form a range of higher order bis&#8208;aryl potassium zincates, isolable as solids and further functionalized in electrophilic interception reactions. Studies assessing the role of KOtBu reveal that the first equivalent undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Zn(TMP)2, enabling kinetic activation of the amide groups; whereas the second equivalent stabilizes the metalated intermediate preventing ligand redistribution. Showcasing its metalating power, this bimetallic KOtBu/Zn(TMP)2 partnership, can effect zincation of toluene and benzene at room temperature.

         <title>Covalently Linked Hexakis(m&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Macrocycles as Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for constructing organic nanotubes with defined lengths was developed by designing and synthesizing macrocycles with a &#946;&#8208;alanine linker. Oligomeric hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) macrocycles with four macrocyclic units as molecular nanotubes can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;s.







Abstract
The construction of nanotubular structures with non&#8208;deformable inner pores is of both fundamental and practical significance. Herein we report a strategy for creating molecular nanotubes with defined lengths. Macrocyclic (MC) units based on shape&#8208;persistent hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (m&#8208;PE) macrocycle MC&#8208;1, which are known to stack into hydrogen&#8208;bonded tubular assemblies, are tethered by oligo(&#946;&#8208;alanine) linkers to give tubular stacks MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 that have two and four MC units, respectively. The covalently linked MC units in MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 undergo face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking through intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions that further results in the helical stacks of these compounds. Oligomer MC&#8208;4 can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;seconds, which is among the longest open durations for synthetic ion channels and indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the self&#8208;assembling channels can be drastically enhanced by reducing the number of molecular components involved. This study demonstrates that covalently tethering shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units is a feasible and reliable approach for building molecular nanotubes that otherwise are difficult to create de novo. The extraordinarily long lifetimes of the ion channels formed by MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 suggest the likelihood of constructing the next&#8208;generation synthetic ion channels with unprecedented stability.

         <title>Dynamic Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Communication Mechanism in Poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s under External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix inversion of chiral poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylenes was induced by a dynamic axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism. It was produced by on/off supramolecular interactions between conformationally rigid chiral pendants and bulky molecules.







Abstract
Helix inversion in chiral dynamic helical polymers is usually achieved by conformational changes at the pendant groups induced through external stimuli. Herein, a different mechanism of helix inversion in poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented, based on the activation/deactivation of supramolecular interactions. We prepared poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s (PAEPAs) in which the pendant groups are conformationally locked chiral allenes. Therefore, their substituents are placed in specific spatial orientations. As a result, the screw sense of a PAEPA is fixed by the allenyl substituent with the optimal size/distance relationship to the backbone. This helical sense command can be surpassed by supramolecular interactions between another substituent on the allene and appropriate external stimuli, such as amines. So, a helix inversion occurs through a novel axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism, opening a new scenario for taming the helices of chiral dynamic helical polymers.

         <title>Customizable Supraparticles Constructed from Catechol&#8208;Terminated Molecular Building Blocks with Controllable Intermolecular Interactions
</title>

         <dc:description>
By systematically introducing multiple assembly strategies into the construction of customizable supraparticles based on catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks, conventional supraparticles were endowed with structural and functional customization. This strategy paves a way for building multiscale super&#8208;assembled materials with high degrees of structural complexity and functional diversity.







Abstract
Colloidal supraparticles integrated with multicomponent primary particles come with emerging or synergetic functionalities. However, achieving the functional customization of supraparticles remains a great challenge because of the limited options of building blocks with tailorability and functional extensibility. Herein, we developed a universal approach to construct customizable supraparticles with desired properties from molecular building blocks obtained by the covalent conjugation of catechol groups with a series of orthogonal functional groups. These catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks can assemble into primary particles driven by various intermolecular interactions (i.e. metal&#8208;organic coordination, host&#8211;guest, and hydrophobic interactions), and then further assemble into supraparticles governed by catechol&#8208;mediated interfacial interactions. Our strategy enables the formation of supraparticles with diverse functionalities, such as dual&#8208;pH responsiveness, light&#8208;controllable permeability, and non&#8208;invasive fluorescence labeling of living cells. The ease with which these supraparticles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chemical and physical properties through the choice of metals and orthogonal functional groups used, should enable a variety of applications.

         <title>A Significant Two&#8208;Dimensional Structural Transformation in a Coordination Polymer that Changes Its Electronic and Protonic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D structural transformation with a significant change in the coordination environment within the 2D layer was achieved in a copper&#8208;based coordination polymer in water at room temperature. The transformation led to large changes in the physical properties of the coordination polymers, such as proton conductivity and magnetism.







Abstract
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D (2D: two&#8208;dimensional) structural transformation accompanying significant bond rearrangement and coordination environment change is demonstrated in a coordination polymer (CP) comprised of copper(II) ions and terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;) ligands for the first time. When immersed in water, a free&#8208;standing membrane of 2D Cu(BDC)(DMF) (Cu&#8208;1; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide) transforms into 2D Cu(BDC)(H2O)2 (Cu&#8208;2) while maintaining its highly oriented layered structure. In the 2D sheet, paddlewheel&#8208;type CuII dimers coordinated with four bidentate BDC ligands in a square&#8208;planar array in Cu&#8208;1 were released to form uniform aqua&#8208;bridged CuII chains, which are cross&#8208;linked with each other by unidentate BDC ligands, in Cu&#8208;2. The present facile approach to implement the 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transformation accompanied by bond rearrangement, which is characteristic of CPs, leads to a marked increase in in&#8208;plane magnetic susceptibility and proton conductivity. In situ experiments in support of theoretical calculations unveiled the energy diagram that governs the unique structural transformation.

         <title>Optimizing Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction via Interfacial Electric Field Modulation: Elevating d&#8208;Band Center in WS2&#8208;WO3 for Enhanced Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 can enhance the adsorption of intermediates by elevating the d&#8208;band center of W, resulting in an accelerated electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) kinetics.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) has emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing green ammonia under ambient conditions. Tungsten (W) is one of the most effective ENRR catalysts. In this reaction, the protonation of intermediates is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). Enhancing the adsorption of intermediates is crucial to increase the protonation of intermediates, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. Herein, we constructed a strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 to elevate the d&#8208;band center of W, thereby strengthening the adsorption of intermediates. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach led to a significantly improved ENRR performance. Specifically, WS2&#8208;WO3 exhibited a high NH3 yield of 62.38&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a promoted faraday efficiency (FE) of 24.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations showed that the strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 upshifted the d&#8208;band center of W towards the Fermi level, leading to enhanced adsorption of &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;NH intermediates on the catalyst surface. This resulted in a significantly promoted reaction rate of the RDS. Overall, our study offers new insights into the relationship between interfacial electric field and d&#8208;band center and provides a promising strategy to enhance the intermediates adsorption during the ENRR process.

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel architecture with FeP nanodots fully embedded in nitrogen doped carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) . Such a structure allows the stress transfer between FeP nanodots and self&#8208;adaptive carbon matrix in sodium storage, which overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), which outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.

         <title>A Concerted Enzymatic and Bioorthogonal Approach for Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Activation of Environment&#8208;Sensitive Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Based Imaging Probes and Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concerted strategy involving enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly to target overexpressed alkaline phosphatases in cancer cells and bioorthogonal reactions for controllable extracellular and intracellular activation of RuII&#8208;based imaging probes and photosensitizers is presented. The emission enhancement, lifetime extension, and (photo)cytotoxicity of the resulting RuII supramolecular assemblies were explored extracellularly and intracellularly.







Abstract
In this article, we report a novel targeting strategy involving the combination of an enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) moiety and a strained cycloalkyne to generate large accumulation of bioorthogonal sites in cancer cells. These bioorthogonal sites can serve as activation triggers in different regions for transition metal&#8208;based probes, which are new ruthenium(II) complexes carrying a tetrazine unit for controllable phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation. Importantly, the environment&#8208;sensitive emission of the complexes can be further enhanced in the hydrophobic regions offered by the large supramolecular assemblies, which is highly advantageous to biological imaging. Additionally, the (photo)cytotoxicity of the large supramolecular assemblies containing the complexes was investigated, and the results illustrate that cellular localization (extracellular and intracellular) imposes a profound impact on the efficiencies of photosensitizers.

     alt="A Concerted Enzymatic and Bioorthogonal Approach for Extra- and Intracellular Activation of Environment-Sensitive Ruthenium(II)-Based Imaging Probes and Photosensitizers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concerted strategy involving enzyme-instructed self-assembly to target overexpressed alkaline phosphatases in cancer cells and bioorthogonal reactions for controllable extracellular and intracellular activation of Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-based imaging probes and photosensitizers is presented. The emission enhancement, lifetime extension, and (photo)cytotoxicity of the resulting Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; supramolecular assemblies were explored extracellularly and intracellularly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we report a novel targeting strategy involving the combination of an enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) moiety and a strained cycloalkyne to generate large accumulation of bioorthogonal sites in cancer cells. These bioorthogonal sites can serve as activation triggers in different regions for transition metal-based probes, which are new ruthenium(II) complexes carrying a tetrazine unit for controllable phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation. Importantly, the environment-sensitive emission of the complexes can be further enhanced in the hydrophobic regions offered by the large supramolecular assemblies, which is highly advantageous to biological imaging. Additionally, the (photo)cytotoxicity of the large supramolecular assemblies containing the complexes was investigated, and the results illustrate that cellular localization (extracellular and intracellular) imposes a profound impact on the efficiencies of photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Bound Formates are Main Reaction Intermediates during CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Cu/ZrO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different types of formates were observed at the surface of a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst during the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. A Cu&#8208;bound formate representing only about 7&#8201;% of formates exhibited a high reactivity and was the only formate that could account for the production of methanol. The two other surface formates were located on the ZrO2 surface and exhibited significantly lower decomposition rates.







Abstract
Cu/ZrO2 is a promising catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Reaction pathways involving formates or hydroxycarbonyls have been proposed. We show here that three different types of formates can be observed under reaction conditions at 220&#8201;&#176;C and 3&#8197;bar, one being located on metallic Cu and two others being bound to ZrO2. The surface concentrations of formates were determined through calibration curves and their reactivity measured during chemical transient experiments. The Cu&#8208;bound formate represented only about 7&#8201;% of surface formates, but exhibited a higher reactivity and was found to be the only formate that could account for all the production of methanol. Copper is thus not there only to activate H2, but also bears other crucial intermediates. This work reemphasizes that fully quantitative IR analyses and transient methods are required to unravel the role of surface species.

         <title>Supramolecularly Engineered Reporters with Superoxide Anion&#8208;Triggered Chemiluminescence for Early Diagnosis and Efficient Amelioration of Acute Kidney Injury</title>

Supramolecularly engineered chemiluminescence reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate, chlorin e6 and superoxide dismutase, are reported. The PCCS reporters were applied for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney injury.







Abstract
We report the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; preparation of kidney injury molecule&#8208;1&#8208;targeting supramolecular chemiluminescence (CL) reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid (PLGA)&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), for early diagnosis and amelioration of acute kidney injury (AKI). In this system, O2&#8901;&#8722;, a biomarker of AKI, triggers the oxidation of CPPO to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanedione and subsequent CL emission via CL resonance energy transfer to Ce6. The L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA stabilizes CPPO and Ce6 via noncovalent interactions, promoting long&#8208;lived CL (half&#8208;lives: &#8776;1000&#8197;s). Transcriptomics analysis shows that PCCS reporters reduce the inflammatory response through glutathione metabolism and inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. The reporters are able to non&#8208;invasively detect AKI at least 12&#8197;h earlier than current assays, and their antioxidant properties allow simultaneous treatment of AKI.

         <title>Unlocking Migratory Insertion in Gold Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in the AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle has been reported. It represents important progress within the field of gold redox couple chemistry and in particular in the migratory insertion topic.







Abstract
Exploration of elementary reactions in organometallic catalysis is an important method with which to discover new reactions. In this article, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in gold catalytic cycle. A wide range of structurally diverse alkynyl iodides are good coupling partners in this iodo&#8208;alkynylation transformation. Both aliphatic and aromatic alkynyl iodides can react with benzynes smoothly to afford highly functionalized 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics in moderate to good yields. Its good functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage application of complex molecules demonstrate its synthetic robustness. Studies of the mechanism reveals the feasibility of oxidative addition and the DFT calculations demonstrate the possible migratory insertion of benzyne into AuIII&#8208;carbon bonds in the AuI/AuIII redox catalytic cycle, representing an important step towards an elementary reaction in gold chemistry research.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of H2O2 and Formate by Co&#8208;Electrolysis of Water and CO2 over Bifunctional Zn/SnO2 Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate was constructed with the bifunctional electrocatalyst Zn/SnO2 nanodots, achieving high selectivities and excellent productivities at large current densities. The role of the Zn dopant was revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and (quasi)&#8208;in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation with cathodic CO2 reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn&#8208;doped SnO2 (Zn/SnO2) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6&#8201;% and 92.2&#8201;% for H2O2 and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60&#8197;h at a current density of &#8776;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/1H NMR and quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H2O2 production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8208;based pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate feedstocks.

         <title>Multistate Aggregation&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Properties of Enantiopure Disulfide&#8208;Mediated Bispyrene Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective double thiol&#8208;ene addition onto a bis enol ether macrocycle provides chiral disulfide bispyrene macrocycles able to exhibit excimer aggregation&#8208;induced emission predominantly. Upon increasing the water content, ECD and CPL monitoring evidence multistate chiroptical properties, rationalized by TDDFT calculations. Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films and AFM studies help decipher the organization of the luminophores at the interface of water.







Abstract
A chiral bispyrene macrocycle designed for exclusive intermolecular excimer fluorescence upon aggregation was synthesized by a double hydrothiolation of a bis&#8208;enol ether macrocycle followed by intramolecular oxidation of free thiols. Unusually high stereoselectivity was achieved for the thiol&#8208;ene additions under templated conditions and Et3B/O2 radical initiation. After enantiomer separation (chiral stationary phase HPLC), aqueous conditions provoked aggregation. Detailed structural evolution was afforded by ECD/CPL monitoring. Three regimes can be observed and characterized by strong modifications in chiroptical patterns under, at, or above a 70&#8201;% H2O&#8201;:&#8201;THF threshold. In luminescence, high glum dissymmetry factors values were obtained, up to 0.022, as well as a double sign inversion of CPL signals during the aggregation, a behavior rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Langmuir layers of enantiopure disulfide macrocycles were formed at the air&#8211;water interface and transferred onto solid substrates to afford Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films, which were then studied by AFM and UV/ECD/fluorescence/CPL.

         <title>Probing Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Covalently Linked [Ge9]&#8208;Cluster Imine Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylated [Ge9] clusters form a novel type of chromophore system. Protonation of a covalently cluster&#8208;bound imine moiety results in an intense color change from red to green. Transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations on the protonated form reveal ultrafast dynamics upon photoexcitation leading to a charge&#8208;transfer between the cluster and the imine moiety, thus giving the proof of principle for a cluster&#8208;imine dyad.







Abstract
C60 donor dyads in which the carbon cage is covalently linked to an electron&#8208;donating unit have been discussed as one possibility for an electron&#8208;transfer system, and it has been shown that spherical [Ge9] cluster anions show a close relation to fullerenes with respect to their electronic structure. However, the optical properties of these clusters and of functionalized cluster derivatives are almost unknown. We now report on the synthesis of the intensely red [Ge9] cluster linked to an extended &#960;&#8208;electron system. [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp]&#8722; (1&#8722;) is formed upon the reaction of [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; with bromo&#8208;diazaborole DAB(II)Dipp&#8208;Br in CH3CN (TMS=trimethylsilyl; DAB(II)=1,3,2&#8208;diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in 1&#8722; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N(H)}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp] (1&#8208;H) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory suggests a charge&#8208;transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of 1&#8208;H in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest&#8208;energy excited state at &#955;=669&#8197;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo&#8208;active cluster compounds.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding can play a significant role in designing complex bioinspired structures. Here, two different types of this interaction were employed to construct single and double helices from planar benzotellurazole amides.







Abstract
As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.

         <title>New Radical Route and Insight for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of Benzimidazoles Integrated with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a conceptually new, highly efficient radical route for the benzimidazole synthesis via radical&#8208;induced cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols and o&#8208;arylenediamines concomitantly with hydrogen (H2) production over Pd modified ultrathin ZnO NSs (Pd/ZnO) under mild conditions.







Abstract
Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower&#8208;cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high&#8208;performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H2) over Pd&#8208;decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). The mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently&#8208;generated C&#8208;centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical&#8208;induced efficient benzimidazole synthesis pairing with H2 evolution by rationally designing semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox systems.

         <title>Chemically Gradient Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Crystal Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF on an in situ grown polymer film. The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network and showed improved proton conductivity compared to its polymeric analog.

Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are ordered supramolecular solid structures, however, nothing much explored as centimetre&#8208;scale self&#8208;standing films. The fabrication of such crystals comprising self&#8208;supported films is challenging due to the limited flexibility and interaction of the crystals, and therefore studies on two&#8208;dimensional macrostructures of HOFs are limited to external supports. Herein, we introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF film on an in situ&#8208;formed covalent organic polymer film (Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF). The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The kinetic&#8208;controlled Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF showed enhanced proton conductivity (8.3&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to its rapid kinetic analogue, Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;COP (2.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which signifies the advantage of bonding&#8208;engineering in the same system.

         <title>Solar Light Driven H2O2 Production and Selective Oxidations Using a Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst Prepared by a Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) prepared via the multicomponent Povarov reaction shows a high and long&#8208;term stable activity for photocatalytic H2O2 production and size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation. The COF can be further used as photocatalyst for a range of important aerobic oxidation reactions including the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes, amines to imines and sulfides to sulfoxides.







Abstract
A chemically stable 2D microporous COF (PMCR&#8208;1) was synthesized via the multicomponent Povarov reaction. PMCR&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable and long&#8208;term stable photocatalytic H2O2 production rate (60&#8197;h) from pure and sea water under visible light. The H2O2 production is markedly enhanced when benzyl alcohol (BA) is added as reductant, which is also due to a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of BA with dangling phenyl moieties in the COF pores introduced by the multicomponent Povarov reaction. Motivated by the concomitant BA oxidation to benzaldehyde during H2O2 formation, the photocatalytic oxidation of various organic substrates such as benzyl amine and methyl sulfide derivatives was investigated. It is shown that the well&#8208;defined micropores of PMCR&#8208;1 enable size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation.

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spiro&#8208;type hole transport material (HTM) was developed by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system (DP). The new HTM features a stabilized HOMO level, a higher glass transition temperature, and improved morphology on the perovskite layer compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. When incorporated into an n&#8208;i&#8208;p device, the DP&#8208;based HTM achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area (0.06&#8197;cm2) devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules (designated area of 27.56&#8197;cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78&#8201;% on a designated area of 27.86&#8197;cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1&#8201;% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2560&#8197;hours and 87&#8201;% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600&#8197;hours.

         <title>The Influence of Regiochemistry on the Performance of Organic Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the influence of sidechain regiochemistry on a series of thiophene&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting polymers, the degree of conformational disorder is found to be a crucial indicator of performance. Maximising non&#8208;covalent planarising interactions and polaronic charge delocalisation during molecular design must consequently be carefully weighed against considerations around conformational restrictions.







Abstract
Thiophenes functionalised in the 3&#8208;position are ubiquitous building blocks for the design and synthesis of organic semiconductors. Their non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature has long been used as a powerful synthetic design tool exemplified by the vastly different properties of regiorandom and regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) owing to the repulsive head&#8208;to&#8208;head interactions between neighbouring side chains in the regiorandom polymer. The renewed interest in highly electron&#8208;rich 3&#8208;alkoxythiophene based polymers for bioelectronic applications opens up new considerations around the regiochemistry of these systems as both the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and head&#8208;to&#8208;head couplings adopt near&#8208;planar conformations due to attractive intramolecular S&#8722;O interactions. To understand how this increased flexibility in the molecular design can be used advantageously, we explore in detail the geometrical and electronic effects that influence the optical, electrochemical, structural, and electrical properties of a series of six polythiophene derivatives with varying regiochemistry and comonomer composition. We show how the interplay between conformational disorder, backbone coplanarity and polaron distribution affects the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction. Ultimately, we use these findings to identify a new conformationally restricted polythiophene derivative for p&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistor applications with performance on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed conductors evidenced by a &#956;C* product of 267&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites Camouflaged with Hybrid Cell Membranes for Accurate Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid cell membranes (HMs) consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membranes and glioma cell membranes were prepared and coated onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles. The obtained HMGINPs inherited good blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier penetration and homologous glioma targeting ability from the two types of source cells, and exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy against early&#8208;stage glioma.







Abstract
Glioma features high fatality rate and short survival time of patients due to its fast growth speed and high invasiveness, hence timely treatment of early&#8208;stage glioma is extremely important. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non&#8208;targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired.

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid cell membranes (HMs) consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membranes and glioma cell membranes were prepared and coated onto drug-loaded nanoparticles. The obtained HMGINPs inherited good blood-brain-barrier penetration and homologous glioma targeting ability from the two types of source cells, and exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy against early-stage glioma.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioma features high fatality rate and short survival time of patients due to its fast growth speed and high invasiveness, hence timely treatment of early-stage glioma is extremely important. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non-targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired. We herein proposed a hybrid cell membrane (HM) camouflage strategy to construct therapeutic nanocomposites, in which HM consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membrane and glioma cell membrane was prepared with a simple membrane fusion pathway. By coating HM onto drug-loaded nanoparticles, the as-obtained biomimetic therapeutic agent (termed HMGINPs) inherited satisfying BBB penetrability and homologous glioma targeting ability simultaneously from the two source cells. HMGINPs exhibited good biocompatibility and superior therapeutic efficacy towards early-stage glioma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulated Ion/Electron&#8208;Conducting Interphase Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ions Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) with ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase was prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. This novel structure suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition due to the fast ionic/electronic transport and high Young's modulus, thus achieving long&#8208;cycling aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metallic Zinc (Zn) is considered as a remarkably promising anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric capacity and low redox potential. Unfortunately, dendritic growth and severe side reactions destabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, and ultimately reduce the electrochemical performance. Here, an artificial protective layer (APL) with a regulated ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase is constructed on the Zn&#8208;metal anode to provide excellent interfacial stability in high&#8208;rate cycling. The superior ionic and moderate electronic conductivity of the APL derives from the co&#8208;embedding of MXene and Zn(CF3SO3)2 salts into the polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, which enables a synergistic effect of local current density reduction during plating and ion transport acceleration during stripping for Zn anode. Furthermore, the high Young's modulus of the protective layer and dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology during cycling suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (2.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and passivation. As a result, in symmetrical cell tests, the modified battery presents a stable life of over 2000 cycles at ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research presents a new insight into the formation and regulation of stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for the Zn&#8208;metal anode.

         <title>Rashba Band Splitting and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Induced by Halogen Bonds in Hybrid Layered Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a new series of 2D perovskites featuring thickness&#8208;dependent hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions. The strength of non&#8208;covalent interaction has a direct impact on the structure symmetry and optoelectronic properties. Stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetry, whereas weaker halogen bonds give rise to non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures, Rashba splitting, suppressed radiative recombination, and bulk photovoltaic effect.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an essential role in directing the self&#8208;assembly of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic crystals. In hybrid halide perovskites, hydrogen bonding has been the paramount non&#8208;covalent interaction. Here, we show another non&#8208;covalent interaction, namely, the halogen bond interaction, that directs a symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly in a new series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites (ICH2CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n is the layer thickness, n=1&#8211;4). Structural analysis shows that the halogen bond strength varies with the layer thickness. For the odd number (n=1, 3) layered perovskites, stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetric structures, whereas for the n=2 layered perovskites, weaker halogen bonds result in non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Transient reflection spectroscopy shows a suppressed radiative recombination rate (k2&#8776;0) and prolonged spin lifetime for n=2 structure, suggesting an enhanced Rashba band splitting effect. The structural asymmetry is further confirmed with a reversible bulk photovoltaic effect. Our work provides a new design strategy to enable hybrid perovskites with emerging properties and functionalities associated with structural asymmetry.

         <title>A General Autofluorescence Method to Characterize Polymerization Progress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potentially general autofluorescence method that does not rely on traditional fluorogenic functional groups enables real&#8208;time/in&#8208;line spectroscopic monitoring of polymerization progress. Fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) is developed and demonstrated. Changes in (auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching correlate linearly with polymer degree of cure.







Abstract
An autofluorescence technique to characterize polymerization progress in real time/in line was developed, which functioned in the absence of typical fluorogenic groups on the monomer or polymer. The monomer dicyclopentadiene and polymer polydicyclopentadiene are hydrocarbons that lack traditional functional groups for fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the autofluorescence of formulations containing this monomer and polymer during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was harnessed for reaction monitoring. The methods fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and here&#8208;developed fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) characterized polymerization progress in these native systems&#8212;without requiring exogenous fluorophore. (Auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery changes during polymerization correlated linearly to degree of cure, providing a quantitative link with reaction progress. These changing signals also provided relative rates of background polymerization, enabling comparison of 10 different catalyst&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;stabilized formulations. Multiple&#8208;well analysis demonstrated suitability for future high&#8208;throughput evaluation of formulations for thermosets. The central concept of the combined autofluorescence and FLRAP/FRAP method may be extendable to monitoring other polymerization reactions previously overlooked for lack of an obvious fluorescence handle.

         <title>Bioinspired Single&#8208;Atom Sites Enable Efficient Oxygen Activation for Switching Anodic/Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring axial coordination of Fe sites for charge redistribution realizes efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to generate specific active intermediates. Highly active hydroxyl radicals produced by axial N&#8208;involved systems enable direct cathodic electrochemiluminescence, while C&#8208;decorated catalysts preferentially form superoxide anion radicals and only present anodic luminescence.







Abstract
Exploring advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerators with superior oxygen reduction activity that generate rich reactive oxygen species (ROS) has attracted great attention in boosting luminol&#8208;O2 electrochemiluminescence (ECL). However, tuning accelerators for efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to switch anodic/cathodic ECL is very challenging. Herein, we report that enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with axial N/C coordination structures (FeN5, FeN4&#169; SACs) can generate specific ROS for cathodic/anodic ECL conversion. Mechanistic studies reveal that FeN5 sites prefer to produce highly active hydroxyl radicals and afford direct cathodic luminescence by promoting the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds through N&#8208;induced electron redistribution. In contrast, FeN4&#169; sites tend to produce superoxide radicals, resulting in inefficient anodic ECL. Benefiting from the enhanced cathodic ECL, FeN5 SAC&#8208;based immunosensor was constructed for the sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers.

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroatomic&#8208; and heptagons&#8208; doped multiple helicenes were successfully synthesized and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. They exhibit distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circular dichroism (CD) signals, with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99&#8201;% and 65&#8201;% with narrow FWHM of 24&#8197;nm and 22&#8197;nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.

         <title>Design of the Ionic Organic Nonlinear Optical Material NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4] with Ultrawide Band Gap and Moderate Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent organic flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit, through reasonable nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;favourable layered design, a deep&#8208;ultraviolet ionic organic nonlinear optical crystal, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], with an ultrawide band gap and moderate birefringence was successfully obtained.







Abstract
Ionic organic crystals containing organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated units has become one of the hot spots as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although this type of ionic organic NLO crystals commonly have remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, they also suffer from overlarge birefringences and relatively small band gaps that be hardly beyond 6.2&#8197;eV. Herein, a flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit was theoretically revealed, showing great potential for designing NLO crystals with balanced optical properties. Accordingly, through the reasonable NLO&#8208;favourable layered design, a new ionic organic material, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], was successfully obtained. As expected, it achieves not only a large SHG effect (4&#215;KDP), but also a suitable birefringence (0.06@546&#8197;nm) and an ultrawide band gap (&gt;6.5&#8197;eV). This study provides a new flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO&#8208;active unit, contributing to design more ionic organic NLO materials with excellent balanced optical properties.

         <title>Imaging the Footprint of Nanoscale Electrochemical Reactions for Assessing Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a new optical microscopy technique to measure the synergistic effect of metal hydroxide coatings on the hydrogen evolution reaction at the individual particle level in neutral media. The technique involves using hydroxide halo formation as a footprint of the reaction, and can provide real&#8208;time operando quantification of catalytic activity.







Abstract
This work proposes a novel method for measuring the intrinsic activity of single metal&#8208;based nanoparticles towards water reduction in neutral media at industrially relevant current densities. Instead of using gas nanobubbles as proxy, the method uses optical microscopy to track the local footprint of the reaction through the precipitation of metal hydroxide, which is associated to the local pH increase during electrocatalysis. The results show the electrocatalytic activities of different types of metal nanoparticles and bifunctionnal core&#8208;shell nanostructures made of Ni and Pt, and demonstrate the importance of metal hydroxide nano&#8208;shells in enhancing electrocatalysis. This method should be generalizable to any electrocatalytic reaction involving pH changes such as nitrate or CO2 reduction.

         <title>Photochemically&#8208;Driven CO2 Release Using a Metastable&#8208;State Photoacid for Energy Efficient Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat is achieved for simulated and amino acid&#8208;based direct air capture systems by regulating solution pHs via a photoinduced proton transfer of a reversible metastable&#8208;state photoacid, leading to energetically sustainable and economically feasible climate change mitigation solutions using solar energy.







Abstract
One of the grand challenges underlying current direct air capture (DAC) technologies relates to the intensive energy cost for sorbent regeneration and CO2 release, making the massive scale (GtCO2/year) deployment required to have a positive impact on climate change economically unfeasible. This challenge underscores the critical need to develop new DAC processes with substantially reduced regeneration energies. Here, we report a photochemically&#8208;driven approach for CO2 release by exploiting the unique properties of an indazole metastable&#8208;state photoacid (mPAH). Our measurements on simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems revealed the potential of mPAH to be used for CO2 release cycles by regulating pH changes and associated isomers driven by light. Upon irradiating with moderate intensity light, a &#8776;55&#8201;% and &#8776;68&#8201;% to &#8776;78&#8201;% conversion of total inorganic carbon to CO2 was found for the simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of on&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat, thereby providing an energy efficient pathway for the regeneration of DAC sorbents.

Here we report a synthetic procedure for the efficient ex situ generation of thiazyl trifluoride gas (N&#8801;SF3) as a new Sulfur(VI)&#8208;Fluoride Exchange hub. In typical SuFEx fashion, this triple&#8208;bonded azasulfur(VI) fluoride reagent and its mono&#8208;substituted derivatives react highly effectively with various nucleophiles to deliver a library of unreported thiazynes.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry, an all&#8208;encompassing term for substitution events that replace fluoride at an electrophilic sulfur(VI), enables the rapid and flexible assembly of linkages around a SVI core. Although a myriad of nucleophiles and applications works very well with the SuFEx concept, the electrophile design has remained largely SO2&#8208;based. Here, we introduce S&#8801;N&#8208;based fluorosulfur(VI) reagents to the realm of SuFEx chemistry. Thiazyl trifluoride (NSF3) gas is shown to serve as an excellent parent compound and SuFEx hub to efficiently synthesize mono&#8208; and disubstituted fluorothiazynes in an ex situ generation workflow. Gaseous NSF3 was evolved from commercial reagents in a nearly quantitative fashion at ambient conditions. Moreover, the mono&#8208;substituted thiazynes could be extended further as SuFEx handles and be engaged in the synthesis of unsymmetrically disubstituted thiazynes. These results provide valuable insights into the versatility of these understudied sulfur functionalities paving the way for future applications.

         <title>Stochastic Simulation of Controlled Radical Polymerization Forming Dendritic Hyperbranched Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The results suggest that the observed dispersities (&#272;=1.5&#8211;2) originated from the distribution of branch numbers and that the branch structures are well controlled. Furthermore, the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one.







Abstract
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The simulation program successfully reproduced the change of dispersities (&#272;s) during the polymerization process. Furthermore, the simulation suggested that the observed &#272;s (=1.5&#8211;2) are due to the distribution of the number of branches instead of undesired side reactions, and that the branch structures are well controlled. In addition, the analysis of the polymer structure reveals that the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one. The simulation also suggested the slight dependence of branch density on molecular weight, which was experimentally confirmed by synthesizing HBPs with an evolmer having phenyl group.

         <title>Evidence of a Uranium&#8208;Paddlewheel Node in a Catecholate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through solvothermal combination of uranyl and a redox&#8208;active linker, we reduced the U&#8722;O bonds and subsequently formed a metal&#8208;organic framework built from a uranium paddlewheel node. This paddlewheel node, where two uranium atoms are connected by four hexahydroxytriphenylene species and capped with water moieties, is unprecedented.







Abstract
The interactions between uranium and non&#8208;innocent organic species are an essential component of fundamental uranium redox chemistry. However, they have seldom been explored in the context of multidimensional, porous materials. Uranium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a new angle to study these interactions, as these self&#8208;assembled species stabilize uranium species through immobilization by organic linkers within a crystalline framework, while potentially providing a method for adjusting metal oxidation state through coordination of non&#8208;innocent linkers. We report the synthesis of the MOF NU&#8208;1700, assembled from U4+&#8208;paddlewheel nodes and catecholate&#8208;based linkers. We propose this highly unusual structure, which contains two U4+ ions in a paddlewheel built from four linkers&#8212;a first among uranium materials&#8212;as a result of extensive characterization via powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), sorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in addition to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Phase Transition Engineering of Host Perovskite toward Optimal Exsolution&#8208;facilitated Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have implemented a set of strategies to precisely control the phase evolution of host perovskite without compromising exsolution. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an example, we demonstrated how regulating phase structure can enhance the activity and stability of exsolved perovskites, emphasizing the importance of phase evolution control in catalytic chemistry occurring on perovskites with exsolution.







Abstract
The in situ exsolution technique of nanoparticles has brought new opportunities for the utilization of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts in solid oxide cells. However, the lack of control over the structural evolution of host perovskites during the promotion of exsolution has restricted the architectural exploitation of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskites. In this study, we strategically broke the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between promoted exsolution and suppressed phase transition via B&#8208;site supplement, thus broadening the scope of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskite materials. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an illustrative case study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity and stability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles (P&#8208;eNs) can be selectively enhanced by regulating the explicit phase of host perovskites, accentuating the critical role of the architectures of perovskite scaffold in catalytic reactions occurring on P&#8208;eNs. The concept demonstrated could potentially pave the way for designing the advanced exsolution&#8208;facilitated P&#8208;eNs materials and unveiling a wide range of catalytic chemistry taking place on P&#8208;eNs.

         <title>Sequential Multistep Excited&#8208;State Structural Transformations in N,N&#8242;&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituent engineering of dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine&#8208;based fluorophores was demonstrated to access broadband triple fluorescent emissions from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm. Mechanistic studies revealed that the steric effect modulates the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface, enabling the molecule to undergo multistep transformation along the sequence of bent, planar, and twisted structures.







Abstract
We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt;500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, the introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.

Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PES). Compared to the steep S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PES of parental &lt;b&gt;DPAC&lt;/b&gt;, the introduction of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; wider and flatter, so the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited-state structural relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Monosubstituted Sulfondiimines by Metal&#8208;free Iminations of Sulfilimium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an operationally simple and safe method for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines starting from stable sulfiliminium salts. This metal&#8208;free procedure employs a combination of iodine(III) reagents with iodine and 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), providing particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted sulfondiimines in up to 85&#8201;% yield. Mechanistically, electrophilic nitrene cations are suggested as the reactive intermediates.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are marginalized entities among nitrogen&#8208;containing organosulfur compounds, despite offering promising properties for applications in various fields including medicinal and agrochemical. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid synthetic procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines that overcomes current limitations in their synthetic accessibility. Particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl substrates, which are commonly difficult to convert by existing methods, react well with a combination of iodine, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), and iminoiodinanes (PhINR) in acetonitrile (MeCN) to furnish the corresponding sulfondiimines in yields up to 85&#8201;% (25&#8197;examples). Valuable &#8220;free&#8221; NH&#8208;N&#8242;H&#8208;sulfondiimines can then be accessed by N&#8208;deprotection under mild reaction conditions. Several experimental observations suggest a mechanistic pathway diverging from the common radical&#8208;based iodine/iminoiodinane mechanism. Based on the experimental results in combination with data obtained by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis we propose a direct amination from PhINNs and a reaction path via a cationic iodonitrene.

         <title>A Radio&#8208;Pharmaceutical Fluorescent Probe for Synergistic Cancer Radiotherapy and Ratiometric Imaging of Tumor Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical imaging agent and radiosensitized pharmaceutical containing diselenide and metronidazole was developed to realize the radiosensitizing effect and report the ROS levels through ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This molecule exhibited synergetic radiosensitization and could monitor the radiotherapy response for both hypoxic tumors and orthotopic glioma.







Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective and widely applied cancer treatment strategy in clinic. However, it usually suffers from radioresistance of tumor cells and severs side effects of excessive radiation dose. Therefore, it is highly significant to improve radiotherapeutic performance and monitor real&#8208;time tumor response, achieving precise and safe RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive radio&#8208;pharmaceutical molecule containing chemical radiosensitizers of diselenide and nitroimidazole (BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN) is reported. BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN exhibits enhanced radiotherapeutic effect via a multifaceted mechanisms and self&#8208;monitoring ROS levels in tumors during RT. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the diselenide produces high levels of ROS, leading to enhanced DNA damage of cancer cell. Afterwards, the nitroimidazole in the molecule inhibits the damaged DNA repair, offering a synergetic radiosensitization effect of cancer. Moreover, the probe shows low and high NIR&#8208;II fluorescence ratios in the absence and presence of ROS, which is suitable for precise and quantitative monitoring of ROS during sensitized RT. The integrated system is successfully applied for radiosensitization and the early prediction of in vitro and in vivo RT efficacy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biscyclopropanes Using Alkynes as Dicarbene Equivalents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed double cyclopropanation of CF2H&#8208;substituted enyne with alkenes is reported. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed with excellent stereoselectivity in one step. The method was extended to the cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation. In these processes, the functional alkyne is used as a dicarbene equivalent and 3 new rings are formed.







Abstract
Chiral biscyclopropanes are an important skeleton in many bioactive molecules. However, there are few routes to synthesize these molecules with high stereoselectivity due to the nature of multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report the first example of Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of bicyclopropanes with alkynes as dicarbene equivalents. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed in excellent stereoselectivity. This protocol features high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol was also extended to the cascaded cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation with excellent stereoselectivities. In these processes, both sp&#8208;carbons of alkyne were converted into stereogenic sp3&#8208;carbons. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cooperative weak hydrogen bonds between the substrates and the dirhodium catalyst may play key roles in this reaction.

         <title>Tetrazole Linkages as Photoactivated Fuels for Light&#8208;Regulated Photothermal/Photocatalytic Propulsion of Versatile Polymer Nanoplatforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated versatile polymer nanoplatforms with asymmetric geometry enable on&#8208;demand integration of various functionalities via tetrazole linkages. In response to UV or visible light, tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels simultaneously perform photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the polymer nanoplatforms for powering the multimode synergistic propulsion, thus showing potential in bio&#8208;applications.







Abstract
Colloidal motors with multimode propulsion have attracted considerable attention because of enhanced transportability. It is a great challenge to fabricate colloidal motors powered by a single engine for multimode synergistic propulsion. Herein, we report on Janus versatile polymer nanoplatforms integrating various functionalities via tetrazole linkages for light&#8208;regulated multimode synergistic propulsion in the liquid. The presence of tetrazole linkages in the polymers endows the nanoparticles with various photoresponsive capabilities. A sole energy source (ultraviolet or visible light) simultaneously activates photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the tetrazole&#8208;containing polymer phase at one side of asymmetric nanoparticles for converting light energy into photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion independent of the surrounding chemical medium. The photoactivated locomotion using tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels highly corresponds to light wavelengths, light powers and tetrazole contents. The tetrazole linkages capable of incorporating various functionalities to the polymer nanoparticles allow on&#8208;demand customizing of the colloidal motors, showing great potential in bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Efficient Selective Oxidation of Aromatic Alkanes by Double Cobalt Active Sites over Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;rich Mesoporous Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4) was synthesized by a simple ligand&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly method. Benefitting from abundant oxygen vacancies and the mesoporous structure of mCo3O4, a unique catalytic path was presented with direct oxidation of aromatic alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones.







Abstract
The development of efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of hydrocarbon to functional compounds remains a challenge. Herein, mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4&#8208;350) showed excellent catalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes, especially for oxidation of ethylbenzene with a conversion of 42&#8201;% and selectivity of 90&#8201;% for acetophenone at 120&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, mCo3O4 presented a unique catalytic path of direct oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones. Density functional theory calculations revealed that oxygen vacancies in mCo3O4 activate around Co atoms, causing electronic state change from Co3+(Oh)&#8594;Co2+(Oh). Co2+(Oh) has great attraction to ethylbenzene, and weak interaction with O2, which provide insufficient O2 for gradual oxidation of phenylethanol to acetophenone. Combined with high energy barrier for forming phenylethanol, the direct oxidation path from ethylbenzene to acetophenone is kinetically favorable on mCo3O4, sharply contrasted to non&#8208;selective oxidation of ethylbenzene on commercial Co3O4.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyethyleneimines from the Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the synthesis of polyethyleneimines is reported based on manganese catalysed coupling of ethylene glycol and ethylene diamine. This avoids the use of the highly toxic feedstock, namely aziridine, that is currently used for the production of this polymer.







Abstract
Polyethyleneimines find many applications in products such as detergents, adhesives, cosmetics, and for processes such as tissue culture, gene therapy, and CO2 capture. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for the production of the branched polyethyleneimines involves aziridine feedstock which is a highly toxic, volatile and mutagenic chemical and raises significant concern to human health and environment. We report here a novel method for the synthesis of branched polyethyleneimine derivative from ethylene glycol and ethylenediamine which are much safer, environmentally benign, commercially available and potentially renewable feedstock. The polymerisation reaction is catalysed by a complex of an earth&#8208;abundant metal, manganese and liberates H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Our mechanistic studies using a combination of DFT computation and experiment suggest that the reaction proceeds by the formation and subsequent hydrogenation of imine intermediates.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroalkenylation and Hydroalkynylation of Alkenes Enabled by a Transient Directing Group: Catalyst Generality through Rigidification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of tert&#8208;leucine as a chiral transient directing group enables the enantioselective reductive&#8208;Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl benzaldehydes under palladium catalysis. The dual catalytic reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and alkynes represents a powerful strategy for rapid generation of molecular complexity. Herein, we report a transient directing group (TDG) strategy to facilitate site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkynylation of alkenylaldehyes using alkenyl and alkynyl bromides, respectively, allowing for construction of a stereocenter at the &#948;&#8208;position with respect to the aldehyde. Computational studies reveal the dual beneficial roles of rigid TDGs, such as L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine, in promoting TDG binding and inducing high levels of enantioselectivity in alkene insertion with a variety of migrating groups.

An active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;mediated strategy paves a way for enhancing ethanol production from CO2&#160;electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202302096), Xu Xiang, Jing He and co&#8208;workers unveil that the increased *H coverage on a layered precursor&#8208;derived Cu&#8208;based catalyst favors hydrogenation of *HCCOH to *HCCHOH and prioritizes the ethanol pathway, enabling highly efficient and durable production of ethanol. Such a strategy could be of potential use in *H&#8208;involved reduction reactions.

Organic electrode materials could break the dependency of lithium&#8208;ion batteries on minerals that are scarce and mined in conflict zones. In their Communication (e202300892), Yanliang Liang, Judy&#8197;I. Wu, Ognjen&#8197;&#352;. Miljani&#263;, Yan Yao et&#8197;al. report a naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil macrocycle as a promising organic electrode candidate. Its eight redox&#8208;active groups bring about a high specific capacity of 279 mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, while the low solubility&#8212;a consequence of the shape&#8208;persistent structure&#8212;results in stable cycling performance.

         <title>Back Cover: Superprotonic Conductivity of MOFs Confining Zwitterionic Sulfamic Acid as Proton Source and Conducting Medium (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 29/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity, utilizing MOFs embedded with a moderately acidic guest&#8212;zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA)&#8212;was demonstrated by Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302376). HSA not only acted as a proton source, but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. The MOFs, which had been filled with high quantities of HSA using a sustained concentration gradient method, exhibited impressive superprotonic conductivity, in the order of 10&#8722;1 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, they maintained their stability for a period of 7 days.

         <title>A Crowning Achievement: The First Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy was designed and implemented by Wu and co&#8208;workers, enabling the first solution&#8208;phase synthesis of circumcoronene derivatives, and providing the first direct evidence to the structure of the debated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.







Abstract
Circumcoronene is a highly symmetric polybenzenoid hydrocarbon that has fascinated organic chemists and materials scientists for decades. However, until recently, it had only been studied theoretically, because its synthesis in solution remained challenging. In a recent report, Wu and co&#8208;workers described the first successful solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of crystalline circumcoronene derivatives, validating the long&#8208;predicted Clar structure. Their synthetic approach enables preparation of new polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons with multiple K&#8208;regions, which are difficult to obtain, and expands our understanding of the chemistry of these systems.

         <title>Carbon Deposit Analysis in Catalyst Deactivation, Regeneration, and Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article discusses the role of carbon species deposited from various feedstock molecules or formed over time during a catalytic process, including ways to mitigate the effects of these carbon species by catalyst design, regeneration or rejuvenation. This is done for various industrially relevant systems, including the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. New tools for the direct observation of the 3D&#8208;distribution of carbon species within the catalyst pore network are also described.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon conversion catalysts suffer from deactivation by deposition or formation of carbon deposits. Carbon deposit formation is thermodynamically favored above 350&#8201;&#176;C, even in some hydrogen&#8208;rich environments. We discuss four basic mechanisms: a carbenium&#8208;ion based mechanism taking place on acid sites of zeolites or bifunctional catalysts, a metal&#8208;induced formation of soft coke (i.e., oligomers of small olefins) on bifunctional catalysts, a radical&#8208;mediated mechanism in higher&#8208;temperature processes, and fast&#8208;growing carbon filament formation. Catalysts deactivate because carbon deposits block pores at different length scales, or directly block active sites. Some deactivated catalysts can be re&#8208;used, others can be regenerated or have to be discarded. Catalyst and process design can mitigate the effects of deactivation. New analytical tools allow for the direct observation (in some cases even under in situ or operando conditions) of the 3D&#8208;distribution of coke&#8208;type species as a function of catalyst structure and lifetime.

         <title>Traffic Lights for Catalysis: Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular and Extended Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as flowers blooming in response to the sun attract bees to continue their natural life cycle, molecules which respond to external stimuli can be used to control catalytic cycles. Development of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular and extended catalytic platforms is a pathway for precise tuning of reaction yield, rate, or enantioselectivity that could pave the way for the next era of sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Sulfonium Salts as Acceptors in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes is a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radicals. Sulfonium salt acceptors promise to dramatically expand the range of radicals that can be generated and exploited using EDA chemistry; the use of readily installed &#8220;sulfonium tags&#8221; relaxes the electronic constraints typically imposed on the parent substrate by an EDA complexation approach.







Abstract
The photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexation, however, imposes electronic constraints on the donor and acceptor components and this can limit the range of radicals that can be generated using the approach. New EDA complexation strategies exploiting sulfonium salts allow radicals to be generated from native functionality. For example, aryl sulfonium salts, formed by the activation of arenes, can serve as the acceptor components in EDA complexes due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature. This &#8220;sulfonium tag&#8221; approach relaxes the electronic constraints on the parent substrate and dramatically expands the range of radicals that can be generated using EDA complexation. In this review, these new applications of sulfonium salts will be introduced and the areas of chemical space rendered accessible through this innovation will be highlighted.

         <title>Photocatalysis as an Effective Tool for Upcycling Polymers into Value&#8208;Added Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis has recently evolved to a powerful tool to convert plastics directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. Researchers developed distinct light&#8208;driven depolymerization strategies for various polymers, ranging from hydroxylated (bio)polymers to real&#8208;life polystyrene. These methods operate under mild conditions, show high efficiency, and thus constitute a promising alternative to traditional recycling methods.







Abstract
Shaping a sustainable future is closely tied to the development of advanced plastic recycling technologies. As global recycling rates remain low, the lion's share of post&#8208;consumer plastics is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. This unbalanced plastic waste management not only poses severe environmental risks, but also entails an irrevocable loss of chemical resources that are embedded in synthetic polymers. To give plastic waste a new life, a series of photocatalytic methods has recently been reported that convert polymers directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. These approaches operate at ambient temperature, show high reactivity/selectivity, and provide alternative reaction pathways as compared to thermal depolymerizations. This Minireview highlights the scientific breakthroughs in upcycling polymers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis under environmentally benign conditions.

         <title>Controlled Genetic Encoding of Unnatural Amino Acids in a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the application of the genetic code expansion technique to achieve the site&#8208;specific modification of the sensing region of a nanopore. The rationally designed conformation of unnatural amino acid (UAA) residues provides a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of peptides and pore. The chemical environment of the sensing region facilitates the direct discrimination of the mixtures of peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids.







Abstract
Conventional protein engineering methods for modifying protein nanopores are typically limited to 20 natural amino acids, which restrict the diversity of the nanopores in structure and function. To enrich the chemical environment inside the nanopore, we employed the genetic code expansion (GCE) technique to site&#8208;specifically incorporate the unnatural amino acid (UAA) into the sensing region of aerolysin nanopores. This approach leveraged the efficient pyrrolysine&#8208;based aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;tRNA pair for a high yield of pore&#8208;forming protein. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single&#8208;molecule sensing experiments demonstrated that the conformation of UAA residues provided a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of target molecules and the pore. This rationally designed chemical environment enabled the direct discrimination of multiple peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Our work provides a new framework for endowing nanopores with unique sensing properties that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.

Naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil octaketone is an excellent cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. It reversibly accepts eight electrons per molecule, has a specific capacity of 279&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and shows stable cycling performance with &#8776;65&#8201;% retention after 135&#8197;cycles. Its shape&#8208;persistent, symmetric structure rigidifies during an eight&#8208;electron reduction, ensuring that this macrocycle remains insoluble in various redox states.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials could revolutionize batteries because of their high energy densities, the use of Earth&#8208;abundant elements, and structural diversity which allows fine&#8208;tuning of electrochemical properties. However, small organic molecules and intermediates formed during their redox cycling in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have high solubility in organic electrolytes, leading to rapid decay of cycling performance. We report the use of three cyclotetrabenzil octaketone macrocycles as cathode materials for LIBs. The rigid and insoluble naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil reversibly accepts eight electrons in a two&#8208;step process with a specific capacity of 279&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance with &#8776;65&#8201;% capacity retention after 135&#8197;cycles. DFT calculations indicate that its reduction increases both ring strain and ring rigidity, as demonstrated by computed high distortion energies, repulsive regions in NCI plots, and close [C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C] contacts between the naphthalenes. This work highlights the importance of shape&#8208;persistency and ring strain in the design of redox&#8208;active macrocycles that maintain very low solubility in various redox states.

         <title>Resolidified Chalcogen Precursors for High&#8208;Quality 2D Semiconductor Growth</title>

Chalcogen powder is pre&#8208;melted and resolidified to give a stable chalcogen precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of transition metal dichalcogenides. The obtained monolayer tungsten disulfide is uniform and shows high optical and structural quality.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre&#8208;melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6&#177;1.9&#8197;meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9&#177;3)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2 and (10&#177;4)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.

         <title>Insights into Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on SnS2: Main Product Switch from Hydrogen to Formate by Pulsed Potential Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing S&#8208;vacancies into SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of CO2RR but leads to exclusive H2 evolution under static potential electrolysis. Pulsed potential electrolysis results in in situ generation of partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x in the catalyst, which leads to a switch of the main product from hydrogen to formate during the CO2RR with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to H2.







Abstract
Tin disulfide (SnS2) is a promising candidate for electrosynthesis of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate while the low activity and selectivity remain a great challenge. Herein, we report the potentiostatic and pulsed potential CO2RR performance of SnS2 nanosheets (NSs) with tunable S&#8208;vacancy and exposure of Sn&#8208;atoms or S&#8208;atoms prepared controllably by calcination of SnS2 at different temperatures under the H2/Ar atmosphere. The catalytic activity of S&#8208;vacancy SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) is improved 1.8&#8197;times, but it exhibits an exclusive hydrogen evolution with about 100&#8201;% FE under all potentials investigated in the static conditions. The theoretical calculations reveal that the adsorption of *H on the Vs&#8208;SnS2 surface is energetically more favorable than the carbonaceous intermediates, resulting in active site coverage that hinders the carbon intermediates from being adsorbed. Fortunately, the main product can be switched from hydrogen to formate by applying pulsed potential electrolysis benefiting from in situ formed partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to hydrogen. This work highlights not only the Vs&#8208;SnS2 NSs lead to exclusively H2 formation, but also provides insights into the systematic design of highly selective CO2 reduction catalysts reconstructed by pulsed potential electrolysis.

         <title>A Chemoenzymatic Approach To Produce a Cyclic Analogue of the Analgesic Drug MVIIA (Ziconotide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic method has been developed to prepare backbone cyclic analogues of the &#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA. The most potent cyclic analogue, cM&#8208;7, shows highly improved stability and maintains the activity of the native peptide.







Abstract
Ziconotide (&#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA) is an approved analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the need for intrathecal administration and adverse effects have limited its widespread application. Backbone cyclization is one way to improve the pharmaceutical properties of conopeptides, but so far chemical synthesis alone has been unable to produce correctly folded and backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP)&#8208;mediated cyclization was used to generate backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA for the first time. Cyclization using six&#8208; to nine&#8208;residue linkers did not perturb the overall structure of MVIIA, and the cyclic analogues of MVIIA showed inhibition of voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) and substantially improved stability in human serum and stimulated intestinal fluid. Our study reveals that AEP transpeptidases are capable of cyclizing structurally complex peptides that chemical synthesis cannot achieve and paves the way for further improving the therapeutic value of conotoxins.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziconotide (&#969;-conotoxin MVIIA) is an approved analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the need for intrathecal administration and adverse effects have limited its widespread application. Backbone cyclization is one way to improve the pharmaceutical properties of conopeptides, but so far chemical synthesis alone has been unable to produce correctly folded and backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP)-mediated cyclization was used to generate backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA for the first time. Cyclization using six- to nine-residue linkers did not perturb the overall structure of MVIIA, and the cyclic analogues of MVIIA showed inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2) and substantially improved stability in human serum and stimulated intestinal fluid. Our study reveals that AEP transpeptidases are capable of cyclizing structurally complex peptides that chemical synthesis cannot achieve and paves the way for further improving the therapeutic value of conotoxins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated iontronic nanotool was developed for the study of single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation. With the nanotool, an N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;modified deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) was used for profiling a representative m6&#8197;A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO), which also released a DNA sequence that could be programmed as an antisense strand against intracellular FTO&#8208;mRNA.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell studies; however, solutions to epigenetic questions remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within a nanopipette for profiling a representative m6A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Cytotrienin A: Late&#8208;Stage Installation of C11 Side Chain onto the Macrolactam Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of cytotrienin A, an ansamycin antibiotic with apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity, is described. The strategic use of the redox properties of hydroquinone and the traceless Staudinger reaction enabled the late&#8208;stage installation of the C11 side chain, which plays a critical role in its biological activity, onto the macrolactam and opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of ansamycin antibiotics.







Abstract
Cytotrienin A, an ansamycin&#8208;class antibiotic, exhibits potent apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity and has attracted much attention as a lead compound for anticancer drugs. Herein, we report a new asymmetric synthetic route to cytotrienin A, employing an unexplored approach involving the late&#8208;stage installation of a C11 side chain onto the macrolactam core. In this strategy, we utilized the redox properties of hydroquinone and installed a side chain on the sterically hindered C11 hydroxy group by the traceless Staudinger reaction. This study also demonstrated that the boron&#8208;Wittig/iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling sequence was effective for the concise and selective construction of the (E,E,E)&#8208;conjugated triene moiety. The developed route opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of the side chains of these ansamycin antibiotics and the preparation of other synthetic analogs and chemical probes for further biological studies.

         <title>Non&#8208;canonical Biosynthesis of the Brexane&#8208;Type Bishomosesquiterpene Chlororaphen through Two Consecutive Methylation Steps in Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 and Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the biosynthetic pathway of the first natural brexane&#8208;type compound, chlororaphen, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is methylated and cyclized by a non&#8208;canonical FPP methyltransferase (FPP&#8208;MT), furnishing &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP). Methylation by the &#947;&#8208;PSPP&#8208;MT yields &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP), which is converted into the bishomosesquiterpene chlororaphen by the chlororaphen synthase (ChloS).







Abstract
A non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic pathway furnishing the first natural brexane&#8208;type bishomosesquiterpene (chlororaphen, C17H28) was elucidated in the &#947;&#8208;proteobacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6. A combination of genome mining, pathway cloning, in vitro enzyme assays, and NMR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;step pathway initiated by C10 methylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP, C15) along with cyclization and ring contraction to furnish monocyclic &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP, C16). Subsequent C&#8208;methylation of &#947;&#8208;PSPP by a second C&#8208;methyltransferase furnishes the monocyclic &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP, C17), serving as the substrate for the terpene synthase. The same biosynthetic pathway was characterized in the &#946;&#8208;proteobacterium Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4, demonstrating that non&#8208;canonical homosesquiterpene biosynthesis is more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously anticipated.

         <title>Radical Coupling Initiated by Organophosphine Addition to Ynoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining established two electron nucleophilic catalysis of organophosphines with photoredox organocatalysis has allowed the discovery of a mechanistically unusual Giese coupling reaction. In addition to addressing a limitation in traditional photoredox coupling with electron&#8208;poor alkynes these studies demonstrate the viability of reaction designs that merge traditional nucleophilic phosphines organocatalysis and photoredox events.







Abstract
Dual nucleophilic phosphine photoredox catalysis is yet to be developed due to facile oxidation of the phosphine organocatalyst to the phosphoranyl radical cation. Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.

Inspired by biological mucus, here, we report multi gram&#8208;scale synthesis of dendronized polysulfates as mucin&#8208;inspired virus&#8208;binding polymer (MIPs). Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis reveals their single chain fiber morphology. These biocompatible synthesized fibers inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and inhibitory activities depend on the length of the fibers.







Abstract
Mucins are the key component of the defensive mucus barrier. They are extended fibers of very high molecular weight with diverse biological functions depending strongly on their specific structural parameters. Here, we present a mucin&#8208;inspired nanostructure, produced via a synthetic methodology to prepare methacrylate&#8208;based dendronized polysulfates (MIP&#8208;1) on a multi gram&#8208;scale with high molecular weight (MW=450&#8197;kDa) and thiol end&#8208;functionalized mucin&#8208;inspired polymer (MIP) via RAFT polymerization. Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis of MIP&#8208;1 confirmed a mucin&#8208;mimetic wormlike single&#8208;chain fiber structure (length=144&#177;59&#8197;nm) in aqueous solution. This biocompatible fiber showed promising activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its mutant strain, with a remarkable low half maximal (IC50) inhibitory concentration (IC50=10.0&#8197;nM). Additionally, we investigate the impact of fiber length on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 inhibition by testing other functional polymers (MIPs) of varying fiber lengths.

         <title>Disc&#8208;Like Silver Nanocluster Ag93 Built with Bicapped Hexagonal Prismatic Ag15 and Ino Decahedral Ag13 Units</title>

The largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4) is prepared. It is a disc&#8208;shaped structure, its Ag69 kernel consists of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 wrapped by six Ino decahedral Ag13 units through edge&#8208;sharing. The central silver atom has an unprecedented high coordination number of 14. This is the first time that Ino decahedra act as building blocks to assemble a supercluster.







Abstract
The reduction of alkynyl&#8208;silver and phosphine&#8208;silver precursors with a weak reducing reagent Ph2SiH2 led to the formation of a novel silver nanocluster [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4), which is the largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters. This disc&#8208;shaped cluster has a Ag69 kernel consisting of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 unit wrapped by six Ino decahedra through edge&#8208;sharing. This is the first time that Ino decahedra are used as a building block to assemble a cluster of clusters. Moreover, the central silver atom has a coordination number of 14, which is the highest in metal nanoclusters. This work provides a diverse metal packing pattern in metal nanoclusters, which is helpful for understanding metal cluster assembling mechanisms.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional LDH Film Templating for Controlled Preparation and Performance Enhancement of Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer facilitates controlled interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride and piperazine, which results in two membranes with good separation performances towards salts and dyes. Due to the low water transport resistance of the LDH layer and the thinner polyamide layer, the composite membrane has a larger flux, which is a breakthrough in the trade&#8208;off between permeance and selectivity.







Abstract
Tailored design of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes that can be used in a variety of applications such as water desalination, resource recovery, and sewage treatment is desirable. Herein, we describe the use of layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer to control the interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP) for the preparation of polyamide (PA) membrane. The dense surface of LDH layer and its unique mass transfer behavior influence the diffusion of PIP, and the supporting role of the LDH layer allows the formation of ultrathin PA membranes. By only changing the concentration of PIP, a series of membranes with controllable thickness from 10 to 50&#8197;nm and tunable crosslinking&#8208;degree can be prepared. The membrane prepared with a higher concentration of PIP shows excellent performance for divalent salt retention with water permeance of 28&#8197;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1, high rejection of 95.1&#8201;% for MgCl2 and 97.1&#8201;% for Na2SO4. While the membrane obtained with a lower concentration of PIP can sieve dye molecules of different sizes with a flux of up to 70&#8201;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the controllable preparation of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes and provides new insights into how the intermediate layer affects the IP reaction and the final separation performance.

         <title>Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized Terthiophene Redox Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although main group redox systems are attractive as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, achieving high cell voltages via extreme redox couples typically compromises their long&#8208;term stabilities. We show that phosphine oxide functionalization can render terthiophenes robust two&#8208;electron acceptors at very low potentials, thus opening fundamentally new parameter space in the search for stable main group redox systems with high cell voltages.







Abstract
Main group systems capable of undergoing controlled redox events at extreme potentials are elusive yet highly desirable for a range of organic electronics applications including use as energy storage media. Herein we describe phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophenes that exhibit two reversible 1e&#8722; reductions at potentials below &#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+ (Fc=ferrocene) while retaining high degrees of stability. A phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophene radical anion was synthesized in which the redox&#8208;responsive nature of the platform was established using combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterization. Straightforward structural modification led to the identification of a derivative that exhibits exceptional stability during bulk 2&#8201;e&#8722; galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling and enabled characterization of a 2&#8201;e&#8722; redox series. A new multi&#8208;electron redox system class is hence disclosed that expands the electrochemical cell potential range achievable with main group electrolytes without compromising stability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Analysis of the S&#8208;Glycosylation Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Lincosamide Antibiotics</title>

         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of ergothioneine, 1, into secondary metabolites. The structure and function analysis of LmbT provided a structural basis for the SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with ergothioneine. These findings will lead to the mechanistic understanding of key enzyme reactions in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine&#8208;containing natural products such as lincomycin&#8197;A.







Abstract
The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT, involved in the biosynthesis of lincomycin&#8197;A, is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic incorporation of rare amino acid L&#8208;ergothioneine (EGT) into secondary metabolites. Here, we show the structure and function analyses of LmbT. Our in vitro analysis of LmbT revealed that the enzyme shows promiscuous substrate specificity toward nitrogenous base moieties in the generation of unnatural nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)&#8208;D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;lincosamides. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of LmbT in its apo form and in complex with substrates indicated that the large conformational changes of the active site occur upon binding of the substrates, and that EGT is strictly recognized by salt&#8208;bridge and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with Arg260 and Trp101, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;The S-glycosyltransferase LmbT is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of ergothioneine, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, into secondary metabolites. The structure and function analysis of LmbT provided a structural basis for the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-like S-glycosylation reaction with ergothioneine. These findings will lead to the mechanistic understanding of key enzyme reactions in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine-containing natural products such as lincomycin&#8197;A.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S-glycosyltransferase LmbT, involved in the biosynthesis of lincomycin&#8197;A, is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic incorporation of rare amino acid L-ergothioneine (EGT) into secondary metabolites. Here, we show the structure and function analyses of LmbT. Our in vitro analysis of LmbT revealed that the enzyme shows promiscuous substrate specificity toward nitrogenous base moieties in the generation of unnatural nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)-D-&#945;-D-lincosamides. Furthermore, the X-ray crystal structures of LmbT in its apo form and in complex with substrates indicated that the large conformational changes of the active site occur upon binding of the substrates, and that EGT is strictly recognized by salt-bridge and cation-&#960; interactions with Arg260 and Trp101, respectively. The structure of LmbT in complex with its substrates, the docking model with the EGT-S-conjugated lincosamide, and the structure-based site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed the structural details of the LmbT-catalyzed S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-like S-glycosylation reaction with EGT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carrier Protein Mediated Formation of the Dihydropyridazinone Ring in Actinopyridazinone Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinopyridazinone biosynthesis represents a unique biochemical transformation of an amino acid. It involves N&#947;&#8208;amination of DABA using alanine as a nitrogen donor. An acetyl hydrazone intermediate undergoes an unprecedented carrier protein mediated heterocyclization to give a dihydropyridazinone. This is a sophisticated biosynthetic strategy in which an acetylation temporarily protects the reactive hydrazone during biosynthesis.







Abstract
Heterocycles with nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bonds are privileged building blocks of synthetic drugs. They are also found in natural products, although the biosynthetic logic behind them is poorly understood. Actinopyridazinones produced by Streptomyces sp. MSD090630SC&#8208;05 possess unique dihydropyridazinone rings that have been studied as core nuclei in several approved synthetic therapeutics. Herein, we performed gene knockouts and in vitro biochemical experiments to elucidate the major steps in actinopyridazinone biosynthesis, including the unprecedented carrier protein mediated machinery for dihydropyridazinone formation.

         <title>Discrimination of the Enantiotopic Faces of Structurally Unbiased Carbenium Ions Employing a Cyclohexadiene&#8208;Based Chiral Hydride Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cyclohexadiene&#8208;based dihydrogen surrogate can distinguish between the enantiotopic faces of benzylic carbenium ions (see Scheme). No covalent interactions are required but instead dispersion controls the facial discrimination as verified by computations.







Abstract
An enantioselective reduction of simple carbenium ions with cyclohexadienes containing a hydridic C&#8722;H bond at an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom is disclosed. The net reaction is a transfer hydrogenation of alkenes (styrenes) only employing chiral cyclohexadienes as dihydrogen surrogates. The trityl cation is used to initiate a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted process, in which a delicate intermolecular capture of a carbenium&#8208;ion intermediate by the aforementioned chiral hydride source is enantioselectivity determining. Exclusively non&#8208;covalent interactions are rendering one of the transition states energetically more favored, giving the reduction products in good enantiomeric ratios. The computed reaction mechanism supports the present findings as well as previous results obtained from studies on other transfer&#8208;hydrogenation methods involving the cyclohexadiene platform.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine 1&#8208;Imines via RuII/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Cyclization</title>

Enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization of sulfondiimines with sulfoxonium ylides using a RuII catalyst and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, thus expanding the accessible chemical space of chiral hexavalent organosulfur scaffolds relevant to biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are diaza&#8208;analogues of sulfones with a chiral sulfur center. Compared to sulfones and sulfoximines, their synthesis and transformations have so far been studied to a lesser extent. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, i.e., cyclic sulfondiimine derivatives from sulfondiimines and sulfoxonium ylides via C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization reactions. The combination of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid is key to achieving high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Sculponin&#8197;U through a Photoinduced Radical Cascade Cyclization</title>

         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a C20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid, was completed. The hexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton was strategically established by a photoinduced electron transfer, generating a cationic radical intermediate from a silyl enolate.







Abstract
We have accomplished the total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a polycyclic C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid featuring a 7,20&#8208;lactone&#8208;hemiketal bridge, through a radical cascade cyclization triggered by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of a silyl enolate to form the cyclohexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton. Other key points in our synthetic strategy encompass a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to construct the middle six&#8208;membered ring of sculponin&#8197;U, and an intramolecular radical cyclization induced by iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer to close the western cyclohexane ring. Successful preparation of the enantiopure silyl enolate as the PET precursor enables the asymmetric total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, opening a new avenue for divergent syntheses of structurally related C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane congeners and pharmaceutical derivatives thereof.

         <title>Profiling Phosphoproteome Landscape in Circulating Extracellular Vesicles from Microliters of Biofluids through Functionally Tunable Paramagnetic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle to phosphoproteins (EVTOP) as a novel strategy achieves one&#8208;pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides starting with microliters of biofluids, enabling ultrasensitive EV phosphoproteome analyses of challenging biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with limited volume.







Abstract
Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease&#8208;relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one&#8208;pot extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation, extraction, and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only a trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with TiIV ions and a membrane&#8208;penetrating peptide, octa&#8208;arginine R8+, which also provides the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on&#8208;bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to TiIV ion&#8208;only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra&#8208;sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500&#8197;unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1200&#8197;phosphopeptides with 100&#8197;&#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

     alt="Profiling Phosphoproteome Landscape in Circulating Extracellular Vesicles from Microliters of Biofluids through Functionally Tunable Paramagnetic Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicle to phosphoproteins (EVTOP) as a novel strategy achieves one-pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides starting with microliters of biofluids, enabling ultrasensitive EV phosphoproteome analyses of challenging biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with limited volume.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease-relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one-pot extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation, extraction, and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only a trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; ions and a membrane-penetrating peptide, octa-arginine R&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which also provides the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on-bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; ion-only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra-sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500&#8197;unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1200&#8197;phosphopeptides with 100&#8197;&#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We explored its clinical application of monitoring the outcome of chemotherapy of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients with a small volume of CSF, presenting a powerful tool for broad clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Free, Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Free and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Saturated Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a powerful complement to existing organic amine catalysis, direct activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of saturated cyclic ketones is realized for the first time in an amine&#8208;free and directing&#8208;group&#8208;free catalytic mode. The carbonyl group binds to a defect site of the quantum dot (QD) surface, selectively weakening the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, instead of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, and exclusively generating an &#945;&#8208;C radical under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This unique activation platform leads to selective activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic ketones under redox&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
The activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones typically requires an amine and a directing group to guide the reaction selectivity in amine&#8208;catalysis carbonyl chemistry. For an &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of ketone, directing groups are also required to control the reaction selectivity. Reported herein is the first &#945;&#8208;alkylation of cyclic ketones in the absence of an amine catalyst and directing group. 1H&#8197;NMR, XPS, EPR studies and DFT calculations indicate that an &#945;&#8208;carbon radical intermediate is formed through direct and selective activation of the inert &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones chelating on the surface of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). Such an interaction is essential for weakening the C&#8722;H bond, as exemplified, using CdSe QDs as the sole photocatalyst to execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of cyclic ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Without an amine catalyst and directing group, the high step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy transformation under redox&#8208;neutral condition opens a new way for &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of ketones in carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Amplified Chirality Transfer to Aromatic Molecules through Non&#8208;specific Inclusion by Amorphous, Hyperbranched Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active, hyperbranched poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives have been shown to include aromatic small molecules in their interior space. These small molecules form liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;like intermolecular arrangements and exhibit clear circular dichroism and efficient circularly polarized luminescence with remarkably amplified anisotropy.







Abstract
Optically active, hyperbranched, poly(fluorene&#8208;2,4,7&#8208;triylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) [poly(fluorenevinylene)] derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the fluorene backbone at various ratios acted as a chirality donor (host polymers) efficiently included naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 9,10&#8208;diphenyanthracene as a chirality acceptor (guest molecules) in their interior space in film as well as in solution, with the guest molecules exhibiting intense circular dichroism through chirality transfer with chirality amplification. The efficiency of the chirality transfer was much higher with higher&#8208;molar&#8208;mass polymers than lower&#8208;molar&#8208;mass ones as well as with hyperbranched polymers compared to the analogous linear ones. The hyperbranched polymers include the small molecules in their complex structure without any specific interactions at various stoichiometries. The included molecules may have ordered intermolecular arrangement that may be somewhat similar to those of liquid crystals. Naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene included in the polymer exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence, where the chirality was remarkably amplified in excited states, and anthracene exhibited especially high anisotropies in the emission on the order of 10&#8722;2.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Area Determination of Anisotropic Polymersomes by Amphiphilic Molecular Probe Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular probe loading method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method relies on the loading of an amphiphilic molecular probe onto the PEG corona of polymersomes as a monolayer. The surface area of anisotropic polymersomes is determined by the loading amount of probes.







Abstract
The surface area of anisotropic polymeric assemblies is a critical parameter concerning their properties. However, it is still a grand challenge for traditional techniques to determine the surface area. Here, a molecular probe loading (MPL) method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method uses an amphiphilic molecular probe, comprising hydrophobic pyrene as the anchor and hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol (EG4) as the float. The surface area of spherical polymersomes determined by dynamic light scattering is quantitatively correlated with the loading amount of probes, allowing the calculation of the average separation distance between the loaded probes. With the separation distance, we successfully determine the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes by measuring the loading amount. We envision that the MPL method will assist in the real&#8208;time surface area characterization, enabling the customization of functions.

         <title>Elucidating the Structures of Intermediate Fragments during Stepwise Dissociation of Monolayer&#8208;Protected Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry, combined with theoretical calculations, is used to resolve the structures of intermediate fragments produced upon dissociation of atomically precise silver clusters in the gas&#8208;phase, which has remained challenging using other methodologies.







Abstract
Fragmentation dynamics of ligated coinage metal clusters reflects their structural and bonding properties. So far methodological challenges limited probing structures of the fragments. Herein, we resolve the geometric structures of the primary fragments of [Ag29L12]3&#8722;, i.e. [Ag24L9]2&#8722;, [Ag19L6]&#8722; and [Ag5L3]&#8722; (L is 1,3&#8208;benzene dithiolate). For this, we used trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry to determine collision cross sections of the fragments and compared them to structures calculated by density functional theory. We also report that following two sequential [Ag5L3]&#8722; elimination steps, further dissociation of [Ag19L6]&#8722; also involves a new channel of Ag2 loss and Ag&#8722;S and C&#8722;S bond cleavages. This reflects a competition between retaining the electronic stability of 8&#8201;e&#8722; superatom cluster cores and increasing steric strain of ligands and staples. These results are also of potential interest for future soft&#8208;landing deposition studies aimed at probing catalytic behavior of Ag clusters on supports.

         <title>Multi&#8208;stage Transformations of a Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Perturbing Crystals to Glass&#8208;Forming Liquids that Re&#8208;Crystallize at High Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
The first MOF glass composed of metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units is vitrified by multi&#8208;stage transformations: The crystalline MOF is amorphized by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration, goes through a glass transition to enter a super&#8208;cooled liquid state, and recrystallizes into the initial structure. These multi&#8208;stage transformations are a rare example of high&#8208;temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Glassy and liquid state metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging type of materials subjected to intense research for their rich physical and chemical properties. In this report, we obtained the first glassy MOF that involves metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units via multi&#8208;stage structural transformations. This MOF is composed of linear [Mn3(COO)6] node and flexible pyridyl&#8208;ethenylbenzoic linker. The crystalline MOF was first perturbed by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration to give an amorphous state, which can go through a glass transition at 505&#8197;K into a super&#8208;cooled liquid. The super&#8208;cooled liquid state is stable through a wide temperature range of 40&#8197;K and has the largest fragility index of 105, giving a broad processing window. Remarkably, the super&#8208;cooled liquid can not only be quenched into glass, but also recrystallize into the initial MOF when heated to a higher temperature above 558&#8197;K. The mechanism of the multi&#8208;stage structural transformations was studied by systematic characterizations of in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, calorimetry, rheological, spectroscopic and pair&#8208;distribution function analysis. These multi&#8208;stage transformations not only represent a rare example of high temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly, but also provide new MOF processing strategy through crystal&#8208;amorphous&#8208;liquid&#8208;crystal transformations.

         <title>Hybrid Improper Ferroelectricity in Columnar (NaY)MnMnTi4O12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In columnar order quadrupole perovskites A2A&#8242;A&#8242;&#8242;B4O12 hybrid improper ferroelectricity emerges through A&#8208;site cation ordering across anti&#8208;displaced structural columns. This novel form of polar order couples to an intrinsic proper ferroelectric instability associated with underbonded magnetic A&#8242; Mn2+ ions, giving rise to a biased, asymmetric switching response under applied electric field that coexists at low temperature with antiferromagnetism.







Abstract
We show that cation ordering on A site columns, oppositely displaced via coupling to B site octahedral tilts, results in a polar phase of the columnar perovskite (NaY)MnMnTi4O12. This scheme is similar to hybrid improper ferroelectricity found in layered perovskites, and can be considered a realisation of hybrid improper ferroelectricity in columnar perovskites. The cation ordering is controlled by annealing temperature and when present it also polarises the local dipoles associated with pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller active Mn2+ ions to establish an additional ferroelectric order out of an otherwise disordered dipolar glass. Below TN&#8776;12&#8197;K, Mn2+ spins order, making the columnar perovskites rare systems in which ordered electric and magnetic dipoles may reside on the same transition metal sublattice.

         <title>Assembling a Heterobimetallic Actinide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by a Reaction&#8208;Induced Preorganization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unique architecture of the largest&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thorium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), a second actinide, uranyl, with dintinct coordination behaviour was successfully assembled into the framework via a novel reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy to yield a rare single crystalline heterobimetallic actinide MOF.







Abstract
Periodically arranging coordination&#8208;distinct actinides into one crystalline architecture is intriguing but of great synthetic challenge. We report a rare example of a heterobimetallic actinide metal&#8211;organic framework (An&#8208;MOF) by a unique reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy. A thorium MOF (SCU&#8208;16) with the largest unit cell among all Th&#8208;MOFs was prepared as the precursor, then the uranyl was precisely embedded into the MOF precursor under oxidation condition. Single crystal of the resulting thorium&#8208;uranium MOF (SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U) shows that a uranyl&#8208;specific site was in situ induced by the formate&#8208;to&#8208;carbonate oxidation reaction. The heterobimetallic SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U exhibits multifunction catalysis properties derived from two distinct actinides. The strategy proposed here offers a new avenue to create mixed&#8208;actinide functional material with unique architecture and versatile functionality.

&#8220;Our group is energized by research topics that merge materials chemistry with supramolecular chemistry. We are actively investigating the development of coordination chemistry for host&#8211;guest complexes and sensing, and investigating photonic materials prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline biopolymers&#8230; In our experience, nearly every good piece of new research involves serendipity.&#8221; Find out more about work in the MacLachlan group at the University of British Columbia.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the MacLachlan group at the University of British Columbia. They recently published an article on the uniform growth of a metal&#8211;organic framework, ZIF&#8208;8, on the surface of individual cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). After the ZIF&#8208;8/CNC fibers had been coated with a microporous organic polymer, the ZIF&#8208;8 was removed to leave a microporous polymer with CNCs encapsulated in a ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle architecture. This material proved to be effective for CO2 fixation. &#8220;Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8 on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers&#8221;, K.
