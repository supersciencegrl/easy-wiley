         <title>Carbon Nanocage Supported Asymmetrically Coordinated Nickle Single&#8208;Atom for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction in Membrane Electrode Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow carbon carrier design of the Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst can facilitate increased active site exposure and improved mass transfer, achieving industrial&#8208;level current density within the membrane electrode assembly. Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C achieved nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across the wide current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Designing efficient catalysts for operating CO2 electroreduction in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) faces significant obstacles. Herein, we propose an asymmetrically coordinated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring axial Br coordination at NiN4Br sites anchoring onto hollow Br/N co&#8208;doped carbon nanocages, achieved through a NaBr&#8208;assisted confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy. The Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO&gt;97&#8201;%) over the current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the MEA device. Furthermore, Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C shows a stable cell voltage of 2.66&#177;0.2&#8197;V while delivering a large current density of 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over an 85&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation, demonstrating its potential for industrial&#8208;scale applications. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the coordination and doping of Br not only enhance the intrinsic activity but also highlight that the unique pore structure improves mass transfer efficiency.

         <title>Localized Oxidative Catalytic Reactions Triggered by Cavitation Bubbles Confinement on Copper Oxide Microstructured Particles.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localised oxidative catalytic reactions triggered by cavitation bubbles confinement on copper oxide microstructured particles.We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates selective and localised acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, minimising the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes towards catalytic oxidative reactions.







Abstract
Efficient energy transfer management in catalytic processes is crucial for overcoming activation energy barriers while minimizing costs and CO2 emissions. We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates the selective and efficient acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, avoiding the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes. Utilizing a chemical thermometric approach, we demonstrate that the local temperature on the surface of our CuO particles during cavitation bubble implosions can create an effective equivalent temperature of about 360&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature effect facilitates the efficient catalysis of oxidative reactions using an organic pollutant probe molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H2O2 and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired N, O Co&#8208;Coordinated Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom catalyst (Mn CD/C) with MnN2O2 atomic sites on the carbon dots exhibited excellent performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide, owing to the electronic regulation effect of coordination environment and adjacent oxygen functional groups.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a pivotal pathway for the distributed production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In nature, enzymes containing manganese (Mn) centers can convert reactive oxygen species into H2O2. However, Mn&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for 2e&#8722; ORR are scarcely reported. Herein, we developed a nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst comprising N, O co&#8208;coordinated Mn sites, utilizing carbon dots as the modulation platform (Mn CD/C). As&#8208;synthesized Mn CD/C exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.786&#8197;V and a maximum H2O2 selectivity of 95.8&#8201;%. Impressively, Mn CD/C continuously produced 0.1&#8197;M H2O2 solution at 200&#8197;mA/cm2 for 50&#8197;h in the flow cell, with negligible loss in activity and H2O2 faradaic efficiency, demonstrating practical application potential. The enhanced activity was attributed to the incorporation of Mn atomic sites into the carbon dots. Theoretical calculations revealed that the N, O co&#8208;coordinated structure, combined with abundant oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon dots, optimized the binding strength of intermediate *OOH at the Mn sites to the apex of the catalytic activity volcano. This work illustrates that carbon dots can serve as a versatile platform for modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts and for the rational design of nature&#8208;inspired catalysts.

         <title>Customizing Bonding Affinity with Multi&#8208;Intermediates via Interfacial Electron Capture to Boost Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative dual&#8208;nitride (WN&#8208;Ni3N) metallic heterostructure, featuring perfect lattice matching and high conductivity, was synthesized to function as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst, fine&#8208;tuning bonding orbital filling with alkaline HER intermediates. The heterointerface charge redistribution accelerates OH&#8722; transfer and H2 release, boosting performance and durability to last 1300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 for water splitting.







Abstract
Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant alkaline HER electrocatalysts is pivotal for sustainable energy, but co&#8208;regulating its intricate multi&#8208;step process, encompassing water dissociation, OH&#8722; desorption, and hydrogen generation, is still a great challenge. Herein, we tackle these obstacles by fabricating a vertically integrated electrode featuring a nanosheet array with prominent dual&#8208;nitride metallic heterostructures characterized by impeccable lattice matching and excellent conductivity, functioning as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst to fine&#8208;tune the bonding affinity with alkaline HER intermediates. Detailed structural characterization and theoretical calculation elucidate that charge redistribution at the heterointerface reduces the O p&#8208;W d and H s&#8208;W d interactions vs. single nitride, thereby enhancing OH&#8722; transfer and H2 release. As anticipated, the resulting WN&#8208;NiN/CFP catalyst demonstrates a gratifying low overpotential of 36.8&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2 for alkaline HER, while concurrently maintaining operational stability for 1300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 for overall water splitting. This work presents an effective approach to meticulously optimize multiple site&#8208;intermediate interactions in alkaline HER, laying the foundation for efficient energy conversion.

         <title>A Knowledge&#8211;Data Dual&#8208;Driven Framework for Predicting the Molecular Properties of Rechargeable Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI) framework, driven by both knowledge and data, predicts electrolyte molecular properties. The KPI collects data, uncovers structure&#8211;property relationships, accurately predicts melting, boiling, and flash points, and identifies promising molecules for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range battery applications. It serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and domain knowledge.







Abstract
Developing rechargeable batteries that operate within a wide temperature range and possess high safety has become necessary with increasing demands. Rapid and accurate assessment of the melting points (MPs), boiling points (BPs), and flash points (FPs) of electrolyte molecules is essential for expediting battery development. Herein, we introduce Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI), a knowledge&#8211;data dual&#8208;driven framework for molecular property prediction of electrolytes. Initially, the KPI collects molecular structures and properties, and then automatically organizes them into structured datasets. Subsequently, interpretable machine learning further explores the structure&#8211;property relationships of molecules from a microscopic perspective. Finally, by embedding the discovered knowledge into property prediction models, the KPI achieved very low mean absolute errors of 10.4, 4.6, and 4.8&#8197;K for MP, BP, and FP predictions, respectively. The KPI reached state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art results in 18 out of 20 datasets. Utilizing molecular neighbor search and high&#8208;throughput screening, 15 and 14 promising molecules, with and without Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number, respectively, were predicted for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range and high&#8208;safety batteries. The KPI not only accurately predicts molecular properties and deepens the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships but also serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and domain knowledge.

         <title>A Covalent Triazine Framework for Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208;functionalization of alkenes is essential for synthesizing natural products, medicinally relevant compounds, and other important molecules. In this context, photocatalysis has emerged as a crucial tool for these reactions. However, existing methods rely on either expensive, or scarce metal photocatalysts, rendering this strategy less feasible for industrial applications. Herein, we disclose the first inexpensive porous heterogeneous material (oxidizing potential: +2.37&#8197;V vs SCE) designed to bridge the existing research gap. The careful selection of monomers to prepare the material enables us to achieve hydrocarboxylation, hydroamination, and hydroazidation across a wide range of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates.







Abstract
Porous materials&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic approach is further extended to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active molecules. Finally, detailed characterizations of the CTF and further mechanistic investigations provide mechanistic insights into these reactions.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Aldimine Umpolung/6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Cascade to Access Tetracyclic Dihydrochromeno Indoles</title>

         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung/6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade leading to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles is presented. The nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates are intercepted with unactivated alkynes for the first time. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8722;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise regioselective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization manner.







Abstract
The umpolung of aldimines using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is less explored compared to the established polarity reversal of aldehydes. Described herein is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung /6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade, which leads to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles. For the first time, the nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates have been intercepted with unactivated alkynes. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8722;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise manner. DFT studies also support the regioselectivity preference for the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway, leading to the exclusive formation of the indole products. Moreover, a comparison of Gibbs free energies provides insight into a thermodynamically preferred 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization over a competing oxa&#8208;Michael pathway. Further, this strategy is applied to the formal synthesis of a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor in a step&#8208;economical method.

         <title>Controlled Helical Organization in Supramolecular Polymers of Pseudo&#8208;Macrocyclic Tetrakisporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrakisporphyrins with amino acid side chains adopt pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic conformations maintained by antiparallel hydrogen bonding. The (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configurations of the stereogenic centers direct the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations direct the left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helical supramolecular pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers, respectively.







Abstract
Tetrakisporphyrin monomers with amino acid side chains at each end form intramolecular antiparallel hydrogen&#8208;bonds to adopt chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic structures that result in right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;conformations. The pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic tetrakisporphyrin monomers self&#8208;assembled to form supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers via head&#8208;to&#8208;head complementary dimerization of the bisporphyrin cleft units in an isodesmic manner. The formation of one&#8208;handed supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The methyl and iso&#8208;propyl groups at the stereogenic center greatly enhanced the induced circular dichroism in the Soret bands of the supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers. The induced CDs were reduced upon the introduction of large iso&#8208;butyl and tert&#8208;butyl groups. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;grown and long supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymer chains with chain lengths in the range of 361 to 13.6&#8197;nm. The right&#8208;handed helical chains were established by the self&#8208;assembly of the right&#8208;handed (P)&#8208;conformation of the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic monomer.

         <title>Electronic Modulation and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Driving Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst Ni&#8722;NSC with undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties implanting in N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics, significantly improving the adsorption, diffusion and reduce reaction energy barrier during sulfur redox reaction. The Li&#8722;S battery employing Ni&#8722;NSC demonstrated high reversible capacity, superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability.







Abstract
Developing efficient and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li&#8722;S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties anchored on N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon (Ni&#8722;NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N&#8722;Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sn2&#8722;, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C), as well as outstanding cycling&#8208;stability for 2400&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C and 3&#8197;C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.05&#8197;C and a retention capacity of 4.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C for Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;A single-atom catalyst Ni&#8722;NSC with undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moieties implanting in N,S-codoped porous carbon enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics, significantly improving the adsorption, diffusion and reduce reaction energy barrier during sulfur redox reaction. The Li&#8722;S battery employing Ni&#8722;NSC demonstrated high reversible capacity, superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient and durable single-atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li&#8722;S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moieties anchored on N,S-codoped porous carbon (Ni&#8722;NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry-breaking charge transfer in Ni single-atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N&#8722;Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;C), as well as outstanding cycling-stability for 2400&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C and 3&#8197;C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.05&#8197;C and a retention capacity of 4.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C for Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides profound insight for rational optimizing microscopic electronic density of active site to promoting SROR in metal-sulfur batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Pd migration is described to achieve enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes. High efficiency with up to 98&#8201;% ee can be achieved in this Pd catalyzed alkenylation and iodo&#8208;migration tandem reaction, which can be applied in the further one&#8208;pot preparation of bifunctionalized chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives.







Abstract
Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98&#8201;% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Defined Synthesis Enabled by Fast and Living Anionic Monoaddition of Vinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;flow living anionic monoaddition of alkyllithium initiators to vinyl monomers such as styrenes and methacrylates has been achieved in a selective manner. This method has been successfully applied to the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multiple vinyl monomers (six&#8208;component addition at maximum).







Abstract
The selective monoaddition of polymerizable vinyl monomers like styrenes and methacrylates in a living manner has been achieved for the flash&#8208;flow preparation of molecules in a defined sequence with high selectivity. We demonstrated the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multifunctional molecules using an initiator, functionalized styrenes, diarylethylenes, various methacrylates, and an electrophilic trapping reagent at the living terminus (six&#8208;component sequential connection at maximum) without any intermediate purification steps. The anionic living terminus of the vinyl monomers in the flow system described herein is active for polymerization, such that the styrene or methacrylate sequence can be expanded to afford highly dispersed oligomers without affecting other single units, which means that the unequivocal sequences were successfully inserted into the internal or terminal positions. The methodology described herein provides an adaptable method for the construction of new molecular spaces based on unimolecular sequence control and pinpoint functionalization.

         <title>From Ions to Crystals: A Comprehensive View of the Non&#8208;Classical Nucleation of Calcium Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate is a mineral of considerable relevance for various industrial and geochemical processes. In the present work, the formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) crystals from aqueous solutions has been elucidated in detail through application of a complementary suite of advanced characterization techniques. The results show how crystalline order emerges from intrinsically disordered precursors and highlights the complexity of mineral nucleation.







Abstract
The early stages of mineralization continue to be in the focus of intensive research due to their inherent importance for natural and engineered environments. While numerous observations have been reported for single steps in the pathways of various crystallizing phases in previous studies, the complexity of the underlying processes and their elusive character have left central questions unanswered in most cases. In the present work, we provide a detailed view on the nucleation of calcium sulfate mineralization&#8212;an abundant mineral with broad use in construction industry&#8212;in aqueous systems at ambient conditions. As experimental basis, a co&#8208;titration procedure with potentiometric, turbidimetric and conductometric detection was developed, allowing solution speciation and the formation of crystallization precursors to be monitored quantitatively as the level of nominal (super)saturation gradually increases. The nature and spatiotemporal evolution of these precursors was further elucidated by time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments, complemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) as a direct imaging technique. The results reveal how ions associate into nanometric primary species, which subsequently aggregate and develop anisotropic order by intrinsic structural reorganization. Our observations challenge the common understanding of fundamental notions such as the nucleation barrier or the meaning of supersaturation, with broad implications for mineralization phenomena in general and the formation of calcium sulfate in geochemical settings and industrial applications in particular.

         <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8208;Reinforced Ion&#8208;Selective Separators for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loading and Lean Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective separators are prepared by spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator. The high electronegativity and strong lithiophilicity of these phenolic compounds ensure superior ion&#8208;selectivity, effectively repelling soluble intermediate anions while facilitating rapid Li ion transport. Thus, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries display superior cycling stability and rate performance under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective separators are promising to inhibit soluble intermediates shuttle in practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, designing and fabricating such high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective separators using cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly, and versatile methods remains a formidable challenge. Here we present ion&#8208;selective separators fabricated via the spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator, aimed at enhancing the stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. The resulting natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective (NPRIS24) separators exhibit rapid Li ion transport and high soluble intermediates inhibition capability with an ultralow shuttle rate of 0.67&#8201;% for Li2S4, 0.19&#8201;% for Li2S6 and 0.10&#8201;% for Li2S8. This superior ion&#8208;selectivity arises from the high electronegativity and strong lithiophilic nature of the phenolic compounds. Consequently, we have achieved high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries that are steadily cyclable under the challenging conditions of an S loading of 5.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;S ratio of 5.1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and a 50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil anode. Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO4 (5.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (9.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cathodes. This work underscores the potential of utilizing natural polyphenols for the design of advanced ion&#8208;selective separators in energy storage systems.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Transfer Protein CERT Using Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are many assays for monitoring enzymatic reactions. But how can the intracellular transport of lipids be analyzed efficiently? Here, an assay for the ceramide transfer protein CERT using nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) is presented. A combinatorial synthesis of analogs of a known inhibitor was used for validation and identified inhibitors with superior potency.







Abstract
A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red&#8208;labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell&#8208;based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility of the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA&#8208;12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid&#8208;phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA&#8208;12 in a subsequent dose&#8208;response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation by Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals via Concerted Electron&#8208;Fluoride Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer (cEF&#8722;T) mechanism is revealed for C(sp3)&#8722;F activation by Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBBRs) with the aid of DFT calculations. Orbital interaction analyses have been conducted for rational design of LBBRs that could selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes, which enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom from fluorocarbons and the generation of an alkyl radical, broadening the scope of XAT reactions.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond activation through a radical pathway in the presence of multiple C&#8722;H bonds remains a formidable challenge, owing to the extraordinarily strong bond strength of the C&#8722;F bond. By the aid of density functional theory calculations, we disclose an innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer mechanism, harnessing the unique reactivity of Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals to selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes. This enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom and subsequent generation of an alkyl radical, thus expanding the boundaries of halogen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Application of Hard and Soft Acid&#8208;base Theory to Construct Heterometallic Materials with Metal&#8208;oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic materials are favored for their diverse structures and enhanced functionality compared to monometallic counterparts. However, their development is often impeded by complex metal coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview showcases the application of Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory as a powerful tool to streamline the design and synthesis of heterometallic clusters and cluster&#8208;based frameworks. Additionally, it briefly explores the synergistic effects that these clusters impart on the properties of heterometallic materials, offering valuable insights for researchers seeking to harness their full potential.







Abstract
Heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials offer the potential to incorporate multiple functionalities, leveraging the aggregation effects of clusters and translating this heterogeneity and complexity into unexpected properties that are more than just the sum of their components. However, the rational construction of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials remains challenging due to the complexity of metal cation coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview provides insights into a general synthetic strategy based on Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory, summarizing its advantages in the designed synthesis of discrete heterometallic clusters (intracluster assembly) and infinite heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials (intercluster assembly). Furthermore, it emphasizes the potential to exploit the intrinsic properties of mixed components to achieve breakthroughs across a broad range of applications. The insights from this review are expected to drive the progress of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials in a controllable and predictable manner.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Stereogenic and Axially Chiral BODIPYs via Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Hetero) Arylation with Diazonaphthoquinones and Diazoindenines</title>

         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction between boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) and a variety of naphthodiazoquinones and diazoindenines via C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation pathways selectively leads to 2&#8208;(hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The synthetic value of the procedures is showcased by BODIPY&#8208;derived functional molecule construction and scaffold diversification. Bioapplications of tailored BODIPYs indicate their promising properties in multidisciplinary research.







Abstract
The molecular engineering of boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) has garnered widespread attention due to their structural diversity enabling tailored physicochemical properties for optimal applications. However, catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse boron&#8208;stereogenic BODIPYs through intermolecular desymmetrization and BODIPYs with atroposelectivity remains elusive. Here, we showcase rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific C&#8722;H (hetero)arylations of prochiral BODIPYs and polysubstituted BODIPYs with diazonaphthoquinonesand diazoindenines, providing efficient pathways for the rapid assembly of versatile (hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs through long&#8208;range desymmetrization and axial rotational restriction modes. The synthetic application of the procedures has been emphasized by the efficient synthesis of BODIPY derivatives with various functions. Photophysical properties, bioimaging, and lipid droplet&#8208;specific targeting capability of tailored BODIPYs are also demonstrated, indicating their promising applications in biomedical research, medicinal chemistry, and material science.

         <title>A Double&#8208;walled Noncovalent Carbon Nanotube by Columnar Packing of Nanotube Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB, which represents the shortest fragment of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes, has been synthesized. While the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotube structure.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through host&#8211;guest complexation of nanotube fragments and tube&#8208;forming crystal engineering. As the smallest fragment of double&#8208;walled CNTs, a host&#8211;guest complex of perfluorocycloparaphenylene (PFCPP) and carbon nanobelt (CNB) was synthesized by mixing them in solvents. The immediate complexation of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex with a remarkably high association constant (Ka) of 2&#215;105&#8197;L/mol was observed. Time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR and thermogravimetry measurements revealed that the stability of (6,6)CNB was significantly improved by encapsulation. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the robust belt&#8208;in&#8208;ring structure of this complex. As indicated by the short distance between PF[12]CPP and (6,6)CNB (2.8&#8197;&#197;), intermolecular orbital interactions exist between the belt and the ring, which were further supported by theoretical calculation and phosphorescence quenching experiments. While the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent CNT structure.

         <title>Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co&#8208;Substitution in Red&#8208;Emitting Phosphor Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ for Advanced Spectroscopic Applications Including Laser Displays with Ultra&#8208;High Luminescence Saturation Threshold</title>

         <dc:description>
This work successfully introduced [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution into the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ lattice. The co&#8208;substitution was verified to enhance the lattice rigidity so as to notably raise the external quantum efficiency. Under blue laser excitation, the phosphor has an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2. Under high pressure, the phosphor has an optimal pressure sensitivity of 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa.







Abstract
In order to obtain novel and more efficient red light&#8208;emitting materials, a series of Sr2[Mg1&#8722;xLixAl5&#8722;xSixN7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN&#8208;xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and successfully synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co&#8208;substitution of [Mg&#8722;Al]5+ by [Li&#8722;Si]5+ on structural and luminescence properties is investigated in detail. A series of powder XRD data and Rietveld refinement indicate that [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution can successfully enter the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN) lattice. With the entry of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ into the lattice, the substitution of Al3+ by Si4+ leads to the weakening of the nephelauxetic effect of the 5d level of Eu2+, which shifts the emission peak from 657&#8197;nm to 647&#8197;nm and reduces the excitation in the green region, i.e., lowers the absorption of green light. When the amount of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution is x=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency (EQE), reflecting the luminescence intensity, is elevated by 49.6&#8201;%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN&#8208;0.1LS can achieve an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2, which is remarkably superior to other existing red phosphors, a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high&#8208;power laser display light sources. Cathodoluminescence (CL) characterization and measurements attest to the favorable CL properties of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS. By measuring the pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650&#8197;nm to 702&#8197;nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.

         <title>Increasing the Donor Strength of Alkenylphosphines by Twisting the C=C Double Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin phosphines with a sulfonyl substituent in the backbone (sNHOP) is reported, in which the olefin moiety is twisted to break the &#960;&#8208;interaction. The resulting zwitterionic structure leads to an increased donor strength of the phosphines and thus in enhanced catalytic activities in gold(I) catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phosphines play a crucial role in transition metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysis. While alkyl groups have traditionally been employed to increase the phosphine donor strength, recent studies have shown that zwitterionic functional groups such as phosphorus ylides can result in a further enhancement. Herein we report the concept of twisting a C=C double bond to introduce a zwitterionic substituent by the synthesis and application of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin phosphines with a sulfonyl substituent (sNHOP). This sulfonyl group enables the twisting of the olefin moiety due to steric and electronic stabilization of the carbanionic center. The resulting zwitterionic structure leads to a significant increase of the donor strength of the sNHOP ligands compared to conventional NHOP systems with a planar N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin moiety. The potential of this new ligand platform for catalysis is demonstrated by its application in the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cyclo&#8208;isomerization of alkynes. Here, the ligands outperform the original NHOP ligands suggesting favorable properties for future catalysis applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pt Loaded on MOF&#8208;Derived Porous TiO2 with Maxim&#8208;Ized Pt Atom Utilization for Selective Hydrogenation of Halonitro&#8208;benzene</title>

         <dc:description>
The precise location control of single atoms relative to supports remains a great challenge in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, through a simple &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; process, the preferential dispersion of single&#8208;atom Pt species outside TiO2 is realzied by decoupling the themolysis of a typical Ti&#8208;based MOF and thermal atomization of PtNPs. The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600, with 100&#8201;% Pt accessibility, exhibits excellent activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB) to p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN).







Abstract
The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single&#8208;atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti&#8208;MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;TiO2@C&#8208;800) at 800&#8201;&#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal&#8208;driven atomization of PtNPs at 600&#8201;&#176;C in air produce single&#8208;atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 exhibits superior p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN) selectivity (99&#8201;%) to PtNPs/TiO2&#8208;400 (45&#8201;%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2&#8208;600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 achieves 100&#8201;% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p&#8208;CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p&#8208;CNB and p&#8208;CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>The Trifluorooxygenate Anion [OF3]&#8722;: Spectroscopic Evidence for a Binary, Hypervalent Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic evidence is presented for the binary, hypervalent [OF3]&#8722;, formed in the reaction of OF2 with laser ablated MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs) under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the bonding in [OF3]&#8722; is similar to that in [F3]&#8722;.







Abstract
Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second&#8208;row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long&#8208;sought binary, hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF3]&#8722;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs). VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level predict a C2v&#8208;symmetric T&#8208;shape structure with one short and two long O&#8722;F bond lengths in [OF3]&#8722;. This is confirmed experimentally by FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotopic labeling. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of one 2c&#8211;2e and one 3c&#8211;4e bond each.

&lt;p&gt;Spectroscopic evidence is presented for the binary, hypervalent [OF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, formed in the reaction of OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with laser ablated MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs) under matrix-isolation conditions. Quantum-chemical calculations show that the bonding in [OF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is similar to that in [F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second-row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long-sought binary, hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs). VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level predict a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric T-shape structure with one short and two long O&#8722;F bond lengths in [OF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is confirmed experimentally by FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotopic labeling. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of one 2c&#8211;2e and one 3c&#8211;4e bond each. Natural resonance theory indicates the importance of the stability of [OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for the stability of [OF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Although free [OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was not detected, the species MOF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Na&#8722;Cs) could be observed in the same experiments, which are best described as contact ion pairs of M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Interfacial Lattice Matching by Selective Epitaxial Growth of CuS Crystals on Bi2WO6 Nanosheets for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction into Solar Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coupling effect of p&#8208;n CS&#8208;BWO heterojunction induced the formation of a robust interface electric field, leading to the efficient charge separation for preferential CO2 photoreduction into CO.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an important technology for value&#8208;added solar fuel production, however, it is generally limited by interfacial charge transport. To address this limitation, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) p&#8208;n heterojunction CuS&#8208;Bi2WO6 (CS&#8208;BWO) with highly connected and matched interfacial lattices was designed in this work via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal tandem synthesis strategy. The integration of CuS with BWO created a robust interface electric field and provided fast charge transfer channels due to the work function difference, as well as highly connected and matched interfacial lattices. The p&#8208;n heterojunction combination promoted the electron transfer from the Cu to Bi sites, leading to the coordination of Bi sites with high electronic density and low oxidation state. The Bi sites in the BWO nanosheets facilitated the adsorption and activation of CO2, and the generation of high&#8208;coverage key intermediate b&#8208;CO32&#8722;, while CuS (CS) acted as a broad light&#8208;harvesting material to provide abundant photoinduced electrons that were injected into the conduction band of BWO for CO2 photoreduction reaction. Remarkably, the p&#8208;n heterojunction CS&#8208;BWO exhibited average CO and CH4 yields of 33.9 and 16.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of CS, BWO, and physical mixture CS&#8208;BWO samples. This work provided an innovative design strategy for developing high&#8208;activity heterojunction photocatalyst for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added solar fuels.

         <title>The Electrode/Electrolyte Interface Study during the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Results from rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy suggest that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R), even in acidic electrolytes. Water molecules, rather than protons, serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. The actual reactant for CO2R is solvated CO2, also known as CO2(aq).







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 Reduction (CO2R) in acidic electrolytes has gained significant attention owing to higher carbon efficiency and stability than in alkaline counterparts. However, the proton source and the role of alkali cations for CO2R are still under debate. By using rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we find that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for CO2R even in acidic electrolytes. We also confirm that water molecules, rather than protons serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Additionally, the solvated CO2, or CO2(aq), is the actual reactant for CO2R. This study provides a deeper understanding of the electrode/electrolyte interface during CO2R in acidic electrolytes and sheds light on further performance improvement of this system.

         <title>Nanoparticle Transport in Proximal Tubules with Rhabdomyolysis&#8208;Induced Necrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibited enhanced kidney accumulation in a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury mouse model. By distinguishing the injury stages of necrotic proximal tubules (PTs) through histopathological characteristics, we found that the enhanced kidney accumulation was due to selective retention of the AuNPs in the extracellular lumen of late&#8208;stage necrotic PTs as a result of lumen obstruction by cell debris.







Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are being explored for their potential to deliver therapeutic agents for kidney disease treatment. A fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles accumulate in diseased kidneys at the cellular level is essential to enhance their effectiveness and minimize side effects on adjacent healthy tissues. Herein, we report that the accumulation of glutathione&#8208;coated, near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoparticles (GS&#8208;AuNPs) correlates strongly with the necrotic stages of injured proximal tubular cells. Using a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model, we observed that GS&#8208;AuNPs were significantly accumulated in the extracellular lumen of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) at advanced necrotic stage, where cellular debris and released intracellular contents impeded their clearance. In contrast, during early necrosis, GS&#8208;AuNPs were still cleared through the unobstructed lumen. Additionally, intracellular uptake of GS&#8208;AuNPs was significantly reduced across all necrotic stages. These findings underscore the need for new strategies to design nanoparticles that can effectively target and be taken up by the diseased tubular cells before extensive necrosis occurs; so that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery for kidney disease treatment can be achieved with desired efficacy and precision.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate as an Ionic Molecular Lock for Ultrastrong Fluorescence of Single Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we modified organic molecules with calcium carbonate oligomers (CCO, (CaCO3)n) in individual molecular states, functionalizing organic molecules with inorganic ionic segments as molecular locks. Due to the rigidity of ionic compound and characteristic of ionic bond, it realized the ultrastrong fluorescence of organic molecules in single molecular state without the change of maximum emission wavelength both in solution and solid.







Abstract
Locking molecular conformation are widely applied in molecular engineering for improved performance. However, locking via organic functional groups often changes the original molecular properties. Following the rigidity and stability of ionic interaction in ionic compounds, we suggested the use of a molecular&#8208;scale ionic compound, calcium carbonate oligomer, as a robust molecular segment to functionalize organic molecules. The rigid structure of the ionic molecular segments locked the organic molecules, which could remarkably limit the intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions. This ensured a stable and ultrastrong fluorescence of the single organic molecule while preserving its original maximum emission wavelength. The locking strategy was general and extendable to multiple organic molecules. Additionally, the ultrastrong single&#8208;molecular fluorescence can be maintained in inorganic solids with even higher quantum yields and almost unchanged maximum emission wavelength. The highest quantum yield of the investigated molecules reached 99.9&#8201;%, superior to all reported organic&#8208;inorganic fluorescent composite under air conditions. This work demonstrates a general strategy to restrict intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions by using ionic oligomers as molecular locks, providing an alternative method for realizing ultraemissive molecules. This further demonstrates a fascinating example of molecular engineering in the presence of inorganic ionic molecules.

         <title>A Piezocatalysis Strategy to Enable Efficient Redox in Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel piezocatalysis mechanism in solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S batteries using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as the piezoelectric catalyst. The piezopotential generated by interfacial stress accumulation efficiently drives redox reactions, enhancing battery kinetics and capacity. This piezocatalytic strategy achieved a remarkable discharge capacity of 670.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Li&#8722;Se batteries and 1463&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Li&#8722;S batteries, providing a promising approach for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis is considered to be a favorable catalytic technology by utilizing external mechanical stimulation to promote the specific redox reactions. The application of piezocatalysis in batteries is promising but faces formidable challenges. Herein, the operation principles of piezocatalysis were successfully demonstrated by constructing solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S battery models with interfacial stress accumulation. Lead zirconate titanate with an ultra&#8208;high piezoelectric coefficient was applied as the piezoelectric catalyst. The uniformity of the dipole orientation in materials was essential for achieving piezocatalysis in batteries. The accumulated high&#8208;stress converts to piezopotential for catalyzing most reaction processes in batteries, while the rapid stress change prevents the internal charge reorganization, ensuring continuous efficient catalysis. The internal stress change alters the internal polarisation strength, driving excess screening charge to participate in the electrochemical reaction. Under piezocatalysis, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se batteries exhibited a initial discharge capacity of 670.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (99.4&#8201;% of the theoretical value) at 0.1&#8197;C, and Li&#8722;S batteries showed a capacity of 1463&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C, which was still maintained up to 1084&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an elevated rate of 0.5&#8197;C. This piezocatalysis strategy provides a strong theoretical basis and design specification for enhancing Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S battery reaction kinetics.

We have precisely prepared hierarchical structures using poly(di&#8208;n&#8208;hexylfluorene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(3&#8208;tetraethylene glycol thiophene) diblock copolymer and polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock copolymer. In seed growth process, by adjusting the structure of the copolymers and solvent polarity, A&#8722;B&#8208;A triblock, multiarm branched micelles, and raft micelles were successfully formed.







Abstract
The precise preparation of hierarchical micelles is a fundamental challenge in modern materials science and chemistry. Herein, poly(di&#8208;n&#8208;hexylfluorene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(3&#8208;tetraethylene glycol thiophene) (poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n)) diblock copolymers and polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock copolymers were synthesized using a one&#8208;pot process via the sequential addition of corresponding monomers using a Ni(II) complex as a single catalyst for living/controlled polymerization. The crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic conjugated poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n) led to the formation of nanofibers with controlled lengths and narrow dispersity. The block copolymers exhibited white, yellow, and red emissions in different self&#8208;assembly states. By using uniform poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n) nanofibers as seeds, introducing the polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock polymer as a unimer in the seed growth process, and adjusting the structure of the poly(phenyl isocyanide) block and the polarity of self&#8208;assembly solvent, A&#8722;B&#8722;A triblock micelles, multiarm branched micelles, and raft micelles were prepared.

         <title>Programmable C&#8722;N Bond Formation through Radical&#8208;Mediated Chemistry in Plasma&#8208;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross coupling. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross&#8208;coupling reactions without the use of external light source, heat, precious metal complex, or trapping agents. A plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion platform is utilized for introduction of hydrazine reagent that undergoes homolytic cleavage forming radical intermediate species. The non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge that causes the cleavage originates from a chemically etched silica capillary. The coupling of the radical intermediates gives various products. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry. The platform is applied herein with a variety of hydrazine substrates, enabling i) self&#8208;coupling to form secondary amines with identical N&#8208;substitutions, ii) cross&#8208;coupling to afford secondary amine with different N&#8208;substituents, iii) cross&#8208;coupling followed by in&#8197;situ dehydrogenation to give the corresponding aryl&#8208;aldimines with two unique N&#8208;substitutions, and iv) cascade heterocyclic carbazole derivatives formation. These unique reactions were made possible in the charged microdroplet environment through our ability to program conditions such as reagent concentration (i.&#8201;e., flow rate), microdroplet reactivity (i.&#8201;e., presence or absence of plasma), and reaction timescale (i.&#8201;e., operational mode of the source). The selected program is implemented in a co&#8208;axial spray format, which is found to be advantageous over the conventional one&#8208;pot single emitter electrospray&#8208;based microdroplet reactions.

         <title>Engineering Single Ni Sites on 3D Cage&#8208;like Cucurbit[n]uril Ligands for Efficient and Selective CO2 Photocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) is designed with a 3D Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) cage&#8208;like ligand to accommodate atomically dispersed nickel centers for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. It achieves a CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% selectivity under visible light irradiation. The homogeneous nature of this co&#8208;catalyst enables efficient charge transfer from photosensitizer to the Ni2+ active site, reducing nearby CO2 molecules enriched by the unique CB[7] cage.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 selective reduction with high conversion is a challenging task yet holds immense promise for both CO2 neutralization and green fuel production. Enhancing CO2 adsorption at the catalytic centre can trigger a highly efficient CO2 capture&#8208;to&#8208;conversion process. Herein, we introduce cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), a new family of molecular ligands, as a key component in the creation of a 3D cage&#8208;like metal (nickel, Ni)&#8208;complex molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) for photocatalysis. It exhibits an unprecedented CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 97.9&#8201;% under visible light irradiation. To verify the origin of the carbon source in the products, a straightforward isotopic tracing method is designed based on tandem reactions. The catalytic process commences with photoelectron transfer from Ru(bpy)32+ to the Ni2+ site, resulting in the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+. The locally enriched CO2 molecules in the cage ligand CB[7] undergo selective reduction by the Ni+ nearby to form CO product. This work exemplifies the inspiring potential of ligand structure engineering in advancing the development of efficient unanchored molecular co&#8208;catalysts.

         <title>Improving the Cellular Internalization of Zr(IV) Nanocages by Tuning Hydrophilicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating the ligand of a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cage with a Ru(II) complex was found to not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Additionally, butyl modifications on the cyclopentadienyl anion rings of the Zr&#8722;O clusters fine&#8208;tuned the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the nanocages, thereby achieving outstanding live&#8208;cell imaging capabilities.







Abstract
Nanoscale molecular materials have emerged as a new class of compounds at the nanometer scale with well&#8208;defined chemical structures, remarkable uniformity and high reproducibility. Among these materials, zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional stability and applications in catalysis, recognition and separation and so on. However, their poor water solubility impedes their biomedical applications. In this study, decorating the ligand with Ru(II) complexes can not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Notably, butyl&#8208;modification of the cyclopentadiene rings can significantly enhance the cell uptake (100&#8197;folds) of nanocages via actin&#8208; and dynamin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The unique advantages and easy modifiability of these nanocages make them highly promising candidates for diverse biological applications.

2D supramolecular polymorphism emerges in a cyanine system from a complex self&#8208;assembly landscape. Designed by Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. (e202415774), the cyanine dye with two rod&#8208;like side groups initially forms nanoparticle&#8208;like aggregates, that transform into 2D H&#8208;type and J&#8208;type aggregates through thermal transitions.

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a high&#8208;entropy strategy for high&#8208;voltage stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. With a typical high&#8208;entropy chloride solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6, we show that the high&#8208;entropy strategy not only enhances the ionic conductivity but also realizes unprecedented high&#8208;voltage stability for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with a long cycling life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250&#8197;cycles with 81.4&#8201;% capacity retention when charged to 4.8&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000&#8197;cycles if charged to 4.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li). Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.

         <title>Enhanced UV Light Responsivity in &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskites Realized by Pressure&#8208;Induced Ultrafast Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study shows a remarkable transition in PL from STEs to FEs and significant enhancement in exciton mobility of 93.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, reaching levels comparable to those in 3D perovskites. Additionally, the evaluation of FE diffusion coefficients under different pressures revealed anisotropic exciton diffusion within the inorganic plane, with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. This value is the highest reported so far in these &#8208;oriented 2D perovskites, due to a decrease in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Characterized by its notably high FE diffusion coefficient, it exhibits an excellent UV light sensitivity at ~2.8&#8197;GPa, highlighting their potential applications in creating high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites exhibit superior optoelectronic properties, offering significant potential in photovoltaic, light&#8208;emitting, and photodetection applications. Nevertheless, their enlarged interlayer spacing restricts longitudinal carrier transport, thereby limiting its potential applications. While &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites provide a prospective solution with their compact interlayer spacing, their inherent structure, characterized by octahedra tilting, indirectly hinders carrier transport due to the generation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) caused by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. Here, we adeptly regulate the photoluminescence (PL) from STEs to free excitons (FEs) emission within the 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented (API)PbBr4 single crystal through structure optimization under pressure treatment. Besides, we observed anisotropic FE transport with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. The exciton mobility reaches a peak of 93.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 2.7&#8197;GPa, a value comparable to those of their three&#8208;dimensional (3D) counterparts, which is attributed to a reduction in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Additionally, this ultrafast exciton transport significantly enhances UV light responsivity, exhibiting an increase of approximately 5000 times at 2.7&#8197;GPa in comparison to ambient conditions. These findings highlight the prospective application of 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices through intrinsic structural modulation.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Copper(I)&#8208;Iodide Cluster Scintillators for Efficient X&#8208;ray Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes a machine learning&#8208;guided approach with fused features to discover superior copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators, achieving a determination coefficient of 0.88. Copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, discovered through this method exhibits radioluminescence that is 56 times higher than PbWO4. It enables detection limits of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 in X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating significant potential for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable band gaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X&#8208;ray radiography. While copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning&#8208;guided discovery of copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X&#8208;ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high&#8208;performance Cu(I)&#8208;I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;Butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO4, and enables a detection limit for X&#8208;rays of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.

&lt;p&gt;This study utilizes a machine learning-guided approach with fused features to discover superior copper(I)-iodide cluster scintillators, achieving a determination coefficient of 0.88. Copper iodide-(1-butyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, discovered through this method exhibits radioluminescence that is 56 times higher than PbWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It enables detection limits of 19.6&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in X-ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and demonstrating significant potential for dynamic X-ray imaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable band gaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X-ray radiography. While copper(I)-iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning-guided discovery of copper(I)-iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X-ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high-performance Cu(I)-I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide-(1-Butyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and enables a detection limit for X-rays of 19.6&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X-ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X-ray imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrolytic Carbon: An Inexpensive, Robust, and Versatile Electrode for Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic organic electrochemistry is a highly useful redox method, enabling diverse transformations. This study explores pyrolytic carbon electrodes in powerful rAP processes and C&#8722;C as well as C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon offers a cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional amorphous carbon materials (glassy carbon, GC, or reticulated vitreous carbon, RVC), which are often expensive or unsuitable for large&#8208;scale flow reactions.







Abstract
Synthetic organic electrochemistry is recognized as one of the most sustainable forms of redox chemistry that can enable a wide variety of useful transformations. In this study, readily prepared pyrolytic carbon electrodes are explored in several powerful rAP transformations as well as C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon provides an alternative to classic amorphous carbon&#8208;based materials that are either expensive or ill&#8208;suited to large&#8208;scale flow reactions.

         <title>Organic Circularly Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: Strategies, Applications and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) is essential in chemistry and materials&#8208;related fields. This Review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP from the molecule to the supramolecular assembly scales, focusing on design strategies such as chirality transfer, assembly&#8208;induced chirality amplification, and chiral superstructure&#8208;mediated transmission. Remaining challenges and an insightful outlook are also presented.







Abstract
Organic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays crucial roles in chemistry and biology for the potential in chiral recognition, asymmetric catalysis, 3D displays, and biological probes. The long&#8208;lived luminescence, large Stokes shift, and unique chiroptical properties make organic circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) a new research hotspot in recent years. Nevertheless, achieving high&#8208;performance organic CPP is still challenging due to the sensitivity and complexity of integrating triplet excitons and polarization within organic materials. This review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP, ranging from design strategies and photophysical properties to underlying luminescence mechanisms and potential applications. Specifically, the design strategies for generating CPP are systemically categorized and discussed according to the interactions between chiral units and chromophores. The applications of organic CPP in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, sensing, chiral recognition, afterglow displays, and information encryption are also illustrated. In addition, we present the current challenges and perspectives on developing organic CPP. We expect this review to provide some instructive design principles to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic CPP materials, offering an in&#8208;depth understanding of the luminescence mechanism and paving the way toward diverse practical applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Quadruple&#8208;Functionalised Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of multiple payloads within the same scaffold is a growing tendency in last generation Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). This paper reports the first strategy for the quadruple functionalization of therapeutic antibodies using four unique functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This is possible from multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies that result in highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody with retained affinity for the target.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a growing class of chemotherapeutic agents that have yielded striking clinical successes. However, the efficacy of ADCs often suffers from issues associated with tumor heterogeneity and resistance. To overcome these problems, a new generation of ADCs comprising a single monoclonal antibody with multiple different payloads attached, termed multi&#8208;payload ADCs, have been developed. Here we deploy multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies to generate highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody conjugates comprising up to four different functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This work, which includes the use of a site&#8208;specific cyclopropenone (CPO)&#8208;based reagent, represents the first example of a homogeneous multi&#8208;payload ADC with a payload count greater than two, and thereby facilitates the development of the next generation of ADCs.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis H2 production system over a class of Cu&#8208;based urea oxidation catalysts was developed. CuXO catalyst exhibits unique selectivity for clean N2 rather than toxic NO2&#8722;/NO3&#8722; and eliminates the risk of H2&#8208;O2 mixing. The industrial&#8208;scale membrane&#8208;free electrolyser based on this system successfully reduces H2 production cost to US$1.81&#8197;kg&#8722;1, lower than those of grey H2 while meeting 2030 technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50&#8197;kg&#8722;1) set by United States Department of Energy.







Abstract
Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which makes the cost of green hydrogen (H2) generation much higher than that of grey H2. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO) for replacing OER, fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.78&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81&#8197;kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50&#8197;kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.

         <title>Topology of Gemini&#8208;shaped Hexagonal Heterojunction for Efficient Stereoconvergent Transformation via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional heterostructure containing kinetic resolution and racemization catalyst was developed by alternate stacking of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;substitution, which has exhibited outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities for the efficient cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts.







Abstract
Despite recent advances in the combination of kinetic resolution and racemization for efficient stereoconvergent transformation, the poor stability and limited reaction activities of the products restrict their wide application in industrial production. To overcome these problems, Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;heterojunctions for one&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers were designed via hydrogen&#8208;bonding adhesion by racemization catalyst 1 and kinetic resolution 2 in this work. The polymers from the assembly of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons exhibit rapid catalytic behaviour with efficient selectivity for the desired configuration in the synthesis of tertiary alcohols with contiguous stereocenters through dynamic kinetic resolution for the nanoscale heterojunctions of dissimilar catalysts. Among them, the developed 2D polymers gave outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;% ee, 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) through the cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts. The heterojunctions varying dimensions and distances of dissimilar catalysts provide new insight for increasing the enantioselectivity of chiral organocatalysts.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Tin Halide Perovskite Films with High Structural Integrity for Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging Array Enabling Hidden Object Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provided a simple spin&#8208;coating technique for the preparation of quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films with high structural integrity and effective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response. Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables high structural integrity with more oriented crystal, reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited remarkable optoelectrical properties, including low dark current density of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;10&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, fast response time of 1.06&#8197;&#956;s, high responsivity value of 0.43&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1, large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm), and an ultralow noise current of 1.68&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;A&#8201;Hz&#8722;1/2, which were among the best NIR perovskite photodetectors. Ultimately, the high&#8208;resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array was fabricated on the thin film transistor backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) image sensors based on solution&#8208;processed thin film are gaining prominence in various applications, including security detection, remote sensing, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring, owing to superior penetration capabilities of NIR light. However, the reported perovskite image sensors suffer from limited resolution and performance due to poor structural integrity, bioincompatibility, and constrained response wavelength range from lead&#8208;based perovskite materials employed. In this study, we present non&#8208;toxic quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films, prepared via a simple spin&#8208;coating technique, that demonstrate high structural integrity and effective NIR response. Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables a more oriented crystal growth with reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm). Ultimately, due to the high structural integrity, the high&#8208;resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array, exhibiting reduced photo and dark response non&#8208;uniformity value, was fabricated on the thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT) backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition. This work pioneers the application of lead&#8208;free perovskite for high&#8208;resolution NIR imaging arrays.

         <title>Regulating Electric Double Layer via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Stable Solid/Electrolyte Interphase on Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation structure in the electric double layer (close to the Mg metal interface) is effectively modulated by self&#8208;assembled monolayer through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions in the magnesium conventional electrolyte. A stable and dense solid electrolyte interphase is induced to solve the interfacial stability problem.







Abstract
Modulating the cationic solvation structure with high donor&#8208;number (DN) additive is an effective strategy to construct a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Mg anode, which necessitates meticulous consideration of electrolyte chemistry and substantial quantities of additives. Notably, the electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to anode is pivotal role in SEI formation yet remains understudied. In this study, we propose a novel self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy by utilizing (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFTMS, only 2&#8197;vol&#8201;%, 1.4&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 0.135&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1), a low DN but strong Mg metal absorbability through electron&#8208;withdrawing groups(&#8722;CF3), to modulate the complex structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane. Through dipole&#8208;dipole interaction between the electronegative fluorine (&#8722;CF3 of TFTMS) and electropositive hydrogen (&#8722;CH3/&#8722;CH2 of solvents), TFTMS weakens solvent&#8208;Mg2+ coordination and thus enhances anion&#8208;Mg2+ interaction, inducing a stable and dense SEI with superior electronic insulation to realize horizontal Mg plating/stripping. Consequently, the designed electrolytes enable the symmetric cells to cycle stable for up to 1000&#8197;hours and reversible Mg plating/stripping under 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, they show favorable compatibility with various cathodes. More importantly, the SAM strategy has good generality in other electrolyte systems, demonstrating a simple and effective route to promote the practical application of rechargeable magnesium battery.

         <title>Targeted Genome Mining Facilitates the Discovery of a Promiscuous, Hyperthermostable Amidase from Thermovenabulum Gondwanense with Notable Nylon&#8208;Degrading Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastic waste accumulation poses a severe threat to human and ecosystem health. As current recycling methods are inadequate, biocatalytic degradation offers a more sustainable platform. Using genome mining, we discovered TvgC, a new 6&#8208;aminohexanoate oligomer endohydrolase (NylC). TvgC has no affiliations to nylon facilities, is the most thermostable and promiscuous, and has notable activity towards nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6.







Abstract
Plastics are ubiquitous in our ecosystems, and microplastic accumulation in the environment is an emerging global health concern. Since available recycling technologies are not economically competitive with primary plastic production, global use is expected to reach 1231 megatons by 2060, with 493 megatons leeching into the environment each year. To identify new nylon&#8208;recycling biotechnologies, targeted genome mining was used to identify thermostable enzymes capable of degrading polyamides. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel protein sourced from Thermovenabulum gondwanense: TvgC. TvgC is extremely stable, exhibiting a melting temperature of 93&#8201;&#176;C and no detectable losses in hydrolytic activity after one week at 60&#8201;&#176;C. While nylonases primarily process nylon&#8208;6, TvgC catalysed the degradation of both nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6 films, which are considerably more difficult to degrade. Finally, conversion experiments demonstrate that TvgC achieves a 1.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% conversion of nylon&#8208;6 film, comparable to that of the most highly engineered nylonases. This novel hyperthermostable protein represents an excellent starting point for future engineering of increasingly efficient nylonases.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of chiral sulfinimines to keteniminium ions generated through electrophilic amide activation enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement to yield enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. The transformation proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and chemoselectivity as well as functional group tolerance, and&#8212;in contrast to imide&#8208;based chiral auxiliary approaches&#8212;directly delivers stereochemically stable amide products.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one&#8208;pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxyamides.

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slightly varying the steric demand in the immediate proximity to an intermolecular recognition moiety, tailored the efficacy of the resulting assembled state as a seed for initiating supramolecular polymerization of other structurally related compounds. Accordingly, narcissistic as well as social self&#8208;sorting from the same binary mixture of molecularly trapped species were achieved depending on the addition sequence of different seeds.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.

         <title>Establishing Non&#8208;Stoichiometric Ti4O7 Assisted Asymmetrical C&#8722;C Coupling for Highly Energy&#8208;Efficient Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 achieves excellent adaptability with loaded Cu nanoparticles (Cu NP) to form highly conductible and stable Cu/Ti4O7 interface, which enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8722;C coupling between between Cu and Ti sites and accelerates the charge transfer for highly energy&#8208;efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide







Abstract
Exploring an appropriate support material for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst is conducive for stably producing multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from electroreduction of carbon monoxide. However, the insufficient metal&#8208;support adaptability and low conductivity of the support would hinder the C&#8722;C coupling capacity and energy efficiency. Herein, non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 was incorporated into Cu electrocatalysts (Cu&#8722;Ti4O7), and served as a highly conductive and stable support for highly energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical conversion of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies originated from ordered lattice defects in Ti4O7 facilitate the water dissociation and the CO adsorption to accelerate the hydrogenation to *COH. The highly adaptable metal&#8208;support interface of Cu&#8722;Ti4O7 enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8722;C coupling between *CO on Cu and *COH on Ti4O7, which significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier for C2+ products formation. Additionally, the excellent electroconductivity of Ti4O7 benefits the reaction charge transfer through robust Cu/Ti4O7 interface for minimizing the energy loss. Thus, the optimized 20Cu&#8722;Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits an impressive selectivity of 96.4&#8201;% and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 45.1&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products, along with a remarkable partial current density of 432.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our study underscores a novel C&#8722;C coupling strategy between Cu and the support material, advancing the development of Cu&#8208;supported catalysts for highly efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide.

         <title>Stereochemical Impacts on Acyclic Mechanochemical Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral acyclic mechanophore is used to study the role of stereochemistry on mechanochemical activation rate. The R,R/S,S benzopinacol enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster than the meso R,S diastereomer. DFT modeling suggests that the two hydroxyl groups syn to each other form an improving hydrogen&#8208;bond as the mechanophore is pulled. This bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl groups are forced to be anti to each other.







Abstract
The influence of stereochemistry on the mechanochemistry rate is studied using a new mechanophore based on a benzopinacol (BP) skeleton. Two sets of BP diastereomers, the meso R,S and the R,R/S,S were isolated, incorporated into the center of a poly(methyl acrylate), and their mechanical activation rate was measured in solution. Under mechanical stress, the central C&#8722;C bond in BP is cleaved, providing two independent benzophenone molecules with higher UV&#8208;absorption coefficient at 254&#8197;nm. Monitoring the reaction rate spectroscopically indicates that the chiral R,R/S,S enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster compared to the meso R,S diastereomer. In&#8208;silico modeling indicates that a hydrogen bond between the syn hydroxyls in the R,R diastereomer becomes shorter with stress, reducing the maximal force required for C&#8722;C bond scission, while this bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl are anti to each other. Our results indicate that in polymer where free rotation around bonds is possible, non&#8208;covalent interactions between backbone substituents, which are affected by relative stereochemistry, can play a fundamental role in the mechanochemical stability of the polymer.

         <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of five catalysts with the same roughness coefficient, Cu2O(d)700, CuO(d)700, CuCl(d)700, Cu(NP1)700 and Cu(NP2)700, was prepared to investigate the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The microcosmic environment of the catalysts was unified by controlling the roughness coefficient, which in turn ensured that the relationship between the crystal facet and the selectivity of C2+ was investigated under the same mass transfer conditions. A positive correlation between the percentage of Cu(100) and the selectivity of C2+ is revealed.







Abstract
Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factor for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8722;C coupling. At &#8722;1.07&#8197;V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3&#8201;%, with a partial current density of &#8722;21.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency&#8208;band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8722;C coupling efficiency.

However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper-based catalysts with identical roughness factor for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H-cell. Interestingly, CuO-derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8722;C coupling. At &#8722;1.07&#8197;V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; product reaches 44.3&#8201;%, with a partial current density of &#8722;21.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; product selectivity of derived-copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low-frequency-band linear CO (LFB-CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8722;C coupling efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Extraction of Precious Metals Using a Porphyrin&#8208;Integrated One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a porphyrin&#8208;integrated one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework was synthesized and applied to the recovery of precious metals, including gold, silver, and platinum. The adsorption and reduction of precious metal ions simultaneously proceeded to perform extremely high recovery efficiency, directly producing precious metal particles without further reduction or high&#8208;temperature treatment.







Abstract
Precious metals are valuable materials for the chemical industry, but they are scarce and pose a risk of supply disruption. Recycling precious metals from waste is a promising strategy, here we tactfully utilize light irradiation as an environmental&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;saving adjunctive strategy to promote the reduction of precious metal ions, thereby improving the adsorption capacity and kinetics. A newly light&#8208;sensitive covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF) was synthesized to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this light auxiliary strategy. The equilibrium adsorption capacities of PP&#8208;COF with light irradiation towards gold, platinum, and silver ions are 4729, 573, and 519&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which are 3.3, 1.9, and 1.2&#8197;times the adsorption capacities under dark condition. Significantly, a filtration column with PP&#8208;COF can recover more than 99.8&#8201;% of the gold ions in the simulated e&#8208;waste leachates with light irradiation, and 1&#8197;gram of PP&#8208;COF can recover gold from up to 0.15&#8197;tonne of e&#8208;waste leachates. Interestingly, the captured precious metals by PP&#8208;COF with light irradiation mainly exist in the micron&#8208;sized particles, which can be easily separated by extraction. We believe this work can contribute to precious metal recovery and circular economy for recycling resources.

         <title>Harnessing the Reactivity of Nitroarene Radical Anions to Create Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides by Electrochemical Reductive Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic reduction of 2&#8208;cinnamyl&#8208;substituted nitroarenes under constant current electrolysis affords a broad array of substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides through a mechanism involving a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom abstraction.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;substituted nitroarenes using a simple, undivided electrochemical cell with non&#8208;precious electrodes to generate nitroarene radical anions was developed. The nitroarene radical anion intermediates participate in 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer reactions to construct quinoline N&#8208;oxides bearing aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, alkenyl&#8208;, benzyl&#8208;, sulfonyl&#8208;, or carboxyl groups.

         <title>Spontaneous Generation of Alkoxide Radical from Alcohols on Microdroplets Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets. An electric field (~10&#8722;1&#8197;V/&#197;) combined with partial solvation at the air&#8208;water interface promotes the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8722; and H3O+ ions. The RCH2O&#8722; ions can subsequently undergo ionization to form RCH2O&#8901; radicals, which then isomerize to the more stable R&#8901;CHOH species.







Abstract
Water microdroplets have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary chemical behaviors, including the abilities to accelerate chemical reactions by several orders of magnitude and to trigger reactions that cannot occur in bulk water. One of the most striking examples is the spontaneous generation of hydroxyl radical from hydroxide ions. Alcohols and alkoxide ions, being structurally similar to water and hydroxide ions, might exhibit similar behavior on microdroplets. Here, we report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets through quantum chemical calculations, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ab&#8197;initio MD simulations, and mass spectrometry. Our results show that an electric field (EF) on the order of 10&#8722;1&#8197;V/&#197; and partial solvation at the air&#8208;water interface jointly promote the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8722; and H3O+ ions. QM/MM MD simulations indicate that RCH2O&#8722; can be ionized to produce RCH2O&#8901; radicals on the microdroplet surface. Furthermore, partial solvation and the EF collaboratively catalyze the isomerization of the RCH2O&#8901; radical into a more stable tautomer, R&#8901;CHOH. This study highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the widespread generation of radicals at the microdroplet surface and provides insights into the importance of fundamental alcohol chemistry in the atmosphere.

Multi&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycle donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures provide high&#8208;density accessible n&#8208;type triazines and p&#8208;type piperazines, achieving high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;kinetics organic cathode via a two&#8208;step 18&#8197;e&#8722; anion&#8211;cation coordination reaction. Integrated high discharge voltage and structure stability give the Zn&#8208;organic battery record energy density and cycle life (412&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles).







Abstract
Multiple redox&#8208;active amphoteric organics with more n&#8208;p fused electron transfer is an ongoing pursuit for superior zinc&#8211;organic batteries (ZOBs). Here we report multi&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;site donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures (AOSs) by integrating three&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type triazine motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type piperazine units via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. AOSs expose flower&#8208;shaped N&#8208;heteromacrocyclic electron delocalization topologies to promise full accessibility of built&#8208;in n&#8208;p redox&#8208;active motifs with an ultralow activation energy, thus liberating superior capacity (465&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) for Zn||AOSs battery. More importantly, the extended multiple donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;fused conjugated AOSs feature satisfied discharge voltage and anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, pushing both the energy density and cycle life of the ZOBs to a new level (412&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles@10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). An anion&#8211;cation hybrid 18&#8197;e&#8722; charge storage mechanism is rationalized for heteromacrocyclic modules of AOSs cathode, entailing six tert&#8208;N motifs coupling with CF3SO3&#8722; ions at high potential and twelve imine sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential. These findings constitute a major advance of amphoteric multielectron organic materials and stand for a good starting point for advanced ZOBs.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Self&#8208;Respiratory Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogel Electrolyte Interface Evoked Well&#8208;Distributed Deposition on Zinc Anode for Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Exploring efficient formation mechanisms, as well as self&#8208;renewing solid electrolyte interfaces, is essential for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This paper proposes a novel and straightforward method for forming the interface, introducing an organic&#8211;inorganic composite solid&#8208;to&#8208;gel electrolyte layer with high mechanical performance. The self&#8208;renovating mechanism is also discussed, which may accelerate the practical application of self&#8208;renovating interface in the field of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIB) have emerged as a promising technology in the realm of electrochemical energy storage. Despite its potential advantages in terms of safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and inherent safety, AZIB faces significant challenges. Issues attributed to unsupported thermodynamics and non&#8208;uniform potential distribution and deposition, present formidable obstacles that necessitate resolution. To tackle these challenges, a novel strategy adapting hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic in&#8197;situ derived solid&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel electrolyte interface (StHEI) has been developed from coordination reactions and self&#8208;respiratory process, establishing uniform diffusion channels by ion bridges and accelerating ion transport. Self&#8208;respiratory pattern of StHEI realized through in&#8197;situ inorganic component conversion further prolongs the protecting duration, which effectively mitigates corrosion and passivation but enhance the mechanical properties of the StHEI measured through Young's modulus. This novel StHEI promotes well&#8208;distributed potential lines within the Helmholtz regions. Zn2+ are finally induced to deposit and nucleate in a compact, fine, and uniform manner. Asymmetrical batteries assembled with the modified Zn electrode and bare Zn exhibit exceptional stability over 3000&#8197;h (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The asymmetrical Cu//Zn cell achieved an outstanding average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% over 1200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>High&#8208;Yielding Nanobelt Formation by Chirality&#8208;Assisted Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis is used to create chiral and enantiopure annulated nanobelts from their chiral precursors via a one&#8208;pot self&#8208;condensation process in 84&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;persistent conjugated nanobelts (CNBs) are fascinating synthetic targets. However, in most cases these are made in low overall yields by applying strategies of macrocyclization followed by (multiple) ring fusion reactions for nanobelt formation. Here, we describe the high yielding synthesis of enantiopure chiral nanobelts in 84&#8201;% yield by applying chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). The chiral nanobelts were investigated by UV/Vis and CD spectroscopy. By DFT calculations the aromaticity of these structures is discussed.

         <title>Activation and C&#8722;C Coupling of Aryl Iodides via Bismuth Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic formation of C&#8211;C bonds from aryl halides is a highly attractive but unexplored area in the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis. We report a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to forge C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds via C&#8211;H functionalization. The bismuth complex features two different light&#8208;driven processes: an MLCT transition that promotes oxidative addition into Bi(I) and an LLCT&#8208;enabled homolytic cleavage of aryl&#8211;Bi(III) bonds.







Abstract
Within the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis, the catalytic formation of C&#8722;C bonds using aryl halides would be highly desirable; yet such a process remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we present a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and subsequent coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to access C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) linkages through C&#8722;H functionalization. This unique reactivity is the result of the bismuth complex featuring two redox state&#8208;dependent interactions with light, which 1) activates the Bi(I) complex for oxidative addition via MLCT, and 2) promotes the homolytic cleavage of aryl Bi(III) intermediates through a LLCT process.

         <title>Chemoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone Catalyzed by a Simple Organoaluminum Complex to Prepare Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Functional Polyester</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents the controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy) to produce functionalizable P(MVL)ROP at room temperature. P(MVL)ROP with a high molar mass behaves as a tough thermoplastic with good mechanical properties comparable to isotactic PP. Moreover, MeAl(BHT)2 can also efficiently catalyzed the bulk depolymerization of P(MVL)ROP to recover MVL.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) as a bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional monomer has shown great promise to prepare closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyester with pendent functionalizable double bond. However, the chemoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of MVL still faces challenges including low polymerization temperature, expensive catalyst as well as high catalyst loading. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective and controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy), which can be easily prepared from commercially available trimethylaluminum and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol without purification. MeAl(BHT)2 exhibits much higher catalytic activity (TOF=668&#8201;h&#8722;1) than that of MeAl[Salen] (TOF=89&#8197;h&#8722;1), a commonly used organoaluminum catalyst. The high chemoselectivity and activity of MeAl(BHT)2 is proposed to originate from the cooperative activation of propagating chain&#8208;ends and monomers via the &#8220;coordination&#8208;insertion&#8221; mechanism. Remarkably, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P(MVL)ROP can be prepared in bulk using MeAl(BHT)2, which is not accessible by the previous catalysts. This study may advance the development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers considering the easy preparation, low cost and good catalytic performance of MeAl(BHT)2.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Se&#8722;S Bonds by Synergistic Rh(II)/Guanidine Catalysis Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Assistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric carbene insertion into the Se&#8722;S bond of PhSeSCN under synergistic catalysis by a dirhodium salt and a chiral guanidine is reported. Various selenylthiocyanatopropanoates were prepared in good yields and enantioselectivity and exhibited excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory activity against IL&#8208;1&#946;. A new chalcogen&#8208;bond activation mode is disclosed.







Abstract
The efficient construction of chalcogen&#8208;atom&#8208;based chiral compounds remains a challenge, despite the importance of organoselenium and organosulfur compounds in life and materials science. Chalcogen atoms can form net attractive interactions called chalcogen bonds, but it is an undeveloped tool to assist asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report an enantioselective insertion platform to install a stereogenic center bearing selenyl and thiocyano functional groups. Our method operates by synergistic catalysis by a chiral guanidine and an achiral dirhodium complex in a three&#8208;component or four&#8208;component reaction, through Se&#8722;S bond insertion into carbene species, competing successfully with the spontaneous racemic process and showing high regioselectivity. As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selenylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory toward IL&#8208;1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.

As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selenylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti-inflammatory toward IL-1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Berkeleyone A and Preaustinoid A through Epoxypolyene Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the highly oxidized berkeleyone A and preaustinoid A is reported. Key features include a bioinspired Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed epoxypolyene cyclization of epoxyallylsilane, which effectively constructs a 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic framework containing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core and stereoselectively controlling five chiral centers. Additionally, a tandem alpha&#8208;methenylation and neopentyl alcohol protection is accomplished using Eschenmoser's reagent.







Abstract
A bioinspired Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed epoxypolyene cyclization was developed to construct the tetracyclic framework containing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core and seven chiral centers. The usage of this approach for assembling these natural products of 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic skeleton with bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core is demonstrated by the total synthesis of highly oxidized berkeleyone A and preaustinoid A.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Gene Expression System Using a Caging&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Photoactivatable Dye</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced gene expression system was developed using a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye with a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator, QacR. This system allowed transcriptional activation with mild visible light exposure, large dynamic range, and simultaneous detection of the state of the effector molecule in cell&#8208;free and cellular conditions.







Abstract
Optical regulation of transcription using chemical compounds is an effective strategy to manipulate gene expression spatiotemporally. Conventional caging approaches with photoremovable protecting groups may require intense UV&#8208;light exposure and release potentially toxic byproducts. To address these problems, here we developed a light&#8208;mediated transcriptional regulation system by combining a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye PaX560 and a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator QacR. The cationic dye generated from PaX560 through traceless photoconversion bound QacR and reduced its repressor function, resulting in transcriptional activation. Importantly, this system allowed transcriptional activation with a large dynamic range under mild visible light exposure and simultaneous detection of the state of the photoactivated effector. This module was integrated into the T7 RNA polymerase expression system to demonstrate light&#8208;activated transcription in vitro and in living cells.

         <title>Characterization of Iminobismuthanes and Catalytic Reduction of Organic Azides via Bi(I)/Bi(III) Redox Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction between N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes and organic azides leads to isolation of elusive monomeric iminobismuthanes, which can be spectroscopically and crystallographically characterized. This novel reactivity led to the development of a protocol for the catalytic reduction of organic azides using pinacolborane (HBpin) under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of organobismuth(I) complexes with organic azides. Treatment of N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes with organic azides (acyl, sulfonyl, and bulky aryl) results in monomeric iminobismuthanes which can be structurally characterized &#8212;including the formal Bi=N double bond&#8212; by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Building upon the stoichiometric reactivity of the monomeric iminobismuthanes, catalytic reduction of a broad range of organic azides is developed. DFT calculations of the catalytic reaction pathway support the redox nature of the overall process.

         <title>Bioinspired &#8220;Intermolecular Pocket&#8221; in Soft Molecular Crystal of Porous Organic Cage&#160;Exhibiting Reversible Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous Organic Cages (POCs) have gathered a lot of attention in sorts of fields. Previous studies often focused on the functionalization of their intrinsic porosity, while the utilization of the extrinsic porosity has been seldom reported. To date, the rational construction of functionalized extrinsic porosity in POCs is a serious challenge, which still relies on trial and error. Inspired by hydrophobic proteins, in the contribution, a POC (namely NKPOC&#8208;DS) is obtained with hydrophobic &#8220;intermolecular pocket&#8221; as extrinsic porosity constructed through the assembly of disulfide bonds with hydrophobic groups, facilitating strong supramolecular interactions as confirmed by Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits a unique C2H6&#8208;selective "breathing behaviour" due to the presence of softness in its extrinsic porosity, which does not extend to other gases such as C2H4, CH4, CO2, N2, and H2. Such specific recognition of C2H6 thus provides NKPOC&#8208;DS with the ability to preferentially adsorb C2H6 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture. The innovative approach of biomimicry in the design of functional POCs provides new insights into manipulating the packing of cages, paving the way for potential applications in guest recognition and adsorption separations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that fluorinated polyphenylene P50 undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8211;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total. It is truly monodisperse (&#272; = 1.0) in nature, allowing for thorough spectroscopic characterizations. Unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure, distinct chiroptical properties, and intriguing through&#8208;cavity threading complexation are described. These results, in addition to those of H50&#8217;s lower congeners, H34 and H18, illustrate the great potential of folding&#8208;like SFAS in shaping random&#8208;coiled polymer chains into higher&#8208;order functional structures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2a and 2b, "framed" and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium 2a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8208;Rh(I) complex 2aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8208;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4a) or C&#8208;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2b C&#8208;H was found to reversibly activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transmembrane Ion Channels: From Natural to Artificial Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Mobility Differential Amplifier: Enhancing Pressure&#8208;Induced Voltage Response in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressured&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0 &#8211; 1 kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2 Pa with a fast response time of 18.1 ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate a human somatosensory network analogous PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin using arrayed pressure sensing. These capabilities hold great promise for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial and Temporal Visualization of Polymorphic Transformations in Pharmaceutical Tablets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) represents a cutting&#8208;edge method for non&#8208;destructive material analysis, offering the unique capability of providing molecular&#8208;level information with spatial resolution. In this study, we have applied XRD&#8208;CT to investigate pharmaceutically relevant tablets that have been subjected to a range of compression pressures typical in tablet manufacturing. By employing XRD&#8208;CT to pharmaceutical tablets, we reveal material changes without tablet destruction, thereby avoiding potential phase transformations during sample preparation that could lead to errors in the interpretation of the processes that have occurred. Utilizing a pressure&#8208;sensitive marker, glycolide, we have tracked changes within tablet structures induced by compression, pinpointing locations where glycolide undergoes pressure&#8208;induced transformation. Additionally, we conducted a follow&#8208;up study with analysis one month later, observing an in&#8208;situ hydrolysis reaction of glycolide within the tablets. Through the complementary use of electron diffraction, we have elucidated the structure of the hydrolysis product, further enhancing our understanding of temporal changes in the tablets.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term&#160;Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells Using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual live cells of up to 30 minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor activation, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of the ER&#8208;luminal protein calreticulin in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein dynamics in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect   VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Profiling Lysine Reactivity and Ligandability with Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000 covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100 endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes.

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Dual&#8208;Pore Molecular Crystal for Ethanol/Water and Benzene/Methanol Azeotrope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two&#8208;dimensional porous structure, namely TDTBA&#8208;1, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;&#8208;stacking of a single organic molecule with highly&#160;Td&#160;symmetry. Activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high&#8208;resolution gas chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;hybridized Fused&#8208;ring Electron Acceptor with High Dielectric Constant and Isotropic Charge Transport for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8208;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02%, surpassing the 13.31% achieved with Me&#8208;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolonging Charge Carrier lifetime via Intraband Defect Levels in S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Esterification of Phosphoric, Phosphonic and Phosphinic Acids with Organosilicates: Phosphorus Chemical Recycling of Sewage Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global concerns regarding the depletion and strategic importance of phosphorus resources have increased demand for the recovery and recycling. However, waste&#8208;derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Propylene/Propane Sieving Separation through Gate&#8208;Pressure Control within a Flexible Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. This strategy through designing HOFs with thermoregulatory gating effect is a powerful way to maximize the performance of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Eight&#8208;Membered O&#8208;Heterocycles through Cross&#8208;[4+4] Cycloaddition of Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral eight&#8208;membered rings embedded in tetraphenylene derivatives and hetero&#8208;analogues exhibit unique properties and allow diverse applications. A conceptually viable and straightforward approach to these frameworks is [4+4] cycloaddition, which still remains elusive. In this study, we describe the stereoselective cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloaddition of quinone methides (QMs), leading to the formation of oxa&#8208;analogues of tetraphenylene with exceptional chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The structures of these novel rigid eight&#8208;membered O&#8208;heterocycles were explored via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their stereochemical stability was elaborated through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermal racemization experiments. The developed methodology exhibited broad substrate scope and the resulting cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadducts could be readily transformed into valuable chiral building blocks. Our findings expanded the inherently chiral library of medium&#8208;sized rings and also contributed to the advancement of asymmetric cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadditions of quinone methides.</dc:description>

In this study, we describe the stereoselective cross-[4+4] cycloaddition of quinone methides (QMs), leading to the formation of oxa-analogues of tetraphenylene with exceptional chemo-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. The structures of these novel rigid eight-membered O-heterocycles were explored via single-crystal X-ray diffraction and their stereochemical stability was elaborated through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermal racemization experiments. The developed methodology exhibited broad substrate scope and the resulting cross-[4+4] cycloadducts could be readily transformed into valuable chiral building blocks. Our findings expanded the inherently chiral library of medium-sized rings and also contributed to the advancement of asymmetric cross-[4+4] cycloadditions of quinone methides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Declined Singlet&#160;but Constant Triplet&#160;Energy: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Triplet Blocking Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules have been widely investigated in organic light emitting diodes, etc. Small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap&#160;and high radiative constants&#160;are desired. The prevalent TADF molecules are via donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design, which&#160;is at the expense of reducing radiative constants. Herein, we demonstrated a new singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation approach to construct TADF with high radiative constant, based on triplet blocking effect, i.e., the extension of conjugation of a triplet constrainer (IB) leads to a gradually red&#8208;shifted singlet&#160;but a constant triplet&#160;energy, and therefore reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap controlled from monomer (IB), monomer&#8208;linker (IB&#8208;BF2), to dimer of IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. The natural transition orbital analysis indicates that singlet&#160;state is delocalized while triplet&#160;state is localized as confirmed by time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is reduced from 0.60 eV, 0.46 eV to 0.25 eV, while keeping faster radiation rate (around 10^8/s) than that of conventional donor&#8208;acceptor molecules (10^6 ~ 10^7/s). As a result, the emission mechanisms are regulated from fluorescence for IB, phosphorescence/TADF dual emissions for IB&#8208;BF2 to TADF for IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. This paper proposed a new approach of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation, which is crucial for fundamental photophysics and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Free Sulfate Groups in Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>General strategies for synthesizing sulfated oligosaccharides employ the protection of sulfate groups for glycosylation or post&#8208;sulfation after the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, the chemical behavior of free sulfate groups in glycosylation reactions has not been thoroughly studied. We examined several glycosyl donors with free sulfate groups, but neither glycosyl imidates nor thioglycosides achieved products. Conversely, activating 6&#8208;sulfated GalNAc donors with either a 2&#8208;NTroc group or 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group using an ortho&#8208;hexynylbenzoate group at the anomeric position yielded &#946;&#8208;glycosides in good yield. These results indicate that glycosylations with a free sulfate group can be performed and that the neighboring group participation of 2&#8208;NHTroc and 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl groups works even with an unprotected sulfate group at 6&#8208;position. Ab initio calculations supported the formation of acyloxionium&#8208;cation via 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation. Additionally, glycosylation reactions under various counter cations of the sulfate group, such as Na+, Li+, K+, Ba2+ and pyridinium were examined. Results showed that sodium and lithium salt donors yielded the products in good yield. These results were also supported by ab initio calculations. Practical glycosylation reactions between disaccharide donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with free sulfate groups successfully yielded the sulfated tetrasaccharides. This study also discusses how a sodium salt acts as a protecting group during glycosylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;packed Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors.  However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8208;7.5 &#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8208;6.5 &#197; along &#960;&#8208;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8208;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone&#8208;packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutanes are prominent structural components in natural products and drug molecules. With the advent of strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven synthesis, ring&#8208;opening reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) provide an attractive pathway to construct these three&#8208;dimensional structures. However, the stereoselective difunctionalization of the central C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bonds remains challenging. Reported herein is a covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy that exploits radical NHC catalysis to achieve diastereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of BCBs under mild conditions. The Breslow enolate acts as a single electron donor and provides an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical with appropriate steric hindrance, which effectively distinguishes between the two faces of transient cyclobutyl radicals. This operationally simple method tolerates various fluoroalkyl reagents and common functional groups, providing a straightforward access to polysubstituted cyclobutanes (75 examples, up to &gt;19:1 d.r.). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations of this organocatalytic system confirm the formation of the NHC&#8208;derived radical and provide an understanding of how stereoselective radical&#8208;radical coupling occurs.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Charge Transfer in Conjugated Polymers with Pendant Benzothiadiazole Acceptor for Simultaneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge&#8208;transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge-transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety. The pendant benzothiadiazole, as revealed in both in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can act as electron "reservoir" that aggregates electrons at the active sites. Moreover, the presence of charge-transfer channels, evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), accelerates the electron transfer, preventing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, in this elaborately-designed architecture, the photogenerated electron can move smoothly towards the reduction sites, facilitating the reduction of O2 into H2O2, while remaining holes are directed to oxidation centers, simultaneously oxidizing furfuryl alcohol to furoic acid. The optimized photocatalyst LCP-BT demonstrates a competitive catalytic performance with H2O2 productivity of 868.3 &#956;mol L-1 h-1 (9.8 times higher than conventional random charge-transfer polymer LCP-1) and furfuryl alcohol conversion over 95% after 6 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A series of triylenes of the heavy group 13 elements gallium, indium and thallium, carrying the pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyl ligand is reported. The compounds were characterized in solution and in the solid&#8208;state and their donor ligand properties in heterobimetallic complexes were investigated, whereby a series of tungsten carbonyl complexes was isolated. Furthermore, a new synthetic route towards a previously described lithium&#8208;aluminum heterobimetallic dimetallocene is reported, which also enabled the isolation of a heterobimetallic polydecker of lithium and gallium.</dc:description>

         <title>GlutaR: A&#160;High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Protein&#8208;Based Sensor for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Glutamine Dynamics In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real&#8208;time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity, and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed&#160;in situ&#160;titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of GS and GLS differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments. Finally, we demonstrate GlutaR&#8217;s ability to monitor dynamic glutamine levels in muscle and liver tissues of diabetic mice&#160;in vivo.&#160;These findings collectively demonstrate GlutaR as a versatile tool for the spatiotemporal characterization of glutamine metabolism in living cells and tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneously Blinkogenic Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Localization&#8208;Based Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging relies on the fluorescence ON/OFF switching of fluorescent probes to break the diffraction limit. However, the unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes cause non&#8208;targeted ON/OFF switching, resulting in substantial fluorescence background that significantly reduces localization precision and accuracy. Here, we report a blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains blinking OFF until it binds to HaloTag, thereby triggering its self&#8208;blinking activity and enabling its application in direct SMLM imaging in living cells without wash&#8208;out steps. We employed the ratio of the duty cycle before and after self&#8208;blinking activation, termed as the parameter "RDC" to characterize blinkogenicity. The covalent binding to HaloTag induces HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo to transition from a fluorescent OFF state to a fluorescence blinking state. This transition also leads to a change in the RDC value, which is calculated to be 12, ensuring super&#160;blinkogenicity to effectively suppress background signals in living cells. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo was successfully applied in dynamic SMLM imaging of diverse intracellular sub&#8208;structures with minimal background noise, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Branched Alkanes by Upcycling of Waste Polyethylene over Controlled Acid Sites of SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Branched alkanes, which enhance the octane number of gasoline, can be produced from waste polyethylene. However, achieving highly selective production of branched alkanes presents a significant challenge in the upcycling of waste polyethylene, and the maximum selectivity for branched alkanes reported up to date is about 70%. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot process to convert polyethylene into gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons (C4&#8208;C13) with yield of 73.3% over SO42&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst at 280 &#176;C. The proportion of branched alkanes reaches 90.1% within the C4&#8208;C13 fraction. Incorporation of sulfate group endows the catalyst with strong Lewis acid sites and weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy, in situ small angle neutron scattering, and DFT calculations reveal that polyethylene activation occurs through the synergy between sulfate groups and strong Lewis acid sites (Zr sites). The weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites preferentially catalyze the isomerization and type A &#946;&#8208;scission processes, which favors the formation of branched alkanes, while suppressing competing reactions that produce straight&#8208;chain alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus via electronic effects of organic functional groups for enhanced hydrogen production activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic effects of organic functional groups play a fundamental role in determining the rate and/or direction of organic chemical reactions. The implementation of this concept in selective organic catalysis is achieved by tuning the electronic effects of organic functional groups to alter the corresponding reactivity. However, this approach has hardly been applied to modulate the band structure of inorganic materials. Here, we show that modulating the electronic band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP) is possible via the electronic effects of organic functional groups covalently modified on its surface. Organic functional group can either donate or withdraw charge density from BP surface, which will alter the bonding/anti&#8208;binding orbitals occupancy and thus shift the band&#8208;edge positions of functionalized BP downward/upward. Therefore, the valence&#8208;band maxima and the conduction&#8208;band minima of functionalized BP can be continuously tuned by changing the binding group with different Hammett parameters. Finally, unexpectedly high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light are achieved using functionalized BP heterojunctions as photocatalysts. This work underscores the significant role of electronic effects in chemically controlling BP&#8217;s band structure, offering greater flexibility and affordability beyond physical method limits.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Oxygen via the 3&#8208;Electron Pathway to Hydroxyl Radical by La&#8208;O4 Single&#8208;atom on WO3 for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shifting photocatalytic oxygen activation towards 3&#8208;electron (e&#8208;) pathway to hydroxyl radicals, instead of the normal 1 e&#8208; to superoxide radicals, becomes increasingly important for pollution degradation since hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential (2.80 V). Here, we demonstrate a selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3 e&#8208; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8208;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8208;WOv). Unsaturated&#8208;state La overcomes the rate&#8208;limited step of 2 e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1 e&#8208;. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1 e&#8208; to 3 e&#8208;. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4&#8208;WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3 mmol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, 35 and 8 times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8208;WOv with 0.077 min&#8208;1 of rate constant, 38 times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98% following five repeats, revealing a practical&#8208;utilization&#8208;level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated&#8208;state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.</dc:description>

Unsaturated-state La overcomes the rate-limited step of 2 e- oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1 e-. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1 e- to 3 e-. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4-WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3 mmol L-1 h-1, 35 and 8 times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4-WOv with 0.077 min-1 of rate constant, 38 times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98% following five repeats, revealing a practical-utilization-level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated-state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Using a New&#160;Pt(II) Source to Make Pt(II) Lantern&#8208;Shaped Cages, Including Low&#8208;Symmetry, Heteroleptic, and Multicavity Examples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current synthetic methods towards Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages involve the use of dry solvent, inert atmosphere, lengthy reaction times, and highly variable yields if isolated. Starting materials such as [Pt(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 suffer from a poor shelf&#8208;life, reducing the synthetic accessibility of various Pt(II) architectures. A new Pt(II) source (with varied counterions), [Pt(3&#8208;ClPy)4](X)2 (3&#8208;ClPy = 3&#8208;chloropyridine, X = BF4&#8208;, OTf&#8208;, NO3&#8208;), is developed and characterised, showing greatly enhanced shelf&#8208;life characteristics under ambient atmospheric conditions. Using this starting material, the assembly of Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages was completed in as little as 1.5 hours with wet solvent and ambient atmosphere. The first examples of low&#8208;symmetry, heteroleptic and multicavity Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages are reported using this approach. Attempts towards an M6L8 octahedron using a tritopic ligand instead generate an interesting M2L4 cage with unbound pyridyl arms. Ligands and cages are characterised by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography in some cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates are&#160; interesting candidates for supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in&#160;energy conversion or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity. In this work, pillar[5]arene was successfully grafted onto a Lindqvist hexavanadate and the resulting structure was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, presenting the first example of a crystal structure of a polyoxometalate covalently functionalized with a pillar[5]arene. By introducing a ditopic guest molecule that could interlink pillar[5]arene moieties, host&#8208;guest interactions were leveraged as the driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies incorporating hexavanadate clusters in a controlled manner. The enhanced catalytic performance of the resulting aggregates confirmed their potential application as functional catalytic materials. This novel approach for developing hexavanadate&#8208;based catalysts reported here showcases the potential of using host&#8208;guest interactions as a means to introduce catalytically active metal&#8208;oxo clusters into supramolecular frameworks.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino alcohols, particularly remote amino alcohols and peptide alcohols, are valuable due to their functional diversity in biologically active compounds. However, traditional synthesis methods face significant challenges, making electrochemistry an attractive alternative. We have developed a mild and biocompatible sequential paired electrolysis strategy, leveraging copper&#8208;electrocatalysis to synthesize diverse remote amino alcohols, including unnatural peptide alcohols. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that water serves as both the hydroxyl source and the solvent, facilitating the generation of CuH with Cu(I) at the cathode, which in turn reduces the aldehyde intermediates formed during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emitting Copper(I) Indenediyltrisphosphine Complexes with Minimized Skeletal Vibrations and Configurational Disorder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission spectra, which plays an important role in determining color purity, may not always receive sufficient attention in the design of emissive materials.&#160;Particularly for the red&#160;emitter, the traditional focus has been on emission maxima, yet broad FWHM values can significantly change the perceived color.&#160;For example, the red color (lem&#160;=&#160;616&#8211;677 nm) emitted from reported Cu(I) complexes is perceived as orange to yellow if FWHM is large. To reduce FWHM, we incorporated a strained and rigid metalaphosphadicyclopenta[a,f]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes using trisphosphine ligands featuring a 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl backbone (ITP).&#160;Herein, we present the synthesis, structure, and emission properties of&#160;ITP&#8208;MX&#160;and&#160;the&#160;congeners, showcasing genuinely deep&#8208;red emission with narrow FWHM values of 56 nm. These materials exhibit color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram, unlike reported broader&#8208;emitting counterparts. Measurement of the entropy of disorder of the emissive crystal by a recently reported statistical mechanical method revealed a quantitative correlation between FWHM and the increase in the number of microstates (the degree of freedom) of the crystals and suggested that mechanical stress can increase the entropy of the crystal, which results in emission broadening.</dc:description>

         <title>Reassessing the Photochemical Upcycling of Polystyrene Using Acridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approaches aimed at deconstructing PS by photocatalytic means struggle to generate high&#8208;energy species capable of cleaving the C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C bonds of PS. We show herein that 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate (MA) is capable of upcycling various grades of PS susbstrates into benzoic acid (BAc) up to 40%, with small proportions of acetophenone and formic acid, under visible light (456 nm) or through solar radiation. Time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy evidence that a reaction with oxygen is the primary photochemical step in oxygen&#8208;saturated solutions, accounting for 77% of the photons absorbed vs. 1% for the direct reaction with PS. These results suggest a mechanism in which MA&#8208;mediated photocycling of PS to BAc occurs through the abstraction of benzylic H atoms by reactive oxygen species generated by energy or electron transfer from the excited state of MA. Addition of triplet O2 to these radicals, followed by intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), generates C&#8208; or O&#8208;centered radicals then undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission or hydroperoxide fragmentation. The formation of intermediate oligomers functionalized by terminal carbonyl groups is demonstrated by both infrared analysis and mass spectrometry. These oligomers undergo further photoinduced conversion in the absence of MA, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9% and 91.4% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Near&#8208;Infrared Irradiation for Heating Mechanochemical Reactions in Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Doped Epoxy Milling Jars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Albeit mechanochemistry is a novel promising technology that give access to reactivity under solvent&#8208;free conditions, heating such reactions is sometimes compulsory to obtain satisfactory results in terms of conversion, selectivity and/or yield. In this work, we developed a novel approach using a dye that absorbs NIR photons and release the energy as heat. Hence, de novo milling jars in epoxy resin doped with the dye were thus produced to obtain reactors that would produce heat upon irradiation at 850 nm. Temperature profiles were recorded, depending on the irradiance, dye charge in the resin, and milling frequency, showing an excellent control of the temperature. The usefulness of the heating jar was then demonstrated in mechanochemical reactions that are known to require heat to yield the desired product, namely Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high activation energies and the newly developed rearrangement of a sydnone into corresponding 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Modulation of Nanographenes Enabled by Defects, Size and Doping for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) thanks to their low cost, environmental friendliness, excellent electrical conductivity, and scalable synthesis. The perspective of replacing precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts with functionalized graphene is highly desirable for reducing costs in energy conversion and storage systems. Generally, the enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes is typically deemed to originate from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect. All these factors can efficiently modify the charge distribution on the sp2&#8208;conjugated carbon framework, bringing about optimized intermediate adsorption and accelerated electron transfer steps during ORR. In this review, the fundamental chemical and physical properties of nanographenes are first discussed about ORR applications. Afterward, the role of doping, size, defects, and their combined influence in boosting nanographenes&#8217; ORR performance is introduced. Finally, significant challenges and essential perspectives of nanographenes as advanced ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual Ratiometric Probes with Unique Recognition Site for Quantitatively Visualizing H2S2 in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen persul&#64257;de (H2S2) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H2S2 in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H2S2 probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2)&#160; for quantitatively visualizing H2S2 in vivo. This probe shows dual&#8208;ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (I840/I1000, 107&#8208;fold) and photoacoustic (PA800/PA900, 6.5&#8208;fold) responses towards Na2S2 species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#160;nM), improved water solubility, and deep&#8208;tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H2S2 levels in the liver&#8208;injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H2S2&#8208;related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H2S2 imaging agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Proton Conduction in Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Manganese Batteries via Constructing Highly Connected Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elusive ion behaviors in aqueous electrolyte remain a challenge to break through the practicality of aqueous zinc&#8208;manganese batteries (AZMBs), a promising candidate for safe grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. The proposed electrolyte strategies for this issue most ignore the prominent role of proton conduction, which greatly affects the operation stability of AZMBs. Here we report a water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with efficient proton transfer pathways based on the large&#8208;space interlayer of montmorillonite and strong&#8208;hydration Pr3+ additive in AZMBs. Proton conduction is deeply understood in this quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte. Pr3+ additive not only dominates the proton conduction kinetics, but also regulates the reversible manganese interfacial deposition. &#160;As a result, the Cu@Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell could achieve a high specific capacity of 433 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.4 mA cm&#8211;2 and an excellent stability up to 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.2% at 0.8 mA cm&#8211;2 in such water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for the first time. Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with mass loading of 15.19 mg cm&#8211;2 sustains 100 cycles after initial activation, which is much better than its counterparts. Our work provides a new path for the development of zinc metal batteries with good sustainability and practicality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polydisperse edge&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrin nanoribbons have been synthesized by Yamamoto coupling followed by gold(III)&#8208;mediated fusion, with average degrees of polymerization of up to 37 repeat units (length 31 nm). Time&#8208;resolved optical&#8208;pump terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate that photo&#8208;generated charge carriers have dc mobilities of up to 205 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 in these nanoribbons, exceeding the values previously reported for most other types of nanoribbon or &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Fused Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes through Lewis Acid Catalyzed Highly Selective C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange Reaction between Bicyclobutanes and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl&#8208; as well as alkenyl&#8208;, but also alkyl&#8208;substituted diaziridines (up to 98% yield). Conducting a scale&#8208;up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;based chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was developed for the enantioselective version of this reaction (up to 96% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective and Homochiral Supramolecular Polymerization of Nanotadpole Aggremers of Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well&#8208;explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality&#8208;amplified co&#8208;assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw&#8208;sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Electrodes Enhance the Electrocatalytic Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase is of interest to future biotechnologies targeting the production of &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen (H2). We recently developed a simple two&#8208;step functionalized procedure to immobilize the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) on mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to achieve elevated H2 production with high operational stability, with current densities of 8 mA cm&#8211;2. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to understand how mesoporous ITO stabilizes and activates CpI for electroenzymatic H2 production. Examination of the topography and morphology of the mesoporous ITO surface revealed a hierarchical morphology containing cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates. Any potential effect of mesoporosity was investigated by comparing the stability and electroenzymatic activity of CpI on mesoporous &#8216;nanoITO&#8217; and planar ITO, where we determined that CpI has a higher turnover frequency and absorbs with greater stability (with respect to electroenzymatic activity over time) to nanoITO surfaces.</dc:description>

Ti=O, Mn&#8208;Cl, Fe&#8208;Cl, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga&#8208;Cl, Ag, In&#8208;Cl or Au&#8208;Cl]. This process is facilitated by the
efficient formation of the supramolecular heterodimer between TPP and (dipPhO)8PcM, which is
driven by the complementary shape and symmetry of the two macrocycles. The (dipPhO)8PcM
component directs the crystal structure of the heterodimers to form Phthalocyanine Nanoporous
Crystals (PNCs) of similar structure to those formed by (dipPhO)8PcM alone. The incorporation of
TPP appears to partially stabilise the PNCs towards the removal of included solvent and for cocrystals
containing (dipPhO)8PcCo stability can be enhanced further by the in&#8208;situ addition of 4,4&#8208;bipyridyl
to act as a &#8220;molecular wall tie&#8221;. These stabilised PNC/TPP cocrystals have a Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller
surface area (SABET) of 454 m2 g&#8208;1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22 ml g&#8208;1. The reactivity of both
macrocycles within the PNC/TPP co&#8208;crystals are demonstrated by in&#8208;situ metal insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Activated Dynamic Condensation Approach to Narrow&#8208;Band Gap Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl units intrinsically featuring less steric, nonpolarity, and unsaturated character, are well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;bridge used in the synthesis of high&#8208;performance semiconducting materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a promising class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, however, the range of available monomers for the reversible formation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds remains limited. In this study, a new class of 2D vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized using dimethyldiketopyrrolopyrrole&#160;(DM&#8208;DPP) as the key monomer. The strong electron deficiency of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) makes its methyl substituents readily activated upon the cocatalysis of L&#8208;proline and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine in aqueous solution to conduct dynamic condensation with tritopic aromatic aldehydes. The resulting COFs crystallized in an eclipsed AA stacking arrangement and featured abundant, regular nanochannels. Their robust vinyl DPP&#8208;linking mode enhanced donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugation and promoted &#960;&#8208;stacked alignment along the vertical direction. Consequently, the synthesized COFs exhibited band gaps as narrow as 1.02 eV and demonstrated excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability across the visible to near&#8208;infrared I (NIR&#8208;I) regions. Furthermore, the COFs could be converted into free&#8208;standing thin pellets through simple pressure casting, and show excellent photothermal response and cycling stability under different light sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Stable Decomposition Products on Cathode Surfaces to Enable High Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide solid electrolytes such as Li6PS5Cl hold high promise for solid state batteries due to their high ionic conductivity; however, their oxidation potential of ~2.5 V is not compatible with high voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathodes such as LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (x&#8805;0.8). Here, we devise an effective, conformal and thin coating on the cathode active material guided by density functional theory, which suppresses the oxidative decomposition of Li6PS5Cl as shown by experiment. The nanometric coating on nickel&#8208;rich NMC85 enabled capacity retention of 82% after 200 cycles (2.8&#8208;4.3 V vs Li+/Li) using Li6PS5Cl as the solid electrolyte. In comparison, cells with an uncoated CAM only displayed 56% capacity retention. The coated&#8208;NCM85 cells also demonstrate much better rate performance and higher capacity. The enhanced performance is due to the formation of a stable amorphous cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase accruing from the decomposition products of the LiPO2F2 precursor (as predicted by DFT), which protect the sulfide electrolyte from oxidation. The coating fabricated in this cost&#8208;effective process showed superior performance to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coatings such as LiNbO3. This work highlights the importance of rationally designing stable coating materials based on their potential decomposition products and confirms the suitability of a low&#8208;cost and conformal coating to enable sulfide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Stereoselective Synthesis of Hexa&#8208;aryl Borazines and their sp&#178;&#8208;Based 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borazine and its derivatives can be considered critical doping units for engineering hybrid C(sp2)&#8208;based molecules with tailored optoelectronic properties. Herein, we report the first synthesis of&#160;hexaarylborazines that, bearing&#160;ortho&#8208;substituted aryl moieties, extend three&#8208;dimensionally.&#160;Using a one&#8208;pot protocol, we first form an electrophilic chloroborazole and then react it with an aryl lithium (ArLi). By selecting the appropriate&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent, we can guide the ArLi to add to the BN&#8208;core in a specific way, ultimately controlling the stereochemical outcome of the three&#8208;substitution reaction. Rationalization of the stereochemical model through computational analysis allowed us to show that&#160;when aryl lithium nucleophiles bearing rigid long&#8208;range&#160;ortho&#8208;substituents&#160;are used,&#160;i.e.,&#160;stiff substituents. The&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent shields its side of the electrophilic B3N3&#160;core, biasing the incoming ArLi to add&#160;anti&#160;at each addition step, forming the final tri&#8208;aryl borazine exclusively as&#160;cc&#8208;isomer.&#160;Leveraging this stereoselective approach, prototypical multichromophoric borazine derivatives were prepared, and we showcased how the stereochemical arrangement of these chromophores distinctly influences their redox behavior.&#160;This methodology paves the way for previously inaccessible borazines to serve as&#160;privileged precursors&#160;to transcend the conventional bidimensionality associated with graphenoid systems and pioneer the construction of new forms of three&#8208;dimensional C(sp2)&#8208;based architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Phosphotriester&#8208;Masked Dideoxy&#8208;cGAMP Derivative as a Cell&#8208;Permeable STING Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger in which guanosine and adenosine are connected by one 3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; and one 2&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; phosphodiester linkage. It is formed in the cytosol upon detection of pathogenic DNA by the enzyme guanosine&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). cGAMP subsequently binds to the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to elicit an innate immune response leading to the production of type I interferons and cytokines. STING agonists are a highly promising avenue for an immuno&#8208;oncological anticancer therapy. A particular challenge with cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists are the two negative charges of the phosphodiester linkages, which strongly reduce the ability of such compounds to penetrate cell membranes. The development of cell&#8208;permeable STING agonists that can stimulate the immune system, enhancing their anticancer potency is currently of utmost importance in the field. Here, we report the development of a dideoxy derivative of cGAMP as a phosphotriester prodrug, where the negative charge of the phosphate backbone has been masked with a thioester. We found that this thioester&#8208;protected compound features a dramatic increase in its cellular potency that rises from EC50 = 5 mM to 25 nM. The new compound is envisioned to enable an efficient STING&#8208;agonist&#8208;based anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.</dc:description>

By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer-by-layer assembly of surface-anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3%, achieving a forty-fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor-based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well-defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge-carrier mobility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Aldehyde&#8208;Reduction Catalysis Through Catalyst Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a light&#8208;responsive tetrahedral metal&#8211;organic capsule that binds a perrhenate catalyst, which is released selectively upon irradiation with 350 nm light, turning on the catalytic reduction of organic carbonyls by hydrosilanes. The catalytic activity can be switched off by heating at 75 &#176;C for 2.5 h, which stimulates capsule reformation and catalyst re&#8208;encapsulation. Multiple on&#8208;off cycles were shown, with a clear relationship between product yield and light irradiation time. Encapsulation thus enables the coupling of light&#8208;responsiveness to catalysis in a manner that might be generalized to other catalysts and capsules.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfurized Composite Interphase Enables a Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability and reversibility of Zn anode can be greatly improved by in&#8208;situ construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface via a low&#8208;cost design strategy of ZnSO4 electrolyte. However, the role of hydrogen bond acceptor &#8208;SO3 accompanying ZnS formation during SEI reconstruction is overlooked. In this work, we have explored and revealed the new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in&#8208;situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) on Zn anode electrochemistry in ZnSO4 aqueous electrolytes. Structure characterization and DFT demonstrate that the introduction of &#8208;SO3 can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Owing to the synergistic effect of ZnS and &#8208;SO3, a high cycling stability of 1500 h with a cumulative&#8208;plated capacity of 7.5 Ah cm&#8208;2 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 has been achieved within the symmetrical cell. Furthermore, the full cell with NH4V4O10 cathode exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1 and maintaining a Coulombic efficiency of 100%. These new insights into anionic synergistic strategy could significantly enhance the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Sequence&#8208;Controlled Copolymerization of Lactones: Tailoring Material Properties from Robust Plastics to Tough Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copolymerization stands as a versatile and potent method for tailoring polymer properties by adjusting structural unit composition and sequence distribution. However, achieving sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization in a one&#8208;step and one&#8208;pot process remains challenging. This study introduces a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy to produce block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL). The distinct kinetics of the two monomers enable the facile synthesis of diblock and triblock copolyesters, PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Ph&#8208;BL)&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL), in non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as dichloromethane and toluene. Conversely, coordinating solvents like tetrahydrofuran, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4&#8208;dioxane, and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane facilitate frequent transesterifications, yielding statistical copolyesters P[CL&#8208;stat&#8208;(4Ph&#8208;BL)] with varying ratios of heterosequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that coordinating solvents stabilize the transition state for transesterification, thereby validating their role in triggering this process. By varying the microstructures and compositions, the resultant copolyesters display tunable thermal and mechanical properties, evolving from robust plastics with an ultimate tensile strength of up to 46.3 &#177; 3.1 MPa to tough elastomers with &gt;99.3% elastic recovery. All the copolyesters exhibit remarkable thermal stability (Td,5% = 376 &#176;C) and maintain desirable chemical circularity (&gt;92%), supporting a closed&#8208;loop life cycle for sustainable material economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Replaces Weak: &#8203;Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Anchored Electrolyte Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite aqueous electrolytes offer a great opportunity for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their practical application suffers from the parasitic side reactions and poor temperature adaptability stemming from weak hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network in free water. Here, we propose the guiding thought &#8220;strong replaces weak&#8221; to design hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane (SL) for disrupting the regular weak HB network and contributing to superior temperature tolerance. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that SL can remodel the primary solvation shell of metal ions, customize stable electrode interface chemistry and restrain the side reactions. Consequently, symmetric supercapacitor constructed by activated carbon (AC) electrodes is able to fully work within a voltage range of 2.4 V and reach high capacitance retention of 89.8% after 60000 cycles. Additionally, Zn anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping behaviors and a wide temperature range (&#8208;20 ~ 60 &#176;C), and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor (Zn//AC) also delivers an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 99.7% after 55000 cycles, implying that the designed electrolyte has practical application potential in extreme environments. This work proposes a novel critical solvation strategy that paves the route for the construction of ultra&#8208;stable and wide&#8208;temperature aqueous energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>2D/2D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks/Covalent Organic Frameworks S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) &#160;demonstrate significant potential for application in photocatalysis. However, the low efficiency of electron&#8208;hole separation and limited stability inhibit their practical utilization in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Herein, the novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between HOF&#8208;H4TBAPy (Py&#8208;HOF, H4TBAPy represents the 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis (p&#8208;benzoic acid) pyrene) and Py&#8208;COF was successfully established using a rapid self&#8208;assembly solution dispersion method. Experimental and theoretical investigations&#160; confirm that the size&#8208;matching of two crystalline porous materials enables the integrated heterostructure material with abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and an enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric field, thus significantly improving the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability. Notably, the optimal HOF/COF heterojunction achieves a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 390.68 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 2.28 times higher than that of pure Py&#8208;HOF and 9.24 times higher than that of pure COF. These findings precisely acquire valuable atomic&#8208;scale insights into the ingenious design of dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This work presents an innovative perspective for forming supramolecular S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions over HOF&#8208;based semiconductors, offering a protocol for designing the powerful and strong&#8208;coupling&#160; S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields for efficient solar energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Desymmetrization to Enrich Structural Diversity of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Toxic Chemical Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel structures provides significant opportunities for developing porous solids with new properties and enriching the structural diversity of functional materials for various applications. The rational design of building units with specific geometric conformations is essential to direct the construction of MOFs with unique properties. Herein, we leverage a ligand desymmetrization approach to construct a series of new MOFs. A flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed and assembled with a Zr6 cluster, generating four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures: NU&#8208;2600, NU&#8208;2700, NU&#8208;2800, and NU&#8208;1802, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators during synthesis. Except for NU&#8208;1802, these represent entirely new topologies. Notably, NU&#8208;1802 exhibits structural flexibility, with up to a 74% reduction in the unit cell volume as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Given their microporous structures, we studied the adsorption behaviors of n&#8208;hexane and 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to explore the structure&#8208;property relationships of these MOFs. Overall, this work highlights ligand desymmetrization as a powerful method to enrich MOF structural diversity and access complex MOFs with non&#8208;default topologies suitable for applications such as toxic gas capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Proton Precompensation: Suppressing Deprotonation&#8208;Driven Lattice Collapse for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under Coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85 &#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000 h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55% than the control devices (23.03%).</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling iron oxide scale slag into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable ozone catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70% Fe2O3 and 40.30% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#183;O2&#8315;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59 &#956;g&#183;L&#8208;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twelve unprecedented terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers and their monomers were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27, which represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. Mechanically, DCTPP1 was a novel potential clinically effective biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.







Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Based PROTAC Enables Targeted Degradation of RNA Binding Protein FMRP for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PROTAC composed of G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL&#8208;33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.







Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper&#8208;expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP&#8208;targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP&#8208;targeting G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1&#8208;VHLL). Sc1&#8208;VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1&#8208;VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of Treg cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1&#8208;VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.

&lt;p&gt;A novel PROTAC composed of G-quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL-33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper-expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small-molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP-targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP-targeting G-quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1-VHLL). Sc1-VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiviral Agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants Inhibit the Conserved Viral Protein Nsp1&#8211;RNA Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID&#8208;19 spread. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small&#8208;molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.







Abstract
The ongoing global threats posed by COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, catalyzed by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, underscores the pressing need for effective antiviral strategies. The viral non&#8208;structural protein&#8197;1 (Nsp1) significantly influences pathogenicity by impeding host protein expression and enhancing viral RNA translation through its interaction with the stem&#8208;loop&#8197;1 (SL1) in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR). We have developed a novel dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay, designed to investigate the critical Nsp1&#8211;SL1 interaction, and identified P23E02 as a potential inhibitor. Our investigation, combining molecular docking studies and alanine mutagenesis, has unveiled that P23E02 disrupts Nsp1&#8211;40S ribosomal subunit interaction, liberating translational inhibition and empowering host antiviral responses. P23E02 exhibits antiviral efficacy against various sarbecoviruses, making it a promising candidate for combatting COVID&#8208;19 and related diseases. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nsp1/SL1 axis and lays the foundation for innovative antiviral interventions, ultimately fortifying global preparedness against future viral threats.

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type&#8201;2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD01&#8208;67 is a macrocyclic analog designed to selectively target the neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2), identified through an in&#8208;depth SAR study. Based on NT(7&#8211;12), in which Ile12 was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine, followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, this constrained peptide exerts non&#8208;opioid analgesic action and no opioid&#8208;related adverse effects, thus representing a new therapeutic option for pain management.







Abstract
The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8211;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9&#8197;nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.

         <title>Higher Affinity Enables More Accurate Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Human Saliva Using Aptamer&#8208;Based Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an Aptamer&#8208;based and Urease&#8208;mediated Litmus Test (AUT) to systematically evaluate the analytical performance of biosensors constructed with aptamers possessing varying binding affinities. The outcomes underscore the substantial impact of high binding affinity aptamers in enhancing clinical detection sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of developing aptamers with exceptionally high affinity to enable precise detection of viral infections in the face of future pandemics.







Abstract
Many aptamers have been generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&amp;ek), some of which have been engineered into dimeric and trimeric versions for enhanced affinity for diagnostic applications. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the utilities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric aptamers in diagnostic assays with real clinical samples to answer the question of what levels of affinity an aptamer must have for accurate clinical diagnostics. Herein, we carried out a comparative study with two monomeric aptamers MSA1 and MSA5, one dimeric aptamer and two homotrimeric aptamers constructed with MSA1 and MSA5, with affinity varying by 1000&#8208;fold. Using a colorimetric sandwich assay to analyze 48 human saliva samples, we found that the trimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10&#8197;pM) can identify the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection much more accurately than the dimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;100&#8197;pM) and monomeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10,000&#8197;pM). Based on the experimental data, we theoretically predict the levels of affinity an aptamer needs to possess to achieve 80&#8211;100&#8201;% sensitivity and 100&#8201;% specificity. The findings from this study highlight the need for deriving very high affinity aptamers to enable highly accurate detection of viral infection for future pandemics.

         <title>The &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF Catalyzes Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in a Bimodal Pattern for Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl&#8208;ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation&#8208;condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.







Abstract
Fatty acids produced by the type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS&#8208;II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS&#8208;II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF&#8208;ACP complexes.

&lt;p&gt;The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon-carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;-Ketoacyl-ACP Synthase FabF in Type-II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl-ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation-condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatty acids produced by the type-II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS-II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;-ketoacyl-ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS-II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF-ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl-ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3-helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8-ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow-spectrum antibacterial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule&#8208;functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO2R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3d transition metal substitution can regulate the spin configuration of CoOOH, the intermediate state CoMnOOH has the largest lattice distortion, which contributes to the smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals. The electron in high energy eg orbital is much easier to lose compared to that in t2g orbital, uncovering the spin configuration&#8208;dependent formation of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process.







Abstract
Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M=V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8722;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report non&#8208;nephrotoxic trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine&#8208;appended, bacteria&#8208;targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click&#8208;to&#8208;release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two&#8208;component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.







Abstract
The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalised tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8722;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz in an in&#8197;vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.

The &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation between alkyl group and indole ring was identified as the driving force of this transformation through theoretical and experimental studies. The developed methodology was applied to obtain antitumor quindoline derivatives that exhibited substantial activity in both in vitro assays and in vivo models.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions, in which chemical bonds are redistributed between substrates and products, provide a general and powerful strategy for both biological and chemical synthesis. However, most isodesmic reactions involve either metathesis or functional&#8208;group transfer. Here, we serendipitously discovered a novel isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines that proceeds intramolecularly under weakly acidic conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole motif is broken and a new indole motif is constructed on the aniline side, accompanied by the formation of a new aniline motif. Mechanistic studies revealed the pivotal role of &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation on the nitrogen atom of the indole motif in driving this unusual isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, we successfully synthesized a diverse series of polycyclic indole derivatives; among quinolines, potential antitumor agents were identified using cellular and in vivo experiments, thereby demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Precise Manipulation of Electron Transfers in Clustered Five Redox Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of heterometallic pentanuclear complexes, and the overall picture of the electron transfers in the complexes. In addition, the unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were also identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers.







Abstract
Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena. Electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations clarified overall picture of the electron transfers in the pentanuclear complexes. In addition, unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers. Our results provide comprehensive guidelines for interpreting the complicated electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes.

&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines are valuable blocks in various biologically active molecules. An efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination system was developed for preparing the chiral moieties with high diastereo&#8208;, enantioselectivity and a large substrate scope.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74&#8201;% yield, &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1.

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>

The electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;into&#8208;C2+ oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.







Abstract
The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The in situ spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.

         <title>A Strep&#8208;Tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

The universal platform Strep&#8208;MIP, built using the synthetic polymer&#8208;based imprinting strategy, recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations provide comprehensive details of the binding, removal, reusability, and the catalytic performance of the immobilized enzymes, fostering the application of Strep&#8208;MIP in biotechnology.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide (Strep&#8208;MIP). Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tagged enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.

One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface-exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high-resolution structural data of flexible surface-exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin-based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep-tag II affinity peptide (Strep-MIP). Electrochemistry, surface-sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep-MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep-tagged enzymes: an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep-MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Vapor Responsive Metallo&#8208;Peptide Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, morphologies, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polyimide film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.







Abstract
Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid&#8208;state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one&#8208;dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H&#8208;bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air&#8208;drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis&#8208;)assembled at 60&#8211;70&#8201;% RH driven by a rebalancing of hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.

         <title>Traceless Nucleophile Strategy for C5&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an efficient strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of pyridines using transient enamine&#8208;type intermediates from N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process utilizes EDA complexes, achieving high selectivity without external photocatalysts. Our method offers late&#8208;stage functionalization capabilities that expand the pyridine modification toolbox and provide access to challenging meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst. The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.

         <title>Efficient Derivatization of a Thienobenzobisthiazole&#8208;Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Towards High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers based on thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) with alkyl, ester, and acyl groups are synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy, where the TBTz&#8208;monomers are efficiently synthesized via the common intermediate. Among them, the ester&#8208;functionalized polymer shows the highest power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaic cells with a small nonradiative voltage loss and a high charge generation efficiency.







Abstract
Derivatization is essential for optimizing organic material properties. However, because functional groups are often introduced at an early stage of the synthesis, similar intermediates have to be repeatedly synthesized to produce derivatives, which amounts to a daunting and time&#8208;consuming task. Using thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) as a building unit of donor polymers for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we demonstrate an efficient derivatization of a TBTz&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer by late&#8208;stage functionalization. In the developed synthetic route, functional groups are introduced at the last step of monomer synthesis, enabling us to easily synthesize several derivatives from a common intermediate. Ester and acyl groups are introduced into the polymer instead of the alkyl group, giving rise to deep HOMO energy levels and resulting in OPV cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage even in the absence of halogen substituents that are typically introduced into the donor polymers. Notably, the ester&#8208;functionalized TBTz&#8208;based polymer shows a small nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) of 0.19&#8197;V and has one of the highest charge generation efficiencies among the halogen&#8208;free donor polymers with similar &#916;Vnr, improving the critical trade&#8208;off relationship between voltage loss and charge generation. Our results provide an important guideline for the efficient development of high&#8208;performance polymers for OPVs.

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the dual effects of incorporating active LMs into solid&#8208;state composite PEO electrolytes, including providing additional free volume for segmental relaxation to enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity and acting as dynamic chemical traps to realize self&#8208;healing protection against dendritic problems. These combined effects enable Li/LiFePO4 full cells with notable rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>A Fluorinated Imide&#8208;Functionalized Arene Enabling a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor for Record&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms were introduced at the &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. The SA1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved a record efficiency of 19.33&#8201;% (certified PCE: 19.17&#8201;%). These results highlight that F&#8208;BTI is a promising unit for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer donors for all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) present compelling advantages for commercial applications, including mechanical durability and optical and thermal stability. However, progress in developing high&#8208;performance polymer donors has trailed behind the emergence of excellent polymer acceptors. In this study, we report a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms are introduced at the outer &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. SA1 exhibits a deep HOMO level of &#8722;5.51&#8197;eV, a wide bandgap of 1.81&#8197;eV and suitable miscibility with the polymer acceptor. Polymer chains incorporating F&#8208;BTI result in a highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within the all&#8208;polymer active layer. Thus, SA1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs exhibit an efficiency of 16.31&#8201;% with excellent stability, which is further enhanced to a record value of 19.33&#8201;% (certified: 19.17&#8201;%) by constructing ternary device. This work demonstrates that F&#8208;BTI offers an effective route for developing new polymer materials with improved optoelectronic properties, and the emergence of F&#8208;BTI will change the scenario in terms of developing polymer donor for high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8211;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8211;guest complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry. 7 exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8211;500&#8197;nm) due to containing two selenoviologen (SeV2+) units. Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132&#8197;&#956;mol), generation rate (11&#8197;&#956;mol/h), turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7&#8201;%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Lodged High&#8208;Valent High&#8208;Entropy Layered Double Hydroxide for Efficient, Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a convenient multi&#8208;ionic co&#8208;precipitation method to produce layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4). High valent and high entropy are simultaneously enabled in this LDH structure by embedding F&#8722; into individual layers of LDH to deliver both high catalytic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8722; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O&#8197;2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8722;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (61.3&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8&#8201;% after 1050 charge&#8211;discharge cycles).

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core Based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;W&#8208;03, a quasi&#8208;planar spiro&#8208;type hole&#8208;transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi&#8208;level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt;, a quasi-planar spiro-type hole-transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi-level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hole-transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state-of-the-art n-i-p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;-tetrakis(N,N-di-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9&#8242;-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-dopant and hydrophilic Li-TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro-type HTM with a critical quasi-planar core (&lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt;) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller-like conformation in spiro-OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi-planar HTMs interact with the Pb-dimer. Consequently, the device using &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; achieves a higher &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro-OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double-column &#960;&lt;i&gt;&#8211;&lt;/i&gt;&#960; stacking of &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; results in high hole mobility (~10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) even without &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD, those with &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt; exhibit enhanced stability under N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi-planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&lt;i&gt;&#8211;&lt;/i&gt;&#960; intermolecular stacking in &lt;b&gt;Z-W-03&lt;/b&gt;.

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are used to silence the activity of a payload and subsequently release this payload at a desired time and place using light irradiation. A fundamental property of PPGs crucial for their application is their efficiency of payload release, governed by the photochemical Quantum Yield (QY). Here we report a new strategy to improve the QY of PPGs through using a new sulfite self&#8208;immolative linker resulting in a five&#8208; to six&#8208;fold improved QY while simultaneously improving aqueous solubility.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages. Most importantly, it allows for spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>Sieving&#8208;type Electric Double Layer with Hydrogen Bond Interlocking to Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol constructs a sieving&#8208;type EDL through strong hydrogen bond interlocking, which can reduce the presence of H2O and SO42&#8722; at the interface to inhibit side effects. It also restricts the diffusion of SO42&#8722;, thereby increasing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Therefore, the electrolyte containing SDE significantly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The stability of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly affected by side reactions and dendrite growth on the anode interface, which primarily originate from water and anions. Herein, we introduce a multi H&#8208;bond site additive, 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol (SDE), into an aqueous electrolyte to construct a sieving&#8208;type electric double layer (EDL) by hydrogen bond interlock in order to address these issues. On the one hand, SDE replaces H2O and SO42&#8722; anions that are adsorbed on the zinc anode surface, expelling H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL and thereby reducing the content of H2O/SO42&#8722; at the interface. On the other hand, when Zn2+ are de&#8208;solvated at the interface during the plating, the strong hydrogen bond interaction between SDE and H2O/SO42&#8722; can trap H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL, further decreasing their content at the interface. This effectively sieves them out of the zinc anode interface and inhibits the side reactions. Moreover, the unique characteristics of trapped SO42&#8722; anions can restrict their diffusion, thereby enhancing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Consequently, utilizing an SDE/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability in Zn//Zn symmetrical cells and Zn//MnO2 full cells with lifespans exceeding 3500&#8197;h and 2500&#8197;cycles respectively.

         <title>Delocalized Orbitals over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

A general and modular synthetic strategy for covalent organic cages is reported. These cage receptors possess customized skeletons and sizes, diverse 3D structures, and excellent host&#8208;guest recognition for neutral aromatic diimides.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8722;E&#8722;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120&#176; (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60&#176; (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8722;E&#8722;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimide guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58&#177;0.18)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.

         <title>Near&#8211;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer is designed by introducing Se into heptamethine cyanine, which narrows the energy gap (&#916;Est) through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between Se atom and polymethine chain. The decreased &#916;Est together with increased spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) induced by heavy atom effect of Se effectively induces the ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation, breaking the bottleneck of weak1O2 generation of NIR photosensitizers.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840&#8197;nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51&#8197;eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44&#8197;cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61&#8201;%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850&#8197;nm irradiation (5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12&#8197;mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

Light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed natural killer (NK) cells were constructed for adoptive cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. The porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (NK@p&#8208;Fe) could generate active doxorubicin to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells, as well as immune agonists for activating NK cells and reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for NK cell infiltration.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, its practical application is still suffering from the decreased function and inadequate infiltration of NK cells in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Herein, we construct light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on the NK cell surface, a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities is formed. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate the active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze the production of the FDA&#8208;approved immune agonist imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role, inducing dendritic cell maturation for NK cell activation and reshaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cell infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for the modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.

The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; uptake/release in the aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries is firstly deciphered; together with the Mn redox reaction accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, the tailored manganese deficient MnO2 cathode with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; achieves an ultrahigh energy density and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability.







Abstract
Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra&#8208;capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO2&#8208;based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO2 micro&#8208;nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; (CaMnO&#8208;140) are prepared via a low&#8208;temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non&#8208;bonding O 2p states, the pre&#8208;intercalated Ca2+ can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations. The tailored CaMnO&#8208;140 cathode demonstrates an unprecedentedly high rate capability (485.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 154.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability (90.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 5000&#8197;cycles) in AZIBs. The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; (from the electrolyte) uptake/release, and the manganese redox accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, are elucidated by advanced synchrotron characterizations and theoretical computations. Finally, pouch&#8208;type CaMnO&#8208;140//Zn batteries manifest bright application prospects with high energy, long life, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability, and high operating safety. This study provides new perspectives for developing high&#8208;energy cathodes for AZIBs by initiating anionic redox chemistry.

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was discovered that sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit significantly different gas evolution behavior during discharge compared to the charging gas evolution observed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries during formation. This difference primarily arises from the high specific surface area and unique porous structure of the hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries, which facilitate a specific adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior of CO2 gas.







Abstract
In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.

The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in-depth analysis of the two-dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Multiple Active Sites for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well&#8208;regulated &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Regulating Nucleic Acid Catalysis Using Active Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we use active, fuel&#8208;dependent complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles and spatiotemporally control the catalytic activity of the 17E DNAzyme. Partitioning the biocatalyst into the peptide&#8208;RNA droplets results in unfolding and activity loss. The catalytic activity is recovered after droplets transiently dissolve when fuel is used up, mimicking they dynamic regulation of biocatalytic pathways in membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell&#8216;s pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptors Bearing Spiro&#8208;Substituted Bithiophene Units in Organic Solar Cells: Tuning the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distribution to Reduce Exciton Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). To tune the electronic structures for reducing Eb, we developed new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) featuring spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophenes. This NFA showed the separated frontier molecular orbitals, effectively lowering the Eb. Single&#8208;component and bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs based on this NFA showed enhanced photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), represented by ITIC, has contributed to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although tuning the electronic structures to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) is considered to promote photocharge generation, a rational molecular design for NFAs has not been established. In this study, we designed and developed two ITIC&#8208;based NFAs bearing spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene or biphenyl units (named SpiroT&#8208;DCI and SpiroF&#8208;DCI) to tune the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of NFAs. While the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of SpiroF&#8208;DCI and ITIC are delocalized in the main &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, the HOMO of SpiroT&#8208;DCI is distributed on the bithiophene unit. Reflecting this difference, SpiroT&#8208;DCI exhibits a smaller Eb than either SpiroF&#8208;DCI or ITIC, and exhibits greater external quantum efficiency in single&#8208;component OSCs. Furthermore, SpiroT&#8208;DCI shows improved PCEs for bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs with a donor of PBDB&#8208;T, compared with that of either SpiroT&#8208;DCI or ITIC. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements show that the photo&#8208;induced intermolecular charge separation is effective even in pristine SpiroT&#8208;DCI films. This study highlights the introduction of spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene units that are effective in tuning the FMOs of ITIC, which is desirable for reducing the Eb and improving the PCE in OSCs.

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed VO sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between VO and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.

&lt;p&gt;We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo-driven cross-coupling of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio-active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) coproduction over Pd-loaded TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid-base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor-based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high-performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value-added feedstocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of tune the electrocatalytic microenvironment via the introduction of C&#8722;F bonds can effectively break the scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH, and facilitate the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2, thereby resulting in significantly improving the performance of oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH)=&#916;G(*OH)+3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8722;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes is reported and enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under ligand&#8208;free conditions. Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles is achieved with chiral bisoxazoline ligands, providing access to &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.







Abstract
C(sp3) centers adjacent to (hetero) aryl groups are widely present in physiologically active molecules. Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkenes represents an efficient means of forging C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, boasting advantages as a wide source of substrates, mild reaction conditions, and facile selectivity manipulation. Nevertheless, the hydroalkylation of vinylarenes encounters constraints in terms of substrate scope, necessitating the employment of activated alkyl halides or alkenes containing chelating groups, remains a challenge. In this context, we report a general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes. Remarkably, this system enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under an extra ligand&#8208;free condition, demonstrating excellent coupling efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, through the incorporation of chiral bisoxazoline ligands, we have achieved regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.

         <title>Unconventional Luminescence Polymer with Color&#8208;Tunability based on Solvent&#8208;Induced Electrostatic Potential Distribution of Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The red delayed fluorescence polymer incorporating tetracoordinate boron were developed to study the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior. Modulating the emission wavelength of polymer depends on the solvent's electronic effects, which induce the equilibrium of the electrostatic potential distribution of fluorophore, as well as the strong intramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Tuning full&#8208;color emission of polymers holds significant promise. However, preparing unconventional luminescence polymers with color&#8208;tunability in dilute solution and understanding the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior remains a great challenge. We report two emitters (P1 and P2) incorporating tetracoordinate boron. The P1 with non&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, exhibited red delayed fluorescence at 645&#8197;nm with quantum yield of 9.15&#8201;% in aggregates. Notably, the emission wavelength of P1 can be tuned from 418 to 588&#8197;nm at different solvent. Similarly, the emission wavelength of P2 can also be adjusted by manipulating the interactions between the solvent and fluorophore. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the B&#8592;N bond and electronic interactions between solvent and fluorophore significantly regulate the equilibrium the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the intramolecular O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions of P1, thereby modulating its emission wavelength. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in fluoride ions detection. This work provides new insights into the complex effects of intermolecular interactions on luminescent properties.

         <title>Vertically Fluorinated Graphene Encapsulated SiOx Anode for Enhanced Li+ Transport and Interfacial Stability in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertically fluorinated graphene encapsulated SiOx anode with ultra&#8208;fast Li+ transfer and interfacial stability for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries was developed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of surface fluorination for the construction of LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interfaces.







Abstract
Achieving high energy density has always been the goal of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx has emerged as a compelling candidate for use as a negative electrode material due to its remarkable capacity. However, the huge volume expansion and the unstable electrode interface during (de)lithiation, hinder its further development. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of surface fluorinated SiOx (SiOx@vG&#8722;F), and investigate their influences on battery performance. Systematic experiments investigations indicate that the reaction between Li+ and fluorine groups promotes the in&#8197;situ formation of stable LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of SiOx@vG&#8722;F anode, which effectively suppresses the pulverization of microsized SiOx particles during the charge and discharge cycle. As a result, the SiOx@vG&#8722;F enabled a higher capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C in the SiOx@vG&#8722;F||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell. This approach will provide insights for the advancement of alternative electrode materials in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Allenylation</title>

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. Using racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile, this stereoconvergent reaction resulted in 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.).







Abstract
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>

CoFe Prussian blue analogs are transformed into CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts via CO2 laser irradiation, achieving high NH3 production rates from electrochemical nitrate reduction with excellent stability, thereby positioning the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.







Abstract
Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8197;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47&#8197;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost&#8208;effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations Toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;buckybowls, spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs), are synthesized by fusing together two dichalcogenasumanenes. Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro&#8208;buckybowls: in the S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzenes in the Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 displays second&#8208;harmonic generation.







Abstract
Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).

Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro-buckybowls: in the S-doped spiro-HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring-opening of the edge benzenes in the Se-doped spiro-HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te-doped spiro-HSE with Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; displays second-harmonic generation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three-dimensional (3D) curved &#960;-systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon-bridged spiro-type heterosumanenes (spiro-HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;-spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro-conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro-HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro-HSEs. Owing to the Jahn-Teller (&lt;i&gt;J-T&lt;/i&gt;) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro-HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro-HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value-added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S-doped spiro-HSE into thiophene &lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;-dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring-opening of the edge benzene of Se-doped spiro-HSE. The covalent adduct of Te-doped spiro-HSE with Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms non-centrosymmetric halogen-bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second-order nonlinear optics (NLO).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an arginine (Arg) residue adjacent to the latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa) significantly accelerates both SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This offers a general and biocompatible strategy to harness these robust click chemistries for fundamental and applied biological research, applicable in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.

         <title>Screening Strategy Identifies an Overlooked Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a strategy focusing on polar axial symmetry, a DUV transparent NLO crystal Mg2PO4Cl was discovered after screening over 10,000 phosphates. This crystal exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV compounds. Such a remarkable SHG effect can be attributed to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis.







Abstract
In the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) region, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals must meet stringent requirements, including a large optical band gap and sufficient second harmonic generation (SHG) response. Typically, these criteria are fulfilled by borates, carbonates and nitrates containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups. In contrast, sulfates and phosphates, with polarizabilities significantly smaller than those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, struggle to achieve similar performance. Here, we present the discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, a magnesium&#8208;based phosphate, identified from over 10,000 phosphates based on a polar&#8208;axial&#8208;symmetry screening strategy, which exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV transparent NLO crystals. This compound belongs to the Pna21 space group, with [PO4] units consistently aligned along the 21 screw axis and glide planes throughout its crystal structure. Theoretical calculations attribute its remarkable SHG effect to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis. Furthermore, a crystallographic structure analysis of phosphates and sulfates with significant SHG effects validates the effectiveness of our screening strategy. These findings offer valuable insights into the origins of NLO effects in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds from both a material design and structural chemistry perspective, inspiring future efforts to revitalize DUV phosphates.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering on RuO2 for Efficient Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

An anion modification strategy has been developed to improve the acidic OER performance of RuO2 by MoO3&#8208;stabilized sulfate anion, which exhibits the exceptional OER activity and stability in both acidic electrolyte and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
In acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500&#8197;hours with a very low degradation rate of 20&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 in acidic electrolyte. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 150&#8197;h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: Fact or Fiction? Correspondence on &#8220;Unlocking the Chain Walking Process in Gold Catalysis&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that contrary to literature reports the putative gold&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction is a two&#8208;stage process: gold&#8208;based heteroarylation followed by gold&#8208;free carbocationic rearrangements to olefins and tetrahydronaphthalenes.







Abstract
Two recent high&#8208;profile publications reported the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by MeDalPhosAuCl/AgOTf (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 8810) and their cyclisation to tetralines (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202312786). It was claimed that these were the first demonstrations in gold catalysis of alkene insertion into Au&#8208;aryl bonds, &#946;&#8208;H elimination and chain&#8208;walking by Au&#8722;H dications. We show here that in fact this chemistry is a two&#8208;stage process. Only the first step, the production of an alkyl triflate ester as the primary organic product by the well&#8208;known alkene heteroarylation sequence, involves gold. The subsequent formation of Heck&#8208;type olefins and their cyclisation to tetralines represent classical H+&#8208;triggered carbocationic chemistry. These steps proceed in the absence of gold with identical results. Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]2+ dication have no basis in fact.

The subsequent formation of Heck-type olefins and their cyclisation to tetralines represent classical H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered carbocationic chemistry. These steps proceed in the absence of gold with identical results. Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dication have no basis in fact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

Small Fish, big moves In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

Bioorthogonal chemistry has brought a revolution in our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems. However, the toolbox of bioorthogonal reactions is yet very limited. The field of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of mild and biocompatible chemical reactions, and thereby expanding the repertoire of bioorthogonal tools. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential for the selective generation of designed products within biorelevant or living settings.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems at the molecular level. However, the range of chemical reactions that can operate efficiently in biological environments without interfering with the native cellular machinery, remains limited. In this context, the rapidly growing area of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of bioorthogonal tools. The inherent mildness, tunability, chemoselectivity, and external controllability of photocatalytic transformations make them particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in biological and living systems. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential to enable the selective generation of designed products within biologically relevant or living settings.

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term durability of direct electrochemical seawater splitting for H2 remains a critical issue for its industrialization. This review provides a mechanistic overview of catalysts/interfaces for durable seawater electrolysis. The development of seawater electrolysis, challenges, rational strategies and synthesis methods for durable electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces in seawater, and innovations in design of electrolyzers are discussed.







Abstract
Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra&#8208;pure water is not readily available. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization. In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed. We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&#8722;adsorption, employing anti&#8208;corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&#8722; adsorption sites, inhibition of OH&#8722; binding to Mg2+ and Ca2+, inhibition of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation adherence, and co&#8208;electrosynthesis of nano&#8208;sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed. Furthermore, the prospects for developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. We found that researchers have rethought the role of Cl&#8722; ions, as well as more attention to cathodic reaction and electrolyzers, which is conducive to accelerate the commercialization of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Small Molecule RNA Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As one of the central molecules for life, RNA is connected to various processes involved in disease. Achieving a targeted, specific and irreversible RNA degradation is both a challenge and a highly valuable goal for pushing forward the development of new therapeutics. This minireview aims to summarize and provide mechanistic insights into every approach so far to drug and irreversibly degrade disease&#8208;associated RNA using small molecules.







Abstract
RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Introducing Phosphorus into the Overcrowded Thiele's hydrocarbon Family: Unveiling Contorted Main Group Diradicaloids with Dynamic Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing an anthracene&#8208;based secondary phosphine as a synthon, a straightforward and high&#8208;yielding synthetic method for P&#8208;doped overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) of the Thiele's hydrocarbon family is reported. Electrochemical analysis of the molecules unveils a dynamic redox behavior, wherein oxidation induces planarization and orthogonal twisting of the anthrylene unit relative to its end&#8208;capping (thio)xanthyl unit.







Abstract
Thiele's Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10&#8208;anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group&#8208;based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy for robust P&#8208;functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non&#8208;symmetric environment, incorporating (thio) xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character. Notably, the compounds exhibit dynamic redox behavior, leading to orthogonally twisted conformational changes upon oxidation, with a kinetically locked redox&#8208;couple.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Protocol to Access Silacyclobutanes with Unprecedented Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1&#8208;chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, a Ni-catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1-disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well-known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture- and air-sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step-efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents that demonstrate high efficacy for asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control.







Abstract
Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.

Ion&#8208;Pair Catalysis. A sustainable protocol that metal&#8208;free deuteration employing ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; catalysis, facilitating selective substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium in arenes, with broad compatibility and high yields, was reported.







Abstract
A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method&#8216;s practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8197;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide which acts as a useful building block for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access Si=B double bonded species were synthesized by a formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a Si(0) complex. The adjacent Br group and the vacant 3p(Si) orbital serves as reaction sites toward neutral and anionic nucleophiles for late&#8208;stage electronic tuning and synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a cyclopropene.







Abstract
Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8722;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source. The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular dynamic networks allow for regulation of protein function by dynamic allostery, but it has been unclear whether such networks can be positively modulated through protein&#8208;protein association. It is now shown that the formation of a protein&#8208;protein interface can motionally couple distant sites, turning preexisting structures into functional networks.







Abstract
Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#956;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.

         <dc:description>
Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction. This species has been charactertised in the solid&#8208;state and in solution.

Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction. This species has been characterized in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations are consistent with its formulation as a &#963;&#8208;complex derived from coordination of the zinc&#8211;hydride to a paramagnetic nickel(I) fragment. Continuous&#8208;wave and pulse EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution. Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D&#8208;exchange with D2 or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8722;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Copper Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyrimidinyl Phosphine with both Axial and P&#8208;Stereogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the first NHC ligand&#8208;enabled Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction to obtain axial and P&#8208;chiral phosphines. The product can undergo a SNAr reaction with many nucleophiles for the rapid synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines, renowned for their utility as ligands and catalysts, have been instrumental in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands possessing both axial and phosphine chirality remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the successful demonstration of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction using in situ generated secondary phosphine and heteroaryl chloride. By introducing a chiral NHC ligand and an achiral diphosphine auxiliary ligand, we effectively alleviated the poisoning effect caused by phosphine(III) compounds and suppressed the nonenantioselective background reaction. The reaction exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and good diastereoselectivity, with up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, when employing less sterically hindered secondary phosphines. This particular substrate poses a significant challenge due to its strong poisoning effect in copper catalysis.

         <title>Integration of Plasmonic Ag(I) Clusters and Fe(II) Porphyrinates into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupling with Photosynthesis of Pure H2O2</title>

Integrating Ag(I) clusters as oxidative sites and Fe porphyrinates as reductive sites into a metal&#8211;organic framework for artificial photosynthetic overall reaction to yield CO and pure 0.1&#8197;mM H2O2.







Abstract
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with the photosynthesis of pure H2O2 is a challenging and significant task. Herein, using classical CO2 photoreduction site iron porphyrinate as the linker, Ag(I) clusters were spatially separated and evenly distributed within a new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe. With water as electron donors, Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe exhibited remarkable performances in artificial photosynthetic overall reaction with CO yield of 36.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, as well as H2O2 evolution rate of 35.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Since H2O2 in the liquid phase can be more readily separated from the gaseous products of CO2 photoreduction, high&#8208;purity H2O2 with a concentration up to 0.1&#8197;mM was obtained. Confirmed by theoretical calculations and the established energy level diagram, the reductive iron(II) porphyrinates and oxidative Ag(I) clusters within an integrated framework functioned synergistically to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the robust connection of Ag(I) clusters and iron porphyrinate ligands facilitated efficient charge separation and rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Drive Tandem Electrocatalytic CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 catalysts with Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2 for the electroreduction of CO2, which exhibited excellent FEC2+ and FEEtOH. The coordinated tandem action of the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites enhanced the adsorption of the *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization, while stabilizing the crucial intermediate *CH2CHO, leading to improved selectivity towards C2+ and EtOH.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2 (Pz=Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9&#8201;% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5&#8201;% with remarkable stability when using 0.1&#8197;M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization on the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites play a synergistic tandem role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation of Acyclic 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl Alkenes as Limiting Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of E/Z&#8208;alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity.

Herein, we disclose a simple copper&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and E/Z&#8208;alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.

&lt;p&gt;The first copper-catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late-stage C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule&#8208;based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.







Abstract
Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &#951;10=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

Herein, we present the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox approach, coupling of aryl&#8208; and alkenyl iodides with acetone cyanohydrin generates the aryl&#8208; and vinyl nitriles efficiently.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reaction by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles. Combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the crucial role of cationic silver salts in activating the stable (P,N)&#8208;AuCN complex towards the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to subsequently generate key aryl&#8208;Au(III) cyanide complexes.
