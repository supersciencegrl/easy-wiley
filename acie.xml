         <title>Janus Nanocages of Platinum&#8208;Group Metals and Their Use as Effective Dual&#8208;Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus nanocages with distinctive platinum&#8208;group metals on the outer and inner surfaces can naturally catalyze at least two different reactions. Here we report a general method based on successive deposition and then selective etching for the facile synthesis of such nanocages. We have fabricated 11 different types of Janus nanocages characterized by a uniform size and well&#8208;defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6 nm thick. When tested as dual&#8208;electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and relative position of the metal layer. Density functional theory studies suggest that the alloy composition and surface structure of the nanocages both play important roles in enhancing the electrocatalytic activities by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>A self&#8208;catabolic multifunctional DNAzyme nanosponge for programmable drug delivery and efficient gene silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzyme&#8208;based genetherapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self&#8208;catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor&#8208;specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self&#8208;excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor&#8208;anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli&#8208;responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Zigzag Carbon Nanobelts through Scholl Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zigzag carbon nanobelts are a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after target for organic synthesis. Herein we report new strategies for designing and synthesizing unprecedented zigzag carbon nanobelts, which present a wave&#8208;like arrangement of hexagons in the unrolled lattice of (n,0) single wall carbon nanotubes (n = 16 or 24). The precursors of these zigzag carbon nanobelts are hybrid cyclic arylene oligomers consisting of  meta  &#8208;phenylene and 2,6&#8208;naphthalenylene as well as  para  &#8208;phenylene units. The Scholl reactions of these cyclic arylene oligomers form multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds selectively at the &#945;&#8208;positions of naphthalene units resulting in the corresponding zigzag carbon nanobelts. As monitored with fluorescence spectroscopy, one of these nanobelts binds C  60  with an association constant as high as (6.6&#177;1.1) &#215; 10  6&#160;  M  &#8722;1  in the solution in toluene. Computational studies combining linear regression analysis and hypothetical homodesmotic reactions reveal that these zigzag nanobelts have strain in the range of 67.5 to 69.6 kcal/mol, and the ladderization step through Scholl reactions is accompanied by increase of strain as large as 69.6 kcal/mol. The successful synthesis of these nanobelts demonstrates the powerfulness and efficiency of Scholl reactions in synthesizing strained polycyclic aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Liposomes as carriers of membrane&#8208;associated proteins and peptides for mass spectrometric analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition and are suitable for functional assays. We successfully demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas&#8208;phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein&#8208;lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Crown Ether Struts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crown ethers are a class of macrocyclic molecules with unique flexible structures but they are rarely integrated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). To date, employing flexible organic units such as crown ethers to construct COFs with high crystallinity and surface area are still a challenge. In this work, two new COFs with different flexible crown ethers as backbone rather than side chains are synthesized and further employed for alkali metal ions separation. Both of COFs possess high surface areas, good crystallinity, and excellent chemical stability. Interestingly, these two new COFs with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 or 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 units showed remarkable binding ability of K  +  or Cs  +  owing to the size&#8208;fit effect. This work demonstrated that the unique structural features of crown ethers will lead to increase interest in fabricating COFs with crown ethers.</dc:description>

         <title>Isotopic labelling of confined carbyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbyne is by excellence the one&#8208;dimensional allotrope of carbon consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms bonded to each other with exceptional strength. Its outstanding mechanical, optical, and electronic properties have been theoretically predicted, but its stability has only been achieved when grown encapsulated in the hollow core of doublewalled carbon nanotubes. One of the advantages of this confinement is that its properties can be controlled by the chain's length and surrounding environment. We investigated an alternative way of gaining control of its properties is using isotope labelling as tuning mechanism. This approach has been proven successfully in the other allotropes of carbon (diamond, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene). However, no report on isotopic labelling of 1D sp  1  &#8208;hybridized carbon systems is available. A very long basic carbyne structure in pristine form, whose properties can be followed by the Raman spectral response, is the key ingredient to gain real tunability of carbyne. Here, the optimized liquid precursor was first chosen among several options, which can greatly enhance the yield of the long confined carbyne, then isotopic labelled liquid precursors were encapsulated inside carbon nanotubes as carbon source for further synthesis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbyne is by excellence the one&#8208;dimensional allotrope of carbon consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms bonded to each other with exceptional strength. Its outstanding mechanical, optical, and electronic properties have been theoretically predicted, but its stability has only been achieved when grown encapsulated in the hollow core of doublewalled carbon nanotubes. One of the advantages of this confinement is that its properties can be controlled by the chain's length and surrounding environment. We investigated an alternative way of gaining control of its properties is using isotope labelling as tuning mechanism. This approach has been proven successfully in the other allotropes of carbon (diamond, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene). However, no report on isotopic labelling of 1D sp  1  &#8208;hybridized carbon systems is available. A very long basic carbyne structure in pristine form, whose properties can be followed by the Raman spectral response, is the key ingredient to gain real tunability of carbyne. Here, the optimized liquid precursor was first chosen among several options, which can greatly enhance the yield of the long confined carbyne, then isotopic labelled liquid precursors were encapsulated inside carbon nanotubes as carbon source for further synthesis. This allowed us to obtain pioneering results on isotope engineered carbyne with around 11.9% of  13  C&#8208;labelling using  13  C&#8208;methanol as precursor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards High Performance Zn&#8208;based Hybrid Supercapacitor via Macropores&#8208;based Charge Storage in Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;based aqueous supercapacitors are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported long&#8208;life and high&#8208;power performances are achieved with low Zn&#8208;utilization (&lt; 0.6%) and low mass loading in cathode (&lt; 2 mg cm  &#8208;2  ). And, many obtained high energy densities are generally evaluated without considering the mass of Zn&#8208;anode. Herein, we propose a Zn&#8208;based hybrid supercapacitor, involving a metal organic framework derived porous carbon cathode, a Zn&#8208;anode and an N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte containing Zn  2+  . We demonstrate that the charge storage of cathode mainly occurs in macropores, showing high rate performance at high mass loading (40 mg cm  &#8208;2  ). Furthermore, the aprotic nature of electrolyte and formation of Zn  2+  &#8208;DMF complex avoid the Zn&#8208;corrosion and dendrite formation. Therefore, the supercapacitor shows a long&#8208;life (9,000 cycles) with a high Zn&#8208;utilization (2.2%). When calculated with the total mass of cathode (40 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) and Zn&#8208;anode, the energy density reaches 25.9 W h kg  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Proton capture strategy for enhancing electrochemical CO2 reduction on atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen active sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysts play a key role in accelerating the sluggish electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer. Herein, we develop a proton capture strategy via accelerating the water dissociation reaction catalyzed by transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) adjacent to atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated single nickel (Ni&#8208;Nx) active sites to accelerate the proton transfer to the latter for boosting the intermediate protonation step, and hence the whole ECR process. This accelerated protonation process is amply demonstrated experimentally. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, together with theoretical calculations, reveals that Ni NPs accelerate the adsorbed H (Had) generation and transfer to the adjacent Ni&#8208;Nx sites for boosting the intermediate protonation and the overall ECR processes. This proton capture strategy is universal to design and prepare for various high&#8208;performance catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions even beyond ECR.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even duplicate the shell numbers with a narrow cavity between shells. Benefiting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP hollow multishell structures (HOMSs) with bubble&#8208;like shells and close duplicated shells can both form an effectively unique channel of water and gas, which can efficiently accelerate the entry of liquid and gas release.







Abstract
In the study of structure&#8211;property relationships for rational materials design, hollow multishell structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shell structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one&#8208;step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for enhanced capillary force. It can provide effective channels for water and gas and thus exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A possible way to trigger hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the basal&#8208;plane sites and make a MoS2 monolayer a single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalyst, is through long&#8208;range ferromagnetism order induced by magnetic cobalt ion doping. The effect of the doping promotes the hydrogen adsorption ability of basal S sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalysts with fully activated basal&#8208;atoms will provide a solution to the low loading&#8208;density bottleneck of single&#8208;atom catalysts. Herein, we activate the majority of the basal sites of monolayer MoS2, by doping Co ions to induce long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. This strategy, as revealed by in&#8197;situ synchrotron radiation microscopic infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, could activate more than 50&#8201;% of the originally inert basal&#8208;plane S atoms in the ferromagnetic monolayer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consequently, on a single monolayer of ferromagnetic MoS2 measured by on&#8208;chip micro&#8208;cell, a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could be achieved at the overpotential of 137&#8197;mV, corresponding to a mass activity of 28, 571&#8197;Ag&#8722;1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the multilayer counterpart. Its exchange current density of 75&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 also surpasses most other MoS2&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show the activation of basal plane S atoms arises from an increase of electronic density around the Fermi level, promoting the H adsorption ability of basal&#8208;plane S atoms.

         <title>Strategies and Perspectives to Catch the Missing Pieces in Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review brings out the key advancements made in the field of alkaline HER with metal hydroxides and their heterostructures and also provides a detailed and critical analysis of strategies and perspectives used with highlights on future prospects at the end.







Abstract
Transition metal hydroxides (M&#8208;OH) and their heterostructures (X|M&#8208;OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy&#8208;efficient alkaline HER.

     alt="Strategies and Perspectives to Catch the Missing Pieces in Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review brings out the key advancements made in the field of alkaline HER with metal hydroxides and their heterostructures and also provides a detailed and critical analysis of strategies and perspectives used with highlights on future prospects at the end.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal hydroxides (M&#8208;OH) and their heterostructures (X|M&#8208;OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy&#8208;efficient alkaline HER.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Amine&#8208;to&#8208;Azide Conversion on Native RNA via Metal&#8208;Free Diazotransfer Opens New Avenues for RNA Manipulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA using the reagent FSO2N3 selectively provides azide&#8208;modified RNA in quantitative yields. The stereochemically controlled reaction opens new avenues for the synthesis of RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates and for the isolation of cellular RNA containing post&#8208;transcriptional nucleotide modifications with an aliphatic primary amino group, such as acp3U.







Abstract
A major challenge in the field of RNA chemistry is the identification of selective and quantitative conversion reactions on RNA that can be used for tagging and any other RNA tool development. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA containing an aliphatic primary amino group using the diazotizing reagent fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3). The reaction provides the corresponding azide&#8208;modified RNA in nearly quantitatively yields without affecting the nucleobase amino groups. The obtained azido&#8208;RNA can then be further processed utilizing well&#8208;established bioortho&#8208;gonal reactions, such as azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (Click) or Staudinger ligations. We exemplify the robustness of this approach for the synthesis of peptidyl&#8208;tRNA mimics and for the pull&#8208;down of 3&#8208;(3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;carboxypropyl)uridine (acp3U)&#8208; and lysidine (k2C)&#8208;containing tRNAs of an Escherichia coli tRNA pool isolated from cellular extracts. Our approach therefore adds a new dimension to the targeted chemical manipulation of diverse RNA species.

         <title>On the Redox Mechanism of Low&#8208;Temperature NH3&#8208;SCR over Cu&#8208;CHA: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Reduction Half Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of transient response, kinetic, and computational methods reveals the crucial role of dinuclear Cu complexes also in the Reduction Half&#8208;Cycle (RHC) of the LT&#8208;SCR redox chemistry over Cu&#8208;CHA, and it explains the observed quadratic dependence of the RHC rates on CuII.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;CHA is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx in vehicle applications. Although extensively studied, diverse mechanistic proposals still stand in terms of the nature of active Cu&#8208;ions and reaction pathways in SCR working conditions. Herein we address the redox mechanism underlying Low&#8208;Temperature (LT) SCR on Cu&#8208;CHA by an integration of chemical&#8208;trapping techniques, transient&#8208;response methods, operando UV/Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy with modelling tools based on transient kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations. We show that the rates of the Reduction Half&#8208;Cycle (RHC) of LT&#8208;SCR display a quadratic dependence on CuII, thus questioning mechanisms based on isolated CuII&#8208;ions. We propose, instead, a CuII&#8208;pair mediated LT&#8208;RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite&#8208;precursor intermediates accounts for CuII reduction. These results highlight the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT&#8208;SCR, but also in the RHC reaction cascade.

         <title>The Reduced Nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] with Ge&#8722;Ge Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridogermanates(III), Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6], contain the hitherto unknown molecular anion [Ge2N6]12&#8722; featuring a Ge&#8722;Ge&#8208;bond and thus represent the first members of a novel class of compounds virtually unknown in the nitride chemistry of tetrel elements.







Abstract
The first nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] were synthesized from sodium flux and structurally characterized by powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. They crystallize isostructurally to each other and homeotypic to Ca6[Cr2N6]H in space group R
. They feature unprecedented, mutually isolated, ethane&#8208;like [GeIII2N6]12&#8722; anions in a staggered conformation. The compounds are semiconductors according to resistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations, yielding band gaps of 1.1&#8197;eV for Ca6[Ge2N6] and 0.2&#8197;eV for Sr6[Ge2N6].

         <title>Anodic Oxidation Enabled Cation Leaching for Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoCr2O4 activated at 1.7&#8197;V for 1.5&#8197;h (Act&#8208;CoCr2O4) exhibits better OER activity compared to IrO2 in alkaline solutions. Pristine CoCr2O4 is originally inactive; activation (&gt;1.56&#8197;V) promotes Cr leaching and lattice oxygen losses in CoCr2O4, leaving the highly defective surface for Co species to reconstruct into octahedrally coordinated Co3+&#8211;4+ oxyhydroxide.







Abstract
A rational design for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is pivotal to the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Much work has been devoted to understanding cation leaching and surface reconstruction of very active electrocatalysts, but little on intentionally promoting the surface in a controlled fashion. We now report controllable anodic leaching of Cr in CoCr2O4 by activating the pristine material at high potential, which enables the transformation of inactive spinel CoCr2O4 into a highly active catalyst. The depletion of Cr and consumption of lattice oxygen facilitate surface defects and oxygen vacancies, exposing Co species to reconstruct into active Co oxyhydroxides differ from CoOOH. A novel mechanism with the evolution of tetrahedrally coordinated surface cation into octahedral configuration via non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer is proposed. This work shows the importance of controlled anodic potential in modifying the surface chemistry of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Crystal Flexibility Design through Local and Global Motility Cooperation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible framework and its mobile aromatic substituents are connected via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. The flexibility integration endows the PCP with distinct guest&#8208;free structures depending on the activation approach. The flexible PCP discriminates C6 alkane isomers by different gate&#8208;open behaviors, suggesting its application potential on petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating.







Abstract
Incorporating local mobility into a flexible framework promises to create cooperative properties unattainable in a conventional soft porous crystal. In this study, we propose a design strategy that integrates substituent moieties and a flexible porous crystal framework via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This integration not only facilitates framework structural transitions but also gives the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) different guest&#8208;free structures that depend on the activation conditions. The incorporated flexibility gives the material the ability to discriminate C6 alkane isomers based on different gate&#8208;opening behaviors. Thus, the PCP has potential applications in C6 isomer separation, a critical step in the petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating. This strategy, based on ligand designability, offers a new approach to flexible PCP structural and functional design.

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss Achieved by a Pyridine&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine&#8208;based polymer semiconductor (PPY2) was introduced as the dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting material in inverted perovskite solar cells. It exhibits suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, effective passivation effects, and the capability of promoting the formation of a high&#8208;quality polycrystalline perovskite film. The devices based on PPY2 delivered an encouraging power&#8208;conversion efficiency up to 22.41&#8201;% with a high VOC of 1.16&#8197;V.







Abstract
Currently, the performance improvement for inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage (VOC) loss caused by detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination (NRR) processes. Herein, we report a simple and efficient way to simultaneously reduce the NRR processes inside perovskites and at the interface by rationally designing a new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), PPY2, which exhibits suitable energy levels with perovskites, high hole mobility, effective passivation of the uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide defects, as well as the capability of promoting the formation of high&#8208;quality polycrystalline perovskite films. In absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using PPY2 as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41&#8201;% with a small VOC loss (0.40&#8197;V), among the best device performances for inverted PVSCs reported so far. Furthermore, PPY2&#8208;based unencapsulated devices show an excellent long&#8208;term photostability, and over 97&#8201;% of its initial PCE can be maintained after one sun constant illumination for 500&#8197;h.

         <title>Stanene&#8208;Based Nanosheets for &#946;&#8208;Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) obtained by a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy could serve as a new type of sonosensitizer for ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT). In addition, SnNSs could serve as robust photothermal agents and carriers for photothermal therapy (PTT) and &#946;&#8208;elemene delivery. This study not only presents a robust strategy for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of SnNSs but also establishes general platforms for tri&#8208;modal combination cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a superior modality for cancer treatment owing to the non&#8208;invasiveness and high tissue&#8208;penetrating depth. However, developing biocompatible nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers with efficient SDT capability remains challenging. Here, we employed a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3&#8197;eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano&#8208;sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US&#8208;triggered separation of electron (e&#8722;)&#8208;hole (h+) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT&#8208;enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.

         <title>Independent Luminescent Lifetime and Intensity Tuning of Upconversion Nanoparticles by Gradient Doping for Multiplexed Encoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lanthanide sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) was studied. With gradient doping, independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning is realized.







Abstract
Luminescent materials with engineered optical properties have been developed for multiplexed labeling detection, where encoding capacity plays a pivotal role in the efficiency. However, multi&#8208;dimensional optical identities are usually not independent which essentially hinder the practical encoding numbers to access theoretical capacity. In this work, we carefully studied the sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and managed to achieve independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning. With the orthogonally tunability, it breaks the constraint of intensity (k) and lifetime (n) correlation and expands the practical encoding number to theoretical value as (k+1)n&#8722;1 in binary encoding. This method can also be combined with previous lifetime engineering as well to realize high level multiplexing.

         <title>A New Type of Supramolecular Fluid Based on H2O&#8211;Alkylammonium/Phosphonium Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique, highly incompressible fluid formed by a tight association of water molecules around ammonium and phosphonium salts is described in this paper. Applications of this new family of supramolecular fluids in different electrochemical processes are demonstrated in this work.







Abstract
Here we show that by adjusting the concentration of tetrabutyl ammonium and phosphonium salts in water (&#8776;1.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;m), hydrophobic solvation triggers the formation of a unique, highly incompressible supramolecular liquid, with a dynamic structure similar to clathrates, involving essentially all H2O molecules of the solvent. Despite the increasing local order, the thermal diffusivity, and compressibility of these supramolecular liquids is strongly decreased with respect to bulk water due to slower relaxation dynamics. The results presented in this paper open an avenue to design a new family of supramolecular fluids, stable under atmospheric conditions, which can find important technological applications in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Homolysis of Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal&#8208;Substrate Complexes: A Complementary Activation Strategy in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mainstream applications of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis predominately involve outer&#8208;sphere single electron&#8208;transfer (SET) or energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes either by precious metal Ru(II) or Ir(III) complexes or by organic dyes with low photostability. Earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based M  n  L  n  &#8208;type (M = metal, L  n  = polydentate ligands) complexes are rapidly evolving as alternative photocatalysts by offering not only economic and ecological advantages but also access to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere mecha&#173;nistic modes, thereby transcending their inherent limitations to be used as effective photocatalysts due to the possession of ultrashort excited&#8208;state lifetimes.

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Red Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among phosphorus&#8208;based nanomaterials, layered black phosphorus and violet phosphorus have been actively explored in the past decade. However, the synthesis of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs) has been lacking although red phosphorus (RP) is commercially available at low cost and has excellent chemical stability at room temperature. Herein we report an efficient strategy to fabricate RPNSs and doped RPNSs using cysteine as a reducing reagent. Data from  in vitro  and  in vivo  studies suggested that RPNSs can trigger reactive oxygen species overexpression, DNA damage and subsequent autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death in a shape&#8208;dependent manner. Our findings not only provide a method to construct layered RP nanomaterials but also present a unique mechanism of phosphorus&#8208;based materials in nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Allylation of Simple Arenes via C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Gem&#8208;difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a rhodium catalyzed directing&#8208;group free regioselective C&#8722;H allylation of simple arenes. Readily available  gem  &#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates via a sequence of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond activation, providing allyl arene derivatives in good yields with high regioselectivity under mild conditions. The robust methodology enables facile late&#8208;stage functionalizations of complex bioactive molecules. The high efficiency of this reaction is also demonstrated by the high turnover number (TON, up to 1700) of the rhodium catalyst on gram&#8208;scale experiments. Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio&#8208;enriched  gem  &#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The realization of regulating permeance and selectivity in membrane systems may allow effective relief of conventional energy&#8208;intensive separations. Here, pressure&#8208;responsive ultrathin membranes (~100 nm) fabricated by compositing flexible two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) with graphene oxide nanosheets for CO2 separation are reported. By controlling the gas permeation direction to leverage the pressure&#8208;responsive phase transition of the MONs, CO2&#8208;induced gate opening and closing behaviors are observed in the resultant membranes, which are accompanied with the sharp increase of CO2 permeance (from 173.8 to 1144 gas permeation units) as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities (from 4.1 to 22.8 and from 4 to 19.6, respectively). The flexible behaviors and separation mechanism are further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work establishes the relevance of structural transformation&#8208;based framework dynamics chemistry in smart membrane systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of cyanobacterial natural products containing fatty acid residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, massive sequencing and annotation of bacterial genomes has revealed an unexpectedly large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters whose products are yet to be discovered. For example, cyanobacterial genomes contain a large number of gene clusters that likely incorporate fatty acid&#8208;derived moieties, but for most cases we lack the knowledge and tools to effectively predict or detect the encoded natural products. Here, we exploit the apparent lack of a functional beta&#8208;oxidation pathway in cyanobacteria to achieve efficient stable&#8208;isotope labeling of their fatty acid&#8208;derived lipidome. We show that supplementation of cyanobacterial cultures with deuterated fatty acids can be used to easily detect natural product signatures in individual strains. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated in two cultured cyanobacteria by uncovering analogues of the multidrug&#8208;resistance reverting hapalosin, and novel, cytotoxic, lactylate&#8208;nocuolin A hybrids &#8211; the nocuolactylates.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperative Catalysis for Decarbonylative Heteroarylation of Carboxylic Acids via C&#8211;O/C&#8211;H Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative bimetallic catalysis represents a fundamental approach in modern synthetic chemistry that addresses many challenges associated with the evolution of the field. Herein, we report bimetallic cooperative catalysis for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of ubiquitous carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8211;O/C&#8211;H coupling. This novel catalytic system exploits the cooperative action of a copper catalyst and a palladium catalyst under decarbonylative regimen, which enables for the highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs that enjoy a privileged role in the realm of organic synthesis through the coupling of carboxylic acids with heteroarenes in the absence of prefunctionalization or directing groups. This cooperative decarbonylative platform benefits from the direct use of common carboxylic acids and shows a remarkably broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), including late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents. Extensive mechanistic and computational studies were conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of the bimetallic decarbonylative platform. The key step involves intersection of the two catalytic cycles via transmetallation of the copper&#8208;aryl species with the palladium(II) intermediate generated by oxidative addition/decarbonylation. We envision the versatile bimetallic cooperative decarbonylative framework will have an impact on planning synthetic approaches in cooperative catalysis, decarbonylative coupling and synthesis of biaryl motifs .</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrolysis of Aliphatic Bis&#8208;isonitriles in the Presence of a Polar Super Aryl&#8208;Extended Calix[4]pyrrole Container</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report binding studies of an octa&#8208;pyridinium super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor with neutral difunctional aliphatic guests in water. The guests have terminal isonitrile and formamide groups, and the complexes display an inclusion binding geometry and 1:1 stoichiometry. Using  1H NMR titrations and ITC experiments, we characterized the dissimilar thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the complexes. The  bis&#8208;isonitriles possess independent reacting groups, however, in the presence of 1 equiv. of the receptor the hydrolysis reaction produces mixtures of non&#8208;statistical composition and a significant decrease in reaction rates. The selectivity for the  mono&#8208;formamide product is specially enhanced in the case of the  bis&#8208;isonitrile having a spacer with five methylene groups. The analysis of the kinetic data suggests that the observed modifications in reaction rates and selectivity are related to the formation of highly stable inclusion complexes in which the isonitrile is hidden from bulk water molecules. The concentration of the reacting substrates in the bulk solution is substantially reduced by binding to the receptor. In turn, the hydrolysis rates of the isonitrile groups for the bound substrates are slower than in the bulk solution. The receptor acts as both a sequestering and supramolecular protecting group.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report binding studies of an octa&#8208;pyridinium super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor with neutral difunctional aliphatic guests in water. The guests have terminal isonitrile and formamide groups, and the complexes display an inclusion binding geometry and 1:1 stoichiometry. Using  1H NMR titrations and ITC experiments, we characterized the dissimilar thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the complexes. The  bis&#8208;isonitriles possess independent reacting groups, however, in the presence of 1 equiv. of the receptor the hydrolysis reaction produces mixtures of non&#8208;statistical composition and a significant decrease in reaction rates. The selectivity for the  mono&#8208;formamide product is specially enhanced in the case of the  bis&#8208;isonitrile having a spacer with five methylene groups. The analysis of the kinetic data suggests that the observed modifications in reaction rates and selectivity are related to the formation of highly stable inclusion complexes in which the isonitrile is hidden from bulk water molecules. The concentration of the reacting substrates in the bulk solution is substantially reduced by binding to the receptor. In turn, the hydrolysis rates of the isonitrile groups for the bound substrates are slower than in the bulk solution. The receptor acts as both a sequestering and supramolecular protecting group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Generic G Protein Peptidomimetics Able to Stabilize Active State Gs Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors for Application in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent an important group of membrane proteins that play a central role in modern medicine. Unfortunately, conformational promiscuity hampers full therapeutic exploitation of GPCRs, since the largest population of the receptor will adopt a basal conformation, which subsequently challenges screens for agonist drug discovery programs. Here, we describe a set of peptidomimetics able to mimic the ability of G proteins in stabilizing the active state of the &#946;  2  adrenergic receptor (&#946;  2  AR) and the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R). During fragment&#8208;based screening efforts, these (un)constrained peptide analogues of the &#945;  5  helix in G  s  proteins, were able to identify agonism pre&#8208;imprinted fragments for the examined GPCRs, and as such, they behave as a generic tool, enabling an engagement in agonist earmarked discovery programs.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of 2&#8208;Cyclohexenone by BF3 Coordination: Mechanistic Insights from Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acids have recently been recognized as catalysts enabling enantioselective photochemical transformations. Mechanistic studies on these systems are however rare, either due to their absorption at wavelengths shorter than 260 nm, or due to the limitations of theoretical dynamic studies for larger complexes. In this work, we overcome these challenges and employ sub&#8208;30&#8208;fs transient absorption in the UV, in combination with a highly accurate theoretical treatment on the XMS&#8208;CASPT2 level. We investigate 2&#8208;cyclohexenone and its complex to boron trifluoride and analyze the observed dynamics based on trajectory calculations including non&#8208;adiabatic coupling and intersystem crossing. This approach explains all ultrafast decay pathways observed in the complex. We show that the Lewis acid remains attached to the substrate in the triplet state, which in turn explains why chiral boron&#8208;based Lewis acids induce a high enantioselectivity in photocycloaddition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;resolution view of the coordination environment in a paramagnetic metalloprotein from its magnetic properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalloproteins constitute a significant fraction of the proteome of all organisms and their characterization is critical for both basic sciences and biomedical applications. A large portion of metalloproteins bind paramagnetic metal ions, and paramagnetic NMR has been widely used in their structural characterization. However, the signals of nuclei in the immediate vicinity of the metal center are often broadened beyond detection. In this work, we show that it is possible to determine the coordination environment of the paramagnetic metal in the protein at a resolution &#160;inaccessible to other techniques. Taking the structure of a diamagnetic analogue as a starting point, a geometry optimization is carried out by fitting the pseudocontact shifts obtained from first principles Quantum Chemical calculations to the experimental ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;Crosslinked Porous Polymeric Networks for the Removal of Micropollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers have been prepared for water purification. The structure of the polymer P1 could be easily modified to yield the anionic polymer P3, which showed particularly effective adsorption for cationic micropollutants. Theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of 454&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the dye methylene blue, 344&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for diquat were determined for P3.







Abstract
Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P1&#8211;P3) for removing organic micropollutants from water were prepared. A bowl&#8208;shaped &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraalkynyl calix[4]pyrrole and diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer were crosslinked via Sonogashira coupling to produce a 3D network polymer, P1. P1 proved too hydrophobic for use as an adsorbent and was converted to the corresponding neutral polymer P2 (containing carboxylic acid groups) and its anionic derivative P3 (containing carboxylate anion groups). Anionic P3 outperformed P2 in screening studies involving a variety of model organic micropollutants of different charge, hydrophilicity and functionality. P3 proved particularly effective for cationic micropollutants. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity (qmax,e) of P3 reached 454&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the dye methylene blue, 344&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for diquat. These uptake values are significantly higher than those of most synthetic adsorbent materials reported to date.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Aminopalladation&#8211;Heck Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylanilines with prochiral cyclopentenes in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2, a chiral bidentate pyrox ligand and O2 as terminal oxidant affords structurally diverse indole&#8208;cyclopentene conjugates bearing two stereocenters in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective manner.







Abstract
Domino processes initiated by intramolecular nucleopalladation of alkynes have been developed into powerful synthetic tools for the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles. However, a catalytic enantioselective version of this class of reactions remains scarce. We report herein that reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylanilines with prochiral cyclopentenes in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2, a chiral bidentate pyrox ligand and O2 as terminal oxidant affords the structurally diverse indole&#8208;cyclopentene conjugates bearing two stereocenters in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective manner. One of the products is converted to a heavily functionalized tetracyclic indolinone derivative.

         <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent bonds generated by chemical fuels are a fundamental tool for generating nonequilibrium reaction networks. In this Minireview, different approaches to transient bond formation are discussed, illustrating how similar fuel chemistry can be applied to a wide range of abiotic systems ranging from self&#8208;assembly to molecular machines.







Abstract
Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with by operating out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with by operating out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Organic Transformations Utilizing Carbon&#8208;Based Gas Molecules as Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;mediated fixation of carbon&#8208;based gas molecules: C&#8722;C bond formation utilizing carbon&#8208;based small gas molecules, including CO, CO2, acetylene, ethylene, ethane and methane, as feedstocks is attractive but challenging. The emergence of photoredox chemistry and the development of engineered flow technology have provided vast opportunities for gas conversions, which has gained tremendous momentum over the past decade.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based gas molecules are readily available feedstocks and are widely used in industry as building blocks or fuels. However, their application in the synthesis of fine chemicals has been hampered due to operational complexity, poor reaction efficiency and selectivity. Recent development of photoredox&#8208;promoted transformations using such gaseous reagents has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. In this review, efforts in developing light&#8208;promoted organic transformations using carbon&#8208;based natural gases as C1 or C2 feedstocks and to overcome the associated challenges are briefly summarized.

         <title>Anion Texturing Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode for Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion texturing approach is developed to achieve an (002) textured Zn with exposed in&#8208;plane orientated basal planes, where the role of anion interaction is explored. Benchmarking against its conventional (101) textured counterpart, Zn (002) texture enables highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free stripping/plating at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The reversibility of metal anode is a fundamental challenge to the lifetime of rechargeable batteries. Though being widely employed in aqueous energy storage systems, metallic zinc suffers from dendrite formation that severely hinders its applications. Here we report texturing Zn as an effective way to address the issue of zinc dendrite. An in&#8208;plane oriented Zn texture with preferentially exposed (002) basal plane is demonstrated via a sulfonate anion&#8208;induced electrodeposition, noting no solid report on (002) textured Zn till now. Anion&#8208;induced reconstruction of zinc coordination is revealed to be responsible for the texture formation. Benchmarking against its (101) textured&#8208;counterpart by the conventional sulphate&#8208;based electrolyte, the Zn (002) texture enables highly reversible stripping/plating at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, showing its dendrite&#8208;free characteristics. The Zn (002) texture&#8208;based aqueous zinc battery exhibits excellent cycling stability. The developed anion texturing approach provides a pathway towards exploring zinc chemistry and prospering aqueous rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Cryptic Sulfur Incorporation in Thioangucycline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptic incorporation of inorganic sulfur into thioangucycline biosynthesis was confirmed to be non&#8208;enzymatic by heterologous expression, systematic gene deletion, and in vitro experiments. A stable epoxide&#8208;containing angucycline was identified as the final natural product and precursor to the thioether&#8208;bridged angucyclines, likely as part of a hydrogen sulfide&#8208;mediated detoxification process.







Abstract
Sulfur incorporation into natural products is a critical area of biosynthetic studies. Recently, a subset of sulfur&#8208;containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether&#8208;bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B. However, systematic gene deletion of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by CRISPR/Cas9 could not identify any gene responsible for the conversion of the epoxide intermediate to TACs. Instead, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non&#8208;enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the TACs are proposed to derive from a detoxification process. These results are expected to contribute to the study of both angucyclines and the utilization of inorganic sulfur in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>A Macromolecular Drug for Cancer Therapy via Extracellular Calcification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a macromolecular&#8208;drug&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from blood. Polysialic acid combined with folate, which spontaneously induces biogenic mineral formation on cancer cells rich in folate receptors, leads to targeted pathological calcification and cell death. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia improves survival rates of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Cancer chemotherapy typically relies on drug endocytosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via intracellular pathways; however, severe side effects may arise. In this study, we performed a first attempt to develop macromolecular&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from the blood through a new type of drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), which selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells and results in the pathological calcification of tumors. The macromolecule&#8208;initiated extracellular calcification causes cancer cell death mainly by intervening with the glycolysis process in cancer cells. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibited cervical and breast tumor growth and dramatically improved survival rates in mice. This study provides an extracellular therapeutic approach for malignant tumor diseases via calcification that is ready for clinical trials and offers new insights into macromolecular anticancer drug discovery.

         <title>Tuning the H&#8208;Atom Transfer Reactivity of Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Complexes as Probed by Infrared Photodissociation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics of H&#8208;atom transfer mediated by iron(IV)oxo complexes with different cis&#8208;ligands can be studied in a modular flow reactor coupled to MS detection. The HAT reactivity correlates with the intrinsic properties of the isolated complexes in the gas phase. A ligand with a larger binding energy forms a more reactive complex for the HAT reactions, has a weaker FeIV=O bond, and forms a stronger FeIIIO&#8722;H bond after the HAT reaction.







Abstract
Reactivities of non&#8208;heme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complexes are mostly controlled by the ligands. Complexes with tetradentate ligands such as [(TPA)FeO]2+ (TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) belong to the most reactive ones. Here, we show a fine&#8208;tuning of the reactivity of [(TPA)FeO]2+ by an additional ligand X (X=CH3CN, CF3SO3&#8722;, ArI, and ArIO; ArI=2&#8208;(tBuSO2)C6H4I) attached in solution and reveal a thus far unknown role of the ArIO oxidant. The HAT reactivity of [(TPA)FeO(X)]+/2+ decreases in the order of X: ArIO &gt; MeCN &gt; ArI &#8776; TfO&#8722;. Hence, ArIO is not just a mere oxidant of the iron(II) complex, but it can also increase the reactivity of the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex as a labile ligand. The detected HAT reactivities of the [(TPA)FeO(X)]+/2+ complexes correlate with the Fe=O and FeO&#8722;H stretching vibrations of the reactants and the respective products as determined by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. Hence, the most reactive [(TPA)FeO(ArIO)]2+ adduct in the series has the weakest Fe=O bond and forms the strongest FeO&#8722;H bond in the HAT reaction.

         <title>Covalent Cell Surface Conjugation of Nanoparticles by a Combination of Metabolic Labeling and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live cells can be efficiently conjugated with nanoparticles on their surface by two successive biorthogonal click reactions. The 2&#8208;step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of ligand&#8208;decorated nanoparticles, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.







Abstract
Conjugation of nanoparticles (NP) to the surface of living cells is of interest in the context of exploiting the tissue homing properties of ex&#8197;vivo engineered T cells for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of drugs loaded into NP. Cell surface conjugation requires either a covalent or non&#8208;covalent reaction. Non&#8208;covalent conjugation with ligand&#8208;decorated NP (LNP) is challenging and involves a dynamic equilibrium between the bound and unbound state. Covalent NP conjugation results in a permanently bound state of NP, but the current routes for cell surface conjugation face slow reaction kinetics and random conjugation to proteins in the glycocalyx. To address the unmet need for alternative bioorthogonal strategies that allow for efficient covalent cell surface conjugation, we developed a 2&#8208;step click conjugation sequence in which cells are first metabolically labeled with azides followed by reaction with sulfo&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;dibenzyl cyclooctyne (Tz&#8208;DBCO) by SPAAC, and subsequent IEDDA with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) functionalized NP. In contrast to using only metabolic azide labeling and subsequent conjugation of DBCO&#8208;NP, our 2&#8208;step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of LNP, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.

         <title>In situ Construction of Robust Biphasic Surface Layers on Lithium Metal for Lithium&#8211;Sulfide Batteries with Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ construction of robust biphasic surface layers is described through a facile solution pretreatment method with highly polar dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. The method improves the cyclic stability of the lithium electrode significantly and thereby the stability of lithium&#8211;sulfide batteries that contain the electrode.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have potential in high energy density battery systems. However, intermediates of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) can easily shuttle to the Li anode and react with Li metal to deplete the active materials and cause rapid failure of the battery. A facile solution pretreatment method for Li anodes involving a solution of metal fluorides/dimethylsulfoxide was developed to construct robust biphasic surface layers (BSLs) in&#8197;situ. The BSLs consist of lithiophilic alloy (LixM) and LiF phases on Li metal, which inhibit the shuttle effect and increase the cycle life of Li&#8208;S batteries. The BSLs allow Li+ transport and they inhibit dendrite growth and shield the Li anodes from corrosive reaction with LiPSs. Li&#8208;S batteries containing BSLs&#8208;Li anodes demonstrate excellent cycling over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C and simultaneously maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2&#8201;%. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, we propose a strategy for inhibition of the shuttle effect that produces high stability Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of CHF2&#8208;Containing Trisubstituted Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CHieF2 cyclopropanes: A biocatalytic method was developed for the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of CHF2&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes via myoglobin&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer. These biocatalysts offer broad substrate scope, enantiodivergent selectivity and could be applied to produce a difluoromethyl bioisostere of a drug candidate.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl (CHF2) group has attracted significant attention in drug discovery and development efforts, owing to its ability to serve as fluorinated bioisostere of methyl, hydroxyl, and thiol groups. Herein, we report an efficient biocatalytic method for the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of CHF2&#8208;containing trisubstituted cyclopropanes. Using engineered myoglobin catalysts, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl alkenes are cyclopropanated in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate to give CHF2&#8208;containing cyclopropanes in high yield (up to &gt;99&#8201;%, up to 3000&#8197;TON) and with excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% de and ee). Enantiodivergent selectivity and extension of the method to the stereoselective cyclopropanation of mono&#8208; and trifluoromethylated olefins was also achieved. This methodology represents a powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of high&#8208;value fluorinated building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as exemplified by the formal total synthesis of a CHF2 isostere of a TRPV1 inhibitor.

         <title>Iodine Redox Chemistry in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible redox reactions of iodine coupled with various anodes enable the fabrication of advanced rechargeable batteries. This Minireview summarizes the current understanding of the fundamental redox chemistry of iodine, with a special emphasis on the strategies for enhancing battery performance.







Abstract
Halogens have been coupled with metal anodes in a single cell to develop novel rechargeable batteries based on extrinsic redox reactions. Since the commercial introduction of lithium&#8208;iodine batteries in 1972, they have shown great potential to match the high&#8208;rate performance, large energy density, and good safety of advanced batteries. With the development of metal anodes (e.g. Li, Zn), one of the actual challenges lies in the preparation of electrochemically active and reliable iodine&#8208;based cathodes to prevent self&#8208;discharge and capacity decay of the rechargeable batteries. Understanding the fundamental reactions of iodine/polyiodide and their underlying mechanisms is still highly desirable to promote the rational design of advanced cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. In this Minireview, recent advances in the development of iodine&#8208;based cathodes to fabricate rechargeable batteries are summarized, with a special focus on the basic principles of iodine redox chemistry to correlate with structure&#8208;function relationships.

         <title>A Large Starphene Comprising Pentacene Branches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starphenes show promising optoelectronic properties. Notably, HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap presumably decreases with their increasing size, making larger homologues extremely desirable. Unfortunately, with the size, their instability and insolubility also increase, challenging classical synthetic ways. A new method has been developed, enabling synthesis of large starphenes in a quantity sufficient for their full characterisation and further applications.







Abstract
Starphenes are attractive compounds due to their characteristic physicochemical properties that are inherited from acenes, making them interesting compounds for organic electronics and optics. However, the instability and low solubility of larger starphene homologs make their synthesis extremely challenging. Herein, we present a new strategy leading to pristine [16]starphene in preparative scale. Our approach is based on a synthesis of a carbonyl&#8208;protected starphene precursor that is thermally converted in a solid&#8208;state form to the neat [16]starphene, which is then characterised with a variety of analytical methods, such as 13C CP&#8208;MAS NMR, TGA, MS MALDI, UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;resolution STM experiments unambiguously confirm its expected structure and reveal a moderate electronic delocalisation between the pentacene arms. Nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts NICS(1) are also calculated to survey its aromatic character.

         <title>Anionic Bisoxazoline Ligands Enable Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Radical Azidation of Acrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides is reported, in which arrays of acrylamides can be converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, employing a anionic cyano&#8208;bisoxazoline (CN&#8208;Box) ligand is crucial for the generation of a monomeric CuII azide species, rather than a dimeric CuII azide intermediate.







Abstract
Asymmetric radical azidation for the synthesis of chiral alkylazides remains a tremendous challenge in organic synthesis. We report here an unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides catalyzed by 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a copper catalyst. The substrates were converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, employing an anionic cyano&#8208;bisoxazoline (CN&#8208;Box) ligand is crucial to generate a monomeric CuII azide species, rather than a dimeric CuII azide intermediate, for this highly enantioselective radical azidation.

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;Ion Conductivity in Superadamantanoid Lithium Thioborate Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lithium thioborate halides adopt an adamantanoid structure that houses mobile lithium ions within interconnected 3D structural channels and exhibit high ionic conductivities up to 1.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which can be effectively tuned by the polarizability of the halide anion within the channels.







Abstract
Lithium thioborates are promising fast Li&#8208;ion conducting materials, with similar properties to their lithium thiophosphate counterparts that have enabled the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion batteries. By comparison, thioborates have scarcely been developed, however, offering new space for materials discovery. Here we report a new class of lithium thioborate halides that adopt a so&#8208;called supertetrahedral adamantanoid structure that houses mobile lithium ions and halide anions within interconnected 3D structural channels. Investigation of the structure using single&#8208;crystal XRD, neutron powder diffraction, and neutron PDF reveals significant lithium and halide anion disorder. The phases are non&#8208;stoichiometric, adopting slightly varying halide contents within the materials. These new superadamantanoid materials exhibit high ionic conductivities up to 1.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which can be effectively tuned by the polarizability of the halide anion within the channels.

         <title>Side&#8208;on Coordination in Isostructural Nitrous Oxide and Carbon Dioxide Complexes of Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The characterization of &#951;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;N2O and CO2 complexes of nickel and the associated computational study reveal that the bonding ability of N2O to nickel is intermediate between that of CO2 and that of H2C=CH2. It is shown that in general, N2O &#951;2&#8208;binds to metals comparably to or stronger than CO2, indicating that the rarity of &#951;2&#8208;N2O metal complexes is due mostly to its oxidizing character and not to its weak &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties.







Abstract
A nickel complex incorporating an N2O ligand with a rare &#951;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;coordination mode was isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, as well as by IR and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy augmented by 15N&#8208;labeling experiments. The isoelectronic nickel CO2 complex reported for comparison features a very similar solid&#8208;state structure. Computational studies revealed that &#951;2&#8208;N2O binds to nickel slightly stronger than &#951;2&#8208;CO2 in this case, and comparably to or slightly stronger than &#951;2&#8208;CO2 to transition metals in general. Comparable transition&#8208;state energies for the formation of isomeric &#951;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208; and &#951;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;complexes, and a negligible activation barrier for the decomposition of the latter likely account for the limited stability of the N2O complex.

         <title>Unveiling Intrinsic Potassium Storage Behaviors of Hierarchical Nano Bi@N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocages Framework via In Situ Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical nano Bi@N&#8208;doped carbon nanocage framework with an interior void space was smartly fabricated as competitive anode for K&#8208;ion batteries. Its intrinsic potassium storage behaviors are unveiled via comprehensive in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Metallic bismuth has drawn attention as a promising alloying anode for advanced potassium ion batteries (PIBs). However, serious volume expansion/electrode pulverization and sluggish kinetics always lead to its inferior cycling and rate properties for practical applications. Therefore, advanced Bi&#8208;based anodes via structural/compositional optimization and sur&#8208;/interface design are needed. Herein, we develop a bottom&#8208;up avenue to fabricate nanoscale Bi encapsulated in a 3D N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (Bi@N&#8208;CNCs) framework with a void space by using a novel Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework as the precursor. With elaborate regulation in annealing temperatures, the optimized Bi@N&#8208;CNCs electrode exhibits large reversible capacities and long&#8208;duration cyclic stability at high rates when evaluated as competitive anodes for PIBs. Insights into the intrinsic K+&#8208;storage processes of the Bi@N&#8208;CNCs anode are put forward from comprehensive in situ characterizations.

         <title>Design and Applications of a SO2 Surrogate in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Aminosulfonylation between Aryl Iodides and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SO2 surrogate (SOgen) is reported, which is cheap, bench&#8208;stable, and accessible in just two steps from bulk chemicals. SOgen releases SO2 in just a few minutes when heated in the presence of a styrene. The compatibility of this gas&#8208;releasing method with eight previously reported sulfonylation reactions was demonstrated in a two&#8208;chamber system. Direct aminosulfonylation between aryl iodides and amines is reported.







Abstract
A new SO2 surrogate is reported that is cheap, bench&#8208;stable, and can be accessed in just two steps from bulk chemicals. Essentially complete SO2 release is achieved in 5&#8197;minutes. Eight established sulfonylation reactions proceeded smoothly by ex&#8197;situ formation of SO2 by utilizing a two&#8208;chamber system in combination with the SO2 surrogate. Furthermore, we report the first direct aminosulfonylation between aryl iodides and amines. Broad functional group tolerance is demonstrated, and the method is applicable to pharmaceutically relevant substrates, including heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Folding&#8208;upon&#8208;Repair DNA Nanoswitches for Monitoring the Activity of DNA Repair Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanoswitches, named folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches, that upon enzymatic repair could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. The nanoswitches are suitable substrates for different methyltransferases and allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.

We present a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanoswitches that, upon enzymatic repair, could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. Such folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are synthetic DNA sequences containing O6&#8208;methyl&#8208;guanine (O6&#8208;MeG) nucleobases and labelled with a fluorophore/quencher optical pair. The nanoswitches are rationally designed so that only upon enzymatic demethylation of the O6&#8208;MeG nucleobases they can form stable intramolecular Hoogsteen interactions and fold into an optically active triplex DNA structure. We have first characterized the folding mechanism induced by the enzymatic repair activity through fluorescent experiments and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We then demonstrated that the folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are suitable and specific substrates for different methyltransferase enzymes including the human homologue (hMGMT) and they allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.

         <title>A Balance Between Capture and Release: Deciphering the Processes of Nanochaperones Regulate Refolding of Thermally Denatured Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanochaperones have been designed and used for regulating (re)folding of proteins, treating protein misfolding diseases, and drug delivery in recent years. Despite various successes, understanding of the working mechanisms has remained elusive, which is a big challenge to realize their full potential. Here we thoroughly investigated the processes of different charged nanochaperones regulate the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme. We found that the balance between capture and release of lysozyme clients that regulated by nanochaperones play a key role in regulating refolding. More importantly, the findings also worked for other enzymes that with various physiochemical properties. On the basis of these findings, we could recover the activity of enzymes with high efficiency either after storing enzymes at 40 oC for 20 days or heating enzymes at high temperature for 30~60 min. Our results provide importantly additional design strategies of nanochaperone systems to improve their properties and expand their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosafety, Functionalities, and Applications of Biomedical Micro/nanomotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on micro/nanomotors has been booming in the past two decades, and their applications in the biomedical field have also received increasing attention. This Minireview summarizes research progress in the biosafety, functionality, and therapeutic effect of micro/nanomotors that can be used to treat different diseases. The direction of future developments is also discussed.







Abstract
Due to their unique ability to actively move, micro/nanomotors offer the possibility of breaking through the limitations of traditional passive drug delivery systems for the treatment of many diseases, and have attracted the increasing attention of researchers. However, at present, the realization of many advantages of micro/nanomotors in disease treatment in vivo is still in its infancy, because of the complexity and particularity of diseases in different parts of human body. In this Minireview, we first focus on the biosafety and functionality of micro/nanomotors as a biomedical treatment system. Then, we address the treatment difficulties of various diseases in vivo (such as ophthalmic disease, orthopedic disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer), and then review the research progress of biomedical micro/nanomotors in the past 20&#8197;years, Finally, we propose the challenges in this field and possible future development directions

         <title>Enhancing the Sensitivity of Photoelectrochemical DNA Biosensing Using Plasmonic DNA Barcodes and Differential Signal Readout</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A differential signaling strategy allows signal&#8208;off and signal&#8208;on responses measured on a photoelectrochemical biosensor to be combined for enhanced limits of detection, sensitivity, and specificity.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical biosensors hold great promise for sensitive bioanalysis; however, similar to their electrochemical analogues, they are highly affected by the variable backgrounds caused by biological matrices. We developed a new PEC biosensing strategy that uses differential signal generation, combining signals from two separate but correlated binding events on the biosensor, for improving the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection, sensitivity, and specificity of PEC DNA biosensors in biological samples. In this assay, the binding of unlabeled target DNA is followed by the capture of a signal amplification barcode featuring a plasmonic nanoparticle. The interaction of the plasmonic barcode with the semiconductive building blocks of the biosensor results in significant signal amplification, and together with differential signal processing enhances the limit of detection and sensitivity of the assay by up to 15&#8208; and three&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to the previously&#8208;used PEC assays with a single binding event, demonstrating a limit of detection of 3&#8197;fM.

         <dc:description>
A radically new approach to the synthesis of 1&#8208;(dialkylamino)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via addition of diazomethyl radicals to hydrazones is described. This reactivity confirms the utility of the &#945;&#8208;diazosulfonium salts herein introduced as synthetic equivalents of the diazomethyl cation.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of sulfonium salts containing transferable diazomethyl groups is described, and the structure of these compounds is elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Under photochemical conditions, reaction of these salts with N,N&#8208;dialkyl hydrazones affords 1&#8208;(dialkylamino)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via diazomethyl radical addition to the azomethine carbon followed by intramolecular ring closure. The straightforward transformation of the structures thus obtained into mesoionic carbene&#8211;metal complexes is also reported and the donor properties of these new ligands characterized.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Multinuclear Gold Complexes with (Diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene and Oxygen Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compounds [(&#956;&#8208;OH){AuL}2][BF4] and [(&#956;4&#8208;O){AuL}4][BF4] (L=(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene) undergo facile auration at their ferrocene units to produce isomeric tetragold(I) complexes. Conversely, the gold hydroxide [Au(OH)L] rearranges to a unique heptanuclear Au0/AuI cluster [Au7L6]OH. [Au(OH)L] also opens access to Au&#8208;aryl complexes and polynuclear Au complexes with N&#8208;bridging ligands.







Abstract
AuI complexes combining hard oxygen and soft (diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene (L) ligands in their molecules were synthesized, viz. the gold hydroxides [Au(OH)(L&#8208;&#954;P)] (5) and [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}2(&#956;&#8208;OH)][BF4] (4), and the oxonium cluster [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}3(&#956;3&#8208;O)][BF4] (1). In&#8208;situ auration of 1 produced [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}4(&#956;4&#8208;O)][BF4]2 (2), which spontaneously converted into a dimeric tetragold complex featuring bridging phosphanylferrocenyl groups geminally diaurated in position 2 of the ferrocene scaffold. The same complex and its isomer incorporating ferrocene&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;diyl bridges resulted similarly from 4. Upon crystallization, compound 5 underwent a redox reaction, producing a structurally unique, crown&#8208;like, mixed&#8208;valent Au0/AuI cluster, [Au7(L&#8208;&#954;P)6]OH. Compounds 1 and 5 were used to prepare the analogous, N&#8208;bridged complexes, [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}3(&#956;3&#8208;NFc)][BF4] (Fc=ferrocenyl) and [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}4(&#956;4&#8208;N)][BF4]. The compounds were structurally characterized and further studied by DFT calculations.

In&#8208;situ auration of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; produced [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;O)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), which spontaneously converted into a dimeric tetragold complex featuring bridging phosphanylferrocenyl groups geminally diaurated in position 2 of the ferrocene scaffold. The same complex and its isomer incorporating ferrocene&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;diyl bridges resulted similarly from &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. Upon crystallization, compound &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; underwent a redox reaction, producing a structurally unique, crown&#8208;like, mixed&#8208;valent Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cluster, [Au&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]OH. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; were used to prepare the analogous, N&#8208;bridged complexes, [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;NFc)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (Fc=ferrocenyl) and [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;N)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. The compounds were structurally characterized and further studied by DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlling the Stacking Modes of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets through Host&#8211;Guest Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest noncovalent strategy was proposed to tune the stacking modes of metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets for isomer separation. Solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets, while the alkanes from C6 to C14 were likely to vertically enter the pores of nanosheets, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets as efficient isomer separator.







Abstract
The tuning of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet stacking modes from molecular level was rarely explored although it significantly affected the properties and applications of nanosheets. Here, the different stacking modes of Zr&#8208;1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene framework nanosheets were synthesized through the induction of different host&#8211;guest noncovalent interactions. The solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets with the specific rotation angles of 12&#176;, 18&#176;, 24&#176; and 6&#176;, 18&#176;, 24&#176;, 30&#176;, respectively, which was in agreement with theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the alkanes were likely to vertically enter the pores of Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets because of steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets. The untwisted ordered nanopores showed the excellent gas chromatographic separations of benzene derivative isomers, which was better than twisted nanosheets stacking and commercial columns. This work uncovers a rational strategy to control the stacking of two&#8208;dimensional MOF nanosheets.

         <title>Assembly of &#945;&#8208;(Hetero)aryl Nitriles via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed formation of &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl nitriles from (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with a broad reaction scope by using two pyridine&#8208;embodied oxalamide ligands.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;(Hetero)aryl nitriles are important structural motifs for pharmaceutical design. The known methods for direct synthesis of these compounds via coupling with (hetero)aryl halides suffer from narrow reaction scope. Herein, we report that the combination of copper salts and oxalic diamides enables the coupling of a variety of (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br) and ethyl cyanoacetate under mild conditions, affording &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylacetonitriles via one&#8208;pot decarboxylation. Additionally, the CuBr/oxalic diamide catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted ethyl cyanoacetates proceeds smoothly at 60&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the formation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl (hetero)arylacetonitriles after decarboxylation. The method features a general substrate scope and is compatible with various functionalities and heteroaryls.

         <title>A Large Starphene Comprising Pentacene Branches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red star is born: A new route to prepare large and insoluble molecular starphenes by decarbonylation of soluble precursors in the solid state is described in the Research Article by Andrej Jancarik, Andre Gourdon et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016163). Scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy in ultra&#8208;high vacuum and absorption spectroscopy in frozen matrices, with both experiments run at liquid helium temperature, show that the electronic delocalization among the three pentacene branches is rather limited.

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delicate control of the shell structure of hollow spheres leads to enhanced mass transport, as described by Dan Wang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016285). The prepared hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) with close duplicated shells (yellow) and bubble&#8208;like shells (green) can promote the gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure and accelerate liquid transfer for the enhanced capillary force compared to the HoMSs with non&#8208;duplicated solid shells (red), thus exhibiting superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Rational Design of Nanogels for Overcoming the Biological Barriers in Various Administration Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines and summarizes the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the complex biological barriers on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.







Abstract
Nanogels have been identified as outstanding nanocarrier candidates for drug delivery due to their desirable physiochemical properties and versatile applicability for diverse therapeutic molecules and imaging probes. One of the main challenges that hinder the clinical translation of nanogels is the low efficiency of drug delivery to the target sites because of the complex biological barriers during the in&#8197;vivo journey. The purpose of this review is to examine and summarize the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the barriers and challenges on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In particular, the functional moieties or domains have been incorporated in the nanogels, allowing them to spontaneously regulate their structure and physiochemical properties to cross one or more of the multifaceted barriers. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.

         <title>Host&#8208;guest Interaction Modulation in Porous Coordination Polymers for Inverse Selective CO2/C2H2 separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling gas sorption by simple pore modification is important in molecular recognition and industrial separation processes. In particular, it is challenging to realize the inverse selectivity, which reduces the adsorption of a high&#8208;affinity gas and increases the adsorption of a low&#8208;affinity gas. Herein, an &#8220;opposite action&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for boosting CO2/C2H2  selectivity in porous coordination polymers (PCPs). A precise steric design of channel pores using an amino group as an additional interacting site enabled the synergetic increase in CO2  adsorption while suppressing the C2H2  adsorption. Based on this strategy, two new ultramicroporous PCP physisorbents that are isostructural were synthesised. They exhibited the highest CO2  uptake and CO2/C2H2  volume uptake ratio at 298 K. Origin of this specific selectivity was verified by detailed density functional theory calculations. The breakthrough separation performances with remarkable stability and recyclability of both the PCPs render them relevant materials for C2H2  purification from CO2/C2H2  mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Dibenzopentalene&#8208;based Conjugated Nanohoops through Stereoselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated nanohoops allow to investigate the effect of radial conjugation and bending on the &#960;&#8208;systems involved. Such hoops can possess unexpected optoelectronic properties and their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;system makes them attractive for host&#8208;guest chemistry. With the right choice of &#960;&#8208;subsystem, bending it out of planarity can induce chirality in the hoop. Here we report the stereoselective synthesis of two enantiomers of chiral conjugated nanohoops by incorporating dibenzo[a,e]pentalenes (DBPs), which are generated in the last synthetic step from enantiomerically pure diketone precursor units. Due to its bent shape, both enantiomers of this diketone unit were used as the only bent precursors in the synthesis of the hoops, making it an attractive &#8220;corner unit&#8221; for nanohoop synthesis. The [6]DBP[4]Ph&#8208;hoops reported herein contain six DBP units and four bridging phenylene groups and are only the second report of nanohoops incorporating antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems. The small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and ambipolar electrochemical character of the DBP units is reflected in the optoelectronic properties of the hoop. Electronic circular dichroism spectra and MD simulations showed that &#8211; inspite of its conformational flexibility regarding the outer shape &#8211; the chiral hoop did not racemize even when heated to 110&#160;&#176;C. Due to its large diameter, the [6]DBP[4]Ph&#8208;hoop was able to accommodate two C60 molecules, as binding studies indicate.</dc:description>

         <title>Low power, low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma&#8208;induced polymerization: facile synthesis and crystal regulation of covalent organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma&#8208;induced polymerization was demonstrated as a fast and facile strategy for tailoring of packing phase of COF&#8208;1 as well as preparing diverse covalent organic frameworks (COFs) including both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs. By regulating the solvents, the fast construction of well&#8208;ordered AB staggered COF&#8208;1 and AA eclipsed COF&#8208;1 was facilely realized in minutes. The plasma approach presented here led to the rapid preparation of eight classical 2D COFs, including boronate ester&#8208;linkage (COF&#8208;5, COF&#8208;8 and COF&#8208;10), azine&#8208;linkage (NUS&#8208;2), &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linkage (TpPa, TPBD), imine&#8208;linkage (ILCOF&#8208;1, Py&#8208;COF), and 3D&#8208;COF&#8208;102 (boroxine linkage) in less than 1 hour. Different from conventional methods, the proposed methodology required much less time, lower power, no extra heating, inert&#8208;gas protection and pressure. The fast nucleation and growth of COFs with good crystallinity, morphology and thermal stability can be achieved under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective and Stereospecific Triflate Mediated Intramolecular Schmidt Reaction: Easy Access to Alkaloid Skeletons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselectivity and stereospecificity of the triflate mediated intramolecular Schmidt reaction of substituted 3&#8208;(1&#8208;azidocyclohexyl)propanol derivatives leading to octahydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]azepine, the structural skeleton of several important families of alkaloids such as the  Stemona  alkaloids, has been examined. The reaction involves an initial intramolecular S  N  2 reaction between the azide moiety and the triflate affording an intermediate spirocyclic aminodiazonoium salt that undergoes the expected 1,2&#8208;shift/N  2  &#8208;elimination followed by hydride mediated iminium salt reduction. Remarkably, chiral alcohols are converted to the azabicylic derivative with no or limited racemization. The initial asymmetric alcohol center controls the diastereoselectivity of the whole process leading to the formation of one out of the four possible diastereoisomers of disubstituted octahydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]azepine. The origin of the stereoselectivity is rationalized based on theoretical calculations. The concise synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;(  cis  )&#8208;3&#8208;propylindolizidine and (&#8211;)&#8208;(  cis  )&#8208;3&#8208;butyllehmizidine, two alkaloids found in the venom of workers of the ant  Myrmicaria melanogaster  , is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Boric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a long time, phosphors with long&#8208;lived emission are dominated by rare earth/transition metal ion&#8208;doped sulfides and oxides. Recently, organic materials capable of emitting long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are reported, carbon skeletons are almost the exclusive structural feature of the conjugated luminophores. Herein, we reported that boric acid, a non&#8208;metal and C&#8208;free material, could emit RTP with lifetime up to 0.3 s. Detailed investigations indicated the weak conjugation between the  n  electrons of the O atoms in the B&#8208;O confined space was the possible origin of RTP. Similar RTP was also found in electron&#8208;rich N/F systems, namely, BN and BF  3  (BF  4  &#8208;  ). Importantly, the vacant [[EQUATION]] orbital of B was found to contribute to the relevant unoccupied molecular orbitals involved in excitation, which is different from previous reports on phosphorescence from arylboronic acids. The results confirm the unique role of B as a versatile structure motif for construction of new RTP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent black phosphorus/metal&#8208;organic framework hetero&#8208;nanostructure for high&#8208;performance flexible supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical methodologies that enable the controllable fabrication of covalent bond&#8208;bridged anisotropic nanomaterials with architected microchannels and electroactivities for fast dynamic migration and storage of ions has led to the evolution of high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Here, we develop the hetero&#8208;nanostructured black phosphorus/metal&#8208;organic framework hybrids formed by P&#8208;O&#8208;Co covalent bonding based on a designed droplet microfluidic strategy consisting of &#160;confined and ultrafast microdroplet reactions. The resulting hybrid exhibits large capacitance (1347 F g  &#8208;1  ) in KOH electrolytes due to its&#160; large specific&#8208;surface&#8208;area (632.47 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;porosity (0.38 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  ), and engineered electroactivity. Furthermore, the proposed 3D printing method allows to construct all&#8208;integrated solid&#8208;state supercapacitor, which maintains interconnected porous network, good interfacial adhesion, and robust flexibility for short&#8208;path diffusion and excessive accommodation of ions. Consequently, the fabricated flexible supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 109.8 mWh cm  &#8208;3  , large capacitance of 506 F cm  &#8208;3  , and good long&#8208;term stability of 12000 cycles  .</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Stabilized Droplet Templating towards Tunable Hierarchical Porosity in Single Crystalline Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  3   for Enhanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  3  (NVP) is regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, whereas, its performance is usually limited by the inherent low electronic conductivity and dense bulk structure. Herein, we develop a facile polymer stabilized droplet template strategy to synthesize porous single crystal structured NVP. The pore structures (macrostructures, hierarchically meso/macrostructures, and mesostructures), pore sizes (5 ~ 2000 nm), and specific surface areas (26 ~ 158 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ) of the samples can be readily controlled by tuning the sizes of droplet templates. The resultant hierarchically meso/macropores NVP demonstrates superior sodium storage performances, because its porous single crystal structure owns solid&#8208;liquid Na  +  transmission mode, shortens ion diffusion distance and provides large electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact area, greatly facilitating fast ionic transport. We believe the presented method will supply a novel avenue to prepare porous single crystal structured materials for anticipative applications.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF Nanosheet Reconstructed Two&#8208;dimensional Bionic Nanochannel for Protonic Field&#8208;effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of hydrophobic nanochannel with hydrophilic sites for bionic devices to proximally mimick real bio&#8208;system is still challenging. Taking the advantages of MOF chemistry, a highly oriented CuTCPP thin film has been successfully reconstructed with ultra&#8208;thin nanosheets to produce abundant two&#8208;dimensional interstitial hydro&#8208;phobic nanochannels with hydrophilic sites. Different from the classical active&#8208;layer material with proton transport in bulk, CuTCPP thin film represents a new type of active&#8208;layer with proton transport in nanochannel for bionic proton field&#8208;effect transistor (H +  &#8208;FETs). The resultant device can reversibly modulate the proton transport by varying the voltage on its gate electrode. Meanwhile, it shows the highest proton mobility of ~9.5 &#215; 10 &#8208;3  cm 2  V &#8208;1  s &#8208;1  and highest on&#8208;off ratio of 4.1 among all of the reported H +  &#8208;FETs. Our result demonstrates a powerful material design strategy for proximally mimicking the structure and properties of bio&#8208;systems and constructing bionic electrical devices.</dc:description>

An effective and versatile strategy to construct mesoporous ABO3 perovskite oxides via a resol&#8208;assisted cationic coordinative co&#8208;assembly approach is developed. The as&#8208;prepared mesoporous LaMnO3 with functionalized nanocrystal frameworks and abundant oxygen vacancy sites as catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and stability for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.







Abstract
It is a challenge to obtain ABO3 perovskite oxides with favorable crystal phase and well&#8208;defined porous structure via existing approaches. Here, we design an effective and versatile strategy to construct mesoporous ABO3 perovskite oxides with functionalized nanocrystal frameworks and abundant oxygen vacancy sites via a resol&#8208;assisted cationic coordinative co&#8208;assembly approach. The as&#8208;prepared oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich mesoporous LaMnO3 as heterogeneous catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and stability for hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, including over 99&#8201;% conversion and 96&#8201;% selectivity. Combined with density functional theory calculation, the catalytic mechanism is elucidated, revealing that porous LaMnO3 nanocrystal framework is conducive to expose oxygen deficiency sites, which can facilitate the interaction between catalyst surface and catalytic substrate, leading to lower barrier in hydrogenation process.

         <title>Designable Al32&#8208;Oxo Clusters with Hydrotalcite&#8208;like Structures: Snapshots of Boundary Hydrolysis and Optical Limiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4849-4854, February 23, 2021. </description>

A series of Al32&#8208;oxo clusters with hydrotalcite&#8208;like cores and &#960;&#8208;conjugated shells were isolated, which are unique models of two&#8208;dimensional or layered materials and may be used to study boundary activity and optical limiting properties.







Abstract
The hydrolysis of earth&#8208;abundant AlIII has implications in mineral mimicry, geochemistry and environmental chemistry. Third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are important in modern chemistry due to their extensive optical applications. The assembly of AlIII ions with &#960;&#8208;conjugated carboxylate ligands is carried out and the hydrolysis and NLO properties of the resultant material are studied. A series of Al32&#8208;oxo clusters with hydrotalcite&#8208;like cores and &#960;&#8208;conjugated shells are isolated. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed boundary hydrolysis occurs at the equatorially unsaturated coordination sites of AlIII ions. Charge distribution analysis and DFT calculations support the proposed boundary substitution. The Al32&#8208;oxo clusters possess a significant reverse saturable absorption (RSA) response with a minimal normalized transmittance up to 29&#8201;%, indicating they are suitable candidates for optical limiting (OL) materials. This work elucidates the hydrolysis of AlIII and provides insight into layered materials that also have strong boundary activity at the edges or corners.

         <title>Mg&#8208;Pillared LiCoO2: Towards Stable Cycling at 4.6&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4682-4688, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The endeavor to deliver a high specific capacity for a LiCoO2 cathode at a voltage larger than 4.35&#8197;V is challenging. The deliberately introduced Mg ions at the Li layer of LiCoO2 endow this promising cathode with high capacity (204&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability and rate capability within a voltage window of 3.0&#8211;4.6&#8197;V.







Abstract
LiCoO2 is used as a cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, however, cationic/anodic&#8208;redox&#8208;induced unstable phase transitions, oxygen escape, and side reactions with electrolytes always occur when charging LiCoO2 to voltages higher than 4.35&#8197;V, resulting in severe capacity fade. Reported here is Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2. Dopant Mg ions, serving as pillars in the Li&#8208;slab of LiCoO2, prevent slab sliding in a delithiated state, thereby suppressing unfavorable phase transitions. Moreover, the resulting Li&#8208;Mg mixing structure at the surface of Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2 is beneficial for eliminating the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase overgrowth and phase transformation in the close&#8208;to&#8208;surface region. Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2 exhibits a high capacity of 204&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and an enhanced capacity retention of 84&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C over 100&#8197;cycles within the voltage window of 3.0&#8211;4.6&#8197;V. In contrast, pristine LiCoO2 has a capacity retention of 14&#8201;% within the same voltage window.

         <title>Assembly of The Mitochondrial Complex&#8197;I Assembly Complex Suggests a Regulatory Role for Deflavination</title>

Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are key mitochondrial pathways for cellular energetics. However, the crosstalk between them is unclear. We show that the molecular architecture of the mitochondrial Complex&#8197;I assembly (MCIA) complex, required for Complex&#8197;I biogenesis and thereby for activation of OXPHOS, implies an allosteric deflavination mechanism that shuts down FAO.







Abstract
Fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are mitochondrial redox processes that generate ATP. The biogenesis of the respiratory Complex I, a 1&#8197;MDa multiprotein complex that is responsible for initiating OXPHOS, is mediated by assembly factors including the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. However, the organisation and the role of the MCIA complex are still unclear. Here we show that ECSIT functions as the bridging node of the MCIA core complex. Furthermore, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy together with biochemical and biophysical experiments reveal that the C&#8208;terminal domain of ECSIT directly binds to the vestigial dehydrogenase domain of the FAO enzyme ACAD9 and induces its deflavination, switching ACAD9 from its role in FAO to an MCIA factor. These findings provide the structural basis for the MCIA complex architecture and suggest a unique molecular mechanism for coordinating the regulation of the FAO and OXPHOS pathways to ensure an efficient energy production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Propelled Lanbiotic Based Janus Micromotors for Selective Inactivation of Bacterial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4915-4924, February 23, 2021. </description>

Catalytic and magnetic Janus micromotors based on 2D graphene are combined here with the lanbiotic Nisin for highly efficient capture/killing of Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria and biofilms. The strategy opens new avenues to nanoengineer micromotors with antimicrobial peptides for effective treatment of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
Graphene oxide/PtNPs/Fe2O3 &#8220;dual&#8208;propelled&#8221; catalytic and fuel&#8208;free rotary actuated magnetic Janus micromotors modified with the lanbiotic Nisin are used for highly selective capture/inactivation of gram&#8208;positive bacteria units and biofilms. Specific interaction of Nisin with the Lipid II unit of Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria in connection with the enhanced micromotor movement and generated fluid flow result in a 2&#8208;fold increase of the capture/killing ability (both in bubble and magnetic propulsion modes) as compared with free peptide and static counterparts. The high stability of Nisin along with the high towing force of the micromotors allow for efficient operation in untreated raw media (tap water, juice and serum) and even in blood and in flowing blood in magnetic mode. The high selectivity of the approach is illustrated by the dramatically lower interaction with gram&#8208;negative bacteria (Escherichia Coli). The double&#8208;propulsion (catalytic or fuel&#8208;free magnetic) mode of the micromotors and the high biocompatibility holds considerable promise to design micromotors with tailored lanbiotics that can response to the changes that make the bacteria resistant in a myriad of clinical, environmental remediation or food safety applications.

         <title>Molecular Cages Self&#8208;Assembled by Imine Condensation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4705-4711, February 23, 2021. </description>

By taking advantage of multivalence and ligand preorganization, a series of basket&#8208;shaped cages are self&#8208;assembled by imine condensation in water. These cages are rather stable and inert against hydrolysis, and therefore they are able to take advantage of the hydrophobic effect for guest recognition.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly by imine condensation in aqueous media is a formidable task because of the labile nature of imines in the presence of water. Here, by taking advantage of multivalence and ligand preorganization, basket&#8208;shaped triscationic cage molecules are self&#8208;assembled in high yields in both water and organic solvent, by condensing a hexaformyl and bisamine. These cages, especially the chiral ones, are stable or inert in aqueous solution, that is, no decomposition was observed upon dilution, precipitation, or exposure to competitive amines or aldehydes. Such water&#8208;compatibility allows the hosts to take advantage of the hydrophobic effect to accommodate hydrophobic guests. The chiral cage S&#8208;23+ selectively binds and distinguishes one of two enantiomers, opening up opportunities for applications such as chiral compound separation. Chiral narcissistic self&#8208;sorting and sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers effects occur during cage formation when two amino precursors are involved in self&#8208;assembly.

Natural product (NP) fragments are combined in unprecedented arrangements to deliver a 155&#8208;member pseudo&#8208;NP collection. Cheminformatic analysis and biological evaluation of the collection by means of phenotyping in the morphological cell painting assay and principal component analysis revealed that the pseudo&#8208;NP classes are chemically diverse with markedly different bioactivity patterns, which are dependent on connectivity and regioisomeric arrangement of the fragments.







Abstract
Natural product (NP) structures are a rich source of inspiration for the discovery of new biologically relevant chemical matter. In natural product inspired pseudo&#8208;NPs, NP&#8208;derived fragments are combined de novo in unprecedented arrangements. Described here is the design and synthesis of a 155&#8208;member pyrroquinoline pseudo&#8208;NP collection in which fragments characteristic of the tetrahydroquinoline and pyrrolidine NP classes are combined with eight different connectivities and regioisomeric arrangements. Cheminformatic analysis and biological evaluation of the compound collection by means of phenotyping in the morphological &#8220;cell painting&#8221; assay followed by principal component analysis revealed that the pseudo&#8208;NP classes are chemically diverse and that bioactivity patterns differ markedly, and are dependent on connectivity and regioisomeric arrangement of the fragments.

         <title>Photoacoustic Cavitation&#8208;Ignited Reactive Oxygen Species to Amplify Peroxynitrite Burst by Photosensitization&#8208;Free Polymeric Nanocapsules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4720-4731, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitization&#8208;free polymeric nanocapsules are activated by photoacoustic cavitation via pulsed laser irradiation to generate distinct reactive oxygen species, which spontaneously react with in situ released nitric oxide to burst highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite, achieving prominent therapeutic efficacy. This work provides a promising modality for precision disease theranostics via extensive photosensitization&#8208;free materials.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) technology can transform light energy into acoustic wave, which can be used for either imaging or therapy that depends on the power density of pulsed laser. Here, we report photosensitizer&#8208;free polymeric nanocapsules loaded with nitric oxide (NO) donors, namely NO&#8208;NCPs, formulated from NIR light&#8208;absorbable amphiphilic polymers and a NO&#8208;releasing donor, DETA NONOate. Controlled NO release and nanocapsule dissociation are achieved in acidic lysosomes of cancer cells. More importantly, upon pulsed laser irradiation, the PA cavitation can excite water to generate significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical (O2.&#8722;), which further spontaneously reacts with the in situ released NO to burst highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in cancer cells. The resultant ONOO&#8722; generation greatly promotes mitochondrial damage and DNA fragmentation to initiate programmed cancer cell death. Apart from PA imaging, PA cavitation can intrinsically amplify reactive species via photosensitization&#8208;free materials for promising disease theranostics.

         <title>Strategies for Mitigating Dissolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphases in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4855-4863, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and dissolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in sodium&#8208;based systems is studied using a new cell setup. As a separator, &#946;&#8208;alumina is employed as a sodium&#8208;conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working electrode and sodium&#8208;metal counter electrode. The SEI dissolution in different time domains is tested and mitigated with new additive strategies. A correlation between SEI dissolution and SEI chemistry is presented.







Abstract
The interfacial reactions in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are not well understood yet. The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in SIBs is still challenging due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to lithium analogues. This study therefore aims to shed light on the dissolution of SEI influenced by the electrolyte chemistry. By conducting electrochemical tests with extended open circuit pauses, and using surface spectroscopy, we determine the extent of self&#8208;discharge due to SEI dissolution. Instead of using a conventional separator, &#946;&#8208;alumina was used as sodium&#8208;conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working and sodium&#8208;metal counter electrode. The relative capacity loss after a pause of 50&#8197;hours in the tested electrolyte systems ranges up to 30&#8201;%. The solubility of typical inorganic SEI species like NaF and Na2CO3 was determined. The electrolytes were then saturated by those SEI species in order to oppose ageing due to the dissolution of the SEI.

Amine&#8208;rich biomolecules as consumed coreactants drive electrochemiluminescence with Ru(bpy)32+, enabling bio&#8208;coreactant&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;cell electrochemiluminescence microscopy. This allows the imaging of intracellular hierarchical structures without the use of multiple labels. Dynamic signals disclose the universal edge effect of cellular electroporation and enable the visualization of heterogeneous molecular transport.







Abstract
A bio&#8208;coreactant&#8208;enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy realizes the ECL imaging of intracellular structure and dynamic transport. This microscopy uses Ru(bpy)32+ as the electrochemical molecular antenna connecting extracellular and intracellular environments, and uses intracellular biomolecules as the coreactants of ECL reactions via a &#8220;catalytic route&#8221;. Accordingly, intracellular structures are identified without using multiple labels, and autophagy involving DNA oxidative damage is detected using nuclear ECL signals. A time&#8208;resolved image sequence discloses the universal edge effect of cellular electroporation due to the influence of the geometric properties of cell membranes on the induced transmembrane voltage. The dynamic transport of Ru(bpy)33+ in the different cellular compartments unveils the heterogeneous intracellular diffusivity correlating with the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to single&#8208;cell studies, the bio&#8208;coreactant&#8208;enhanced ECL microscopy is used to image a slice of a mouse liver and a colony of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regeneration and Self&#8208;Healing in DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>

Self&#8208;assembly and reconfigurability of DNA origami is exploited to realize self&#8208;repairing functional nanodevices. A self&#8208;regenerating brightness label is realized by constant exchange of labeling strands from solution. Structural self&#8208;healing of a DNA origami nanoruler is achieved by excess of staple strands that exchange with enzymatically or photo&#8208;induced damaged strands.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology and advances in the DNA origami technique have enabled facile design and synthesis of complex and functional nanostructures. Molecular devices are, however, prone to rapid functional and structural degradation due to the high proportion of surface atoms at the nanoscale and due to complex working environments. Besides stabilizing mechanisms, approaches for the self&#8208;repair of functional molecular devices are desirable. Here we exploit the self&#8208;assembly and reconfigurability of DNA origami nanostructures to induce the self&#8208;repair of defects of photoinduced and enzymatic damage. We provide examples of repair in DNA nanostructures showing the difference between unspecific self&#8208;regeneration and damage specific self&#8208;healing mechanisms. Using DNA origami nanorulers studied by atomic force and superresolution DNA PAINT microscopy, quantitative preservation of fluorescence properties is demonstrated with direct potential for improving nanoscale calibration samples.

         <title>Capturing Manganese Oxide Intermediates in Electrochemical Water Oxidation at Neutral pH by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct capture of an intermediate species on the surface of manganese oxide nanoparticles was achieved in electrochemical water oxidation and visualized using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A Raman band position at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 combined with isotope&#8208;labeling experiments using H218O and D2O confirmed the generation of the surface terminal MnIV=O species, which is the water oxidation intermediate for the oxygen evolution reaction. Key: rate&#8208;determining step (RDS).







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising means to produce eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen fuels. Inspired by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in nature, substantial works have been performed to develop efficient manganese (Mn)&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts. Despite improvements in catalytic activity, the underlying mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is not completely elucidated owing to the lack of direct spectroscopic evidence for the active Mn&#8208;oxo moieties. We identify water oxidation intermediates on the surface of Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) in the OER at neutral pH by in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A potential&#8208;dependent Raman peak was detected at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and assigned to the active MnIV=O species generated during water oxidation. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments combined with scavenger experiments confirmed the generation of surface terminal MnIV=O intermediates in the Mn&#8208;oxide NPs. This study provides an insight into the design of systems for the observation of reaction intermediates.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Dichotomic Borylation of Alkyne Carbonates: Stereoselective Access to (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diborylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes versus Traceless Monoborylation Affording &#945;&#8208;Hydroxyallenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4901-4906, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild copper&#8208;mediated protocol has been developed that allows for dichotomic borylation of alkynyl&#8208;substituted carbonates, affording either 1,2&#8208;diborylated 1,3&#8208;dienes or &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allenes as the principal products, depending on the nature of the diboron(4) reagent. A mechanistic rationale is presented that reveals the crucial role of the relative kinetics of the second borylation step versus i&#8208;PrOH&#8208;assisted protodemetalation.







Abstract
A mild copper&#8208;mediated protocol has been developed for borylation of alkynyl cyclic carbonates. Depending on the nature of the borylating reaction partner, either stereoselective diborylation of the propargylic surrogate takes place, providing convenient access to (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;borylated 1,3&#8208;dienes, or traceless monoborylation occurs, which leads to &#945;&#8208;hydroxyallenes as the principal product. The dichotomy in this borylation protocol has been scrutinized by several control experiments, illustrating that a relatively small change in the diboron(4) reagent allows for competitive alcohol&#8208;assisted protodemetalation to forge an &#945;&#8208;hydroxyallene product under ambient conditions.

A mechanistic rationale is presented that reveals the crucial role of the relative kinetics of the second borylation step versus &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;PrOH&#8208;assisted protodemetalation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild copper&#8208;mediated protocol has been developed for borylation of alkynyl cyclic carbonates. Depending on the nature of the borylating reaction partner, either stereoselective diborylation of the propargylic surrogate takes place, providing convenient access to (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;1,2&#8208;borylated 1,3&#8208;dienes, or traceless monoborylation occurs, which leads to &#945;&#8208;hydroxyallenes as the principal product. The dichotomy in this borylation protocol has been scrutinized by several control experiments, illustrating that a relatively small change in the diboron(4) reagent allows for competitive alcohol&#8208;assisted protodemetalation to forge an &#945;&#8208;hydroxyallene product under ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Electron Transfer Process in Mixed Valence Compounds with a Low&#8208;lying Energy Bridge in Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4804-4814, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the R+&#8208;B&#8208;R (R is the redox center and B is the bridging ligand) mixed&#8208;valence system with a low&#8208;lying energy bridge, the energy difference (&#916;G0) between the bridge state (R&#8208;B+&#8208;R) and mixed&#8208;valence states (R+&#8208;B&#8208;R or R&#8208;B&#8208;R+) could be effectively tuned and even become zero by the fine modification of donor substitution.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;valence compounds with the iso&#8208;cyanidometal&#8208;ligand bridge in different oxidation states are used as models for the investigation of the electron&#8208;transfer process. We synthesized a series of trimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with [Fe&#8211;CN&#8211;Ru&#8211;NC&#8211;Fe]n+ (n=2&#8211;4), in which the one&#8208;electron oxidation product (N3+) and two&#8208;electron oxidation product (N4+) compounds possess an isocyanidometal bridge whose energy is, respectively lower and slightly higher than the terminal metal centers energies. For the N3+ compounds, the bridge state (FeII&#8211;RuIII&#8211;FeII) and mixed&#8208;valence states (FeIII&#8211;RuII&#8211;FeII or FeII&#8211;RuII&#8211;FeIII) could be simultaneously observed on the IR timescale. For the N4+ compounds, as the donor becomes stronger the electron transfer bridge excited state (FeIII&#8211;RuII&#8211;FeIII) becomes more and more stable, and even becomes ground state due to the strong electronic coupling between Fe and Ru.

         <title>Observing Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Sites During Reactions with Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4764-4773, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Observing single&#8208;atom catalytic sites during reactions: Single&#8208;atom catalysts supported on soluble polyoxometalates have been investigated under reaction conditions by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This enables us to observe the exact composition and stoichiometry of active sites as well as their dynamics during CO and alcohol oxidation reactions. Even the apparent activation barriers between intermediates become accessible.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have become a prominent theme in heterogeneous catalysis, not least because of the potential fundamental insight into active sites. The desired level of understanding, however, is prohibited due to the inhomogeneity of most supported SACs and the lack of suitable tools for structure&#8211;activity correlation studies with atomic resolution. Herein, we describe the potency of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) to study molecularly defined SACs supported on polyoxometalates in catalytic reactions. We identified the exact composition of active sites and their evolution in the catalytic cycle during CO and alcohol oxidation reactions performed in the liquid phase. Critical information on metal&#8208;dependent reaction mechanisms, the key intermediates, the dynamics of active sites and even the stepwise activation barriers were obtained, which would be challenging to gather via prevailingly adopted techniques in SAC research. DFT calculations revealed intricate details of the reaction mechanisms, and strong synergies between ESI&#8208;MS defined SAC sites and electronic structure theory calculations become apparent.

         <title>Ultrathin Porous Carbon Nitride Bundles with an Adjustable Energy Band Structure toward Simultaneous Solar Photocatalytic Water Splitting and Selective Phenylcarbinol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4815-4822, February 23, 2021. </description>

Ultrathin porous carbon nitride bundles were designed based on the pyrolysis of asymmetric supramolecular precursor from L&#8208;arginine and melamine. It has a high specific surface area and adjustable band gap. Through the coupling of water&#8208;splitting and phenylcarbinol oxidation, the efficiency of hydrogen evolution was promoted and phenylcarbinol oxidation was activated.







Abstract
Actiniae&#8208;like carbon nitride (ACN) bundles were synthesized by the pyrolysis of an asymmetric supramolecular precursor prepared from L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;Arg) and melamine. ACN has adjustable band gaps (2.25&#8197;eV&#8211;2.75&#8197;eV) and hollow microtubes with ultrathin pore walls, which enrich reaction sites, improve visible&#8208;light absorption and enhance charge separation. In the presence of phenylcarbinol, ACN exhibited excellent water&#8208;splitting ability (95.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and in the meanwhile phenylcarbinol was selectively oxidized to benzaldehyde (conversion of 90.9&#8201;%, selectivity of 99.7&#8201;%) under solar irradiation. For the concurrent reactions, 2D isotope labeling, separation, and detection were conducted to confirm that the proton source of released hydrogen is water. The mechanism of water splitting and phenylcarbinol oxidation was also investigated.

         <title>London Dispersion Interactions Rather than Steric Hindrance Determine the Enantioselectivity of the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata Reduction</title>

London dispersion (LD) interactions facilitate the enantioselectivity in the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata (CBS) reduction. Employing a combination of computational and experimental studies, we provide a modern view on the origin of enantioselectivity in this powerful organocatalyzed reaction. The results demonstrate that attractive LD interactions between the catalyst and the substrate rather than steric repulsion determine the selectivity.







Abstract
The well&#8208;known Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata (CBS) reduction is a powerful method for the asymmetric synthesis of alcohols from prochiral ketones, often featuring high yields and excellent selectivities. While steric repulsion has been regarded as the key director of the observed high enantioselectivity for many years, we show that London dispersion (LD) interactions are at least as important for enantiodiscrimination. We exemplify this through a combination of detailed computational and experimental studies for a series of modified CBS catalysts equipped with dispersion energy donors (DEDs) in the catalysts and the substrates. Our results demonstrate that attractive LD interactions between the catalyst and the substrate, rather than steric repulsion, determine the selectivity. As a key outcome of our study, we were able to improve the catalyst design for some challenging CBS reductions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled Enantioconvergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives via Synergistic Br&#248;nsted Acid/Photoredox Catalysis</title>

A radical addition reaction between glycine esters and racemic &#945;&#8208;bromoketones catalyzed by synergistic Br&#248;nsted acid/photoredox catalysis is presented. This dual catalysis controls the reactive radical intermediate and iminium ion to facilitate the bond&#8208;forming event in a highly stereochemical manner. An array of valuable enantioenriched unnatural &#945;&#8208;AAs bearing two contiguous stereocenters are accessible.







Abstract
An unprecedented radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction was achieved between glycine esters and racemic &#945;&#8208;bromoketones catalyzed by synergistic Br&#248;nsted acid/photoredox catalysis, thus serving as an efficient platform for the synthesis of highly valuable enantioenriched unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives. This dual catalysis provides a powerful capability to control the reactive radical intermediate and iminium ion, thereby enabling enantioconvergent bond&#8208;formation in a highly stereochemical manner. An array of valuable enantioenriched unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers are readily accessible with high diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity, which include &#945;&#8208;amino acids with a unique &#946;&#8208;fluorinated quaternary stereocenter or its &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon counterpart. A strong chiral amplification effect was observed in this dual catalytic system.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation by an Iron&#8208;Nitrido Bis&#8208;Pocket Porphyrin Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4796-4803, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactivity study on the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction between C&#8722;H substrates and an Fe&#8208;nitrido porphyrin species was achieved by employing nanosecond laser flash photolysis and by using a bis&#8208;pocket porphyrin ligand. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters obtained in this study are fundamentally important for designing C&#8722;H amination and N2 fixation reactions involving Fe&#8208;nitrido intermediates.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;nitrido species are nitrogen analogues of iron&#8208;oxo species which are versatile reagents for C&#8722;H oxidation. Nonetheless, C&#8722;H activation by iron&#8208;nitrido species has been scarcely explored, as this is often hampered by their instability and short lifetime in solutions. Herein, the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactivity of an Fe porphyrin nitrido species (2&#8201;c) toward C&#8722;H substrates was studied in solutions at room temperature, which was achieved by nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) of its FeIII&#8208;azido precursor (1&#8201;c) supported by a bulky bis&#8208;pocket porphyrin ligand. C&#8722;H bonds with bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of up to &#8776;84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 could be activated, and the second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) are on the order of 102&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;1. The Fe&#8208;amido product formed after HAT could further release ammonia upon protonation.

         <title>Facile Access to an Active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH Electrocatalyst for Durable Water Oxidation Derived From an Intermetallic Nickel Germanide Precursor</title>

A xanthene&#8208;based bis(germylene)&#8208;Ni complex is used as a molecular precursor for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;small NiGe nanostructures, which can generate a &#947;&#8208;NiOOH structure with intercalated species. This displays exceptional catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
Identifying novel classes of precatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER by water oxidation) with enhanced catalytic activity and stability is a key strategy to enable chemical energy conversion. The vast chemical space of intermetallic phases offers plenty of opportunities to discover OER electrocatalysts with improved performance. Herein we report intermetallic nickel germanide (NiGe) acting as a superior activity and durable Ni&#8208;based electro(pre)catalyst for OER. It is produced from a molecular bis(germylene)&#8208;Ni precursor. The ultra&#8208;small NiGe nanocrystals deposited on both nickel foam and fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrodes showed lower overpotentials and a durability of over three weeks (505&#8197;h) in comparison to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and benchmark NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts under identical alkaline OER conditions. In contrast to other Ni&#8208;based intermetallic precatalysts under alkaline OER conditions, an unexpected electroconversion of NiGe into &#947;&#8208;NiIIIOOH with intercalated OH&#8722;/CO32&#8722; transpired that served as a highly active structure as shown by various ex&#8197;situ methods and quasi in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy.

         <title>General Access to Modified &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Bioinspired Stereoselective &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Lactonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4740-4746, February 23, 2021. </description>

Bioinspired stereoselective &#947;&#8208;aliphatic C&#8722;H bond lactonization of &#945;&#8208;amino acids using a manganese catalyst and H2O2 is reported. This method allows the oxidation of 1&#176;, 2&#176; and 3&#176; C&#8722;H bonds and the enantioselective preparation of chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino acids represent a valuable class of natural products employed as building blocks in biological and chemical synthesis. Because of the limited number of natural amino acids available, and of their widespread application in proteomics, diagnosis, drug delivery and catalysis, there is an increasing demand for the development of procedures for the preparation of modified analogues. Herein, we show that the use of bioinspired manganese catalysts and H2O2 under mild conditions, provides access to modified &#945;&#8208;amino acids via &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond lactonization. The system can efficiently target 1&#176;, 2&#176; and 3&#176; &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of &#945;&#8208;substituted and achiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids with outstanding site&#8208;selectivity, good to excellent diastereoselectivity and (where applicable) enantioselectivity. This methodology may be considered alternative to well&#8208;established organometallic procedures.

         <title>Stable Dioxin&#8208;Linked Metallophthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) as Photo&#8208;Coupled Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4864-4871, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable dioxin&#8208;linked metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were developed and applied for photo&#8208;coupled electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work represents a new insight for the future rational design of light sensitive crystalline materials for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
In this work, we rationally designed a series of crystalline and stable dioxin&#8208;linked metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs; MPc&#8208;TFPN COF, M=Ni, Co, Zn) under the guidance of reticular chemistry. As a novel single&#8208;site catalysts (SSCs), NiPc/CoPc&#8208;TFPN COF exhibited outstanding activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR; Faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO)=99.8(&#177;1.24)&#8201;%/ 96.1(&#177;1.25)&#8201;% for NiPc/CoPc&#8208;TFPN COF). More importantly, when coupled with light, the FECO and current density (jCO) were further improved across the applied potential range (&#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE) compared to the dark environment for NiPc&#8208;TFPN COF (jCO increased from 14.1 to 17.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V; FECO reached up to ca. 100&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V). Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth mechanism study was established by density functional theory (DFT) simulation and experimental characterization. For the first time, this work explored the application of COFs as photo&#8208;coupled electrocatalysts to improve ECR efficiency, which showed the potential of using light&#8208;sensitive COFs in the field of electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A series of stable dioxin&#8208;linked metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were developed and applied for photo&#8208;coupled electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.

         <title>Observation of the Reaction Intermediates of Methanol Dehydrogenation by Cationic Vanadium Clusters</title>

Strikingly different reactivity of vanadium and cobalt cationic clusters towards methanol in a low&#8208;pressure collision cell is observed by mass spectrometry. Metastable or kinetically trapped reaction intermediates of the methanol reaction with vanadium cationic clusters are verified, and their structures are proposed by exploring the reaction pathways using density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A mass spectrometric study of the reactions of vanadium cationic clusters with methanol in a low&#8208;pressure collision cell is reported. For comparison, the reaction of methanol with cobalt cationic clusters was studied. For vanadium, the main reaction products are fully dehydrogenated species, and partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species are observed as minors, for which the relative intensities increase with cluster size and also at low cluster source temperature cooled by liquid nitrogen; no dehydrogenation products were observed for cobalt clusters. Quantum chemical calculations explored the reaction pathways and revealed that the fully dehydrogenation products of the reaction between Vn+ and methanol are Vn(C)(O)+, in which C and O are separated owing to the high oxophilicity of vanadium. The partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species were verified to be reaction intermediates along the reaction pathway, and their most probable structures were proposed.

         <title>Double Fence Porphyrins that are Compatible with Cobalt(II/III) Electrolyte for High&#8208;Efficiency Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4886-4893, February 23, 2021. </description>

Double fence porphyrin dyes bJS1&#8211;bJS3 were designed and synthesized for high&#8208;efficiency dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared to typical single fence porphyrin dyes, double fence porphyrins show reduced dye aggregation and charge recombination, which has been evidenced with photovoltaic data and an improved solar cell device performance.







Abstract
A series of new double fence porphyrin dyes bJS1&#8211;bJS3, with eight long alkoxyl chains attached to four &#946;&#8208;phenyl groups, have been designed and synthesized. The single fence meso&#8208;substituted counterparts mJS1&#8211;mJS3 were also prepared as reference dyes. Dyes bJS1&#8211;bJS3 and mJS1&#8211;mJS3 exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 8.03&#8211;10.69&#8201;% and 2.33&#8211;6.69&#8201;%, respectively. Based on photovoltaic studies, the remarkable cell performance of double fence porphyrin sensitizers can be attributed to reduced dye aggregation and a decreased charge&#8208;recombination rate. Notably, porphyrins bJS2 and bJS3 exhibit better efficiency than the benchmark YD2&#8208;o&#8208;C8 (9.83&#8201;% in this work), demonstrating that the double fence structure is a promising design strategy for efficient porphyrin sensitizers in high&#8208;performance DSSCs.

         <title>Efficient Catalysts for the Green Synthesis of Adipic Acid from Biomass</title>

We present efficient catalysts for green and sustainable synthesis of adipic acid from biomass&#8208;derived glucose via glucaric acid. Pt/CNT with smaller (2.5&#8197;nm) Pt nanoparticles catalyzes the selective oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid. A bifunctional Pd&#8208;ReOx/AC catalyst offers 99&#8201;% yield of adipic acid from glucaric acid; the overall yield of adipic acid reaches 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
Green synthesis of adipic acid from renewable biomass is a very attractive goal of sustainable chemistry. Herein, we report efficient catalysts for a two&#8208;step transformation of cellulose&#8208;derived glucose into adipic acid via glucaric acid. Carbon nanotube&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles are found to work efficiently for the oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid. An activated carbon&#8208;supported bifunctional catalyst composed of rhenium oxide and palladium is discovered to be powerful for the removal of four hydroxyl groups in glucaric acid, affording adipic acid with a 99&#8201;% yield. Rhenium oxide functions for the deoxygenation but is less efficient for four hydroxyl group removal. The co&#8208;presence of palladium not only catalyzes the hydrogenation of olefin intermediates but also synergistically facilitates the deoxygenation. This work presents a green route for adipic acid synthesis and offers a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis strategy for efficient deoxygenation.

         <title>Tailored Catalytic Nanoframes from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Anisotropic Surface Modification and Etching for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

CA molecules can anisotropically modify and protect the {110} facets of the tZIF&#8208;67 crystal from etching, causing the six {100} facets be selectively etched via an inside&#8208;out manner, and finally forming the hollow nanoframes. The surface modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 can further be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts in an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes.







Abstract
A facile anisotropic surface modification and etching strategy is presented for the synthesis of hollow structured ZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. The strategy uses structural and compositional distinctions between each crystallographic facet of truncated rhombic dodecahedrons ZIF&#8208;67 (tZIF&#8208;67 RDs) and the moderate coordinating and etching effects of cyanuric acid (CA). The CA can anisotropically modify and protect the {110} facets from etching, causing the six {100} facets be selectively etched via an inside&#8208;out manner, and finally forming the hollow nanoframes. The surface&#8208;modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 RDs can be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts in an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. After calcination, the metal&#8208;tZIF&#8208;67 hybrids are converted into metal&#8208;Co alloy/C composite catalysts with hollow nanoframed structures. The PtCo/C catalyst with only 5.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt exhibits high catalytic activities and stabilities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions.

The strategy uses structural and compositional distinctions between each crystallographic facet of truncated rhombic dodecahedrons ZIF&#8208;67 (tZIF&#8208;67 RDs) and the moderate coordinating and etching effects of cyanuric acid (CA). The CA can anisotropically modify and protect the {110} facets from etching, causing the six {100} facets be selectively etched via an inside&#8208;out manner, and finally forming the hollow nanoframes. The surface&#8208;modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 RDs can be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts in an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. After calcination, the metal&#8208;tZIF&#8208;67 hybrids are converted into metal&#8208;Co alloy/C composite catalysts with hollow nanoframed structures. The PtCo/C catalyst with only 5.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt exhibits high catalytic activities and stabilities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Coupling of Cu(100) and (110) Facets Promotes Carbon Dioxide Conversion to Hydrocarbons and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4879-4885, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facet effect of copper crystals to promote CO adsorption and C&#8722;C coupling and consequently yield a superior selectivity (87&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) for C2+ products is described. Record&#8208;high solar conversion efficiencies of 4.47&#8201;% and 6.4&#8201;% are achieved for C2H4 and C2+ products, respectively.







Abstract
Copper can efficiently electro&#8208;catalyze carbon dioxide reduction to C2+ products (C2H4, C2H5OH, n&#8208;propanol). However, the correlation between the activity and active sites remains ambiguous, impeding further improvements in their performance. The facet effect of copper crystals to promote CO adsorption and C&#8722;C coupling and consequently yield a superior selectivity for C2+ products is described. We achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87&#8201;% and a large partial current density of 217&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward C2+ products on Cu(OH)2&#8208;D at only &#8722;0.54&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow&#8208;cell electrolyzer. With further coupled to a Si solar cell, record&#8208;high solar conversion efficiencies of 4.47&#8201;% and 6.4&#8201;% are achieved for C2H4 and C2+ products, respectively. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the selective formation of C2+ products on Cu and paves the way for the practical application of electrocatalytic or solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

         <title>Precise Distance Measurements in DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Dimers and Sandwich Complexes by Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4939-4947, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order G&#8208;quadruplex structures such as dimers and sandwich complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex binders are investigated with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy. Incorporated Cu(pyridine)4 complexes allow precise intermolecular Cu2+&#8208;Cu2+ distance measurements and reveal new binding motifs. High rigidity of the transition metal&#8208;based spin labels results in unprecedentedly narrow peaks in the distance distributions.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes show a pronounced tendency to form higher&#8208;order structures, such as &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers and aggregates with aromatic binding partners. Reliable methods for determining the structure of these non&#8208;covalent adducts are scarce. Here, we use artificial square&#8208;planar Cu(pyridine)4 complexes, covalently incorporated into tetramolecular G&#8208;quadruplexes, as rigid spin labels for detecting dimeric structures and measuring intermolecular Cu2+&#8211;Cu2+ distances via pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy. A series of G&#8208;quadruplex dimers of different spatial dimensions, formed in tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail or head&#8208;to&#8208;head stacking mode, were unambiguously distinguished. Measured distances are in full agreement with results of molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, intercalation of two well&#8208;known G&#8208;quadruplex binders, PIPER and telomestatin, into G&#8208;quadruplex dimers resulting in sandwich complexes was investigated, and previously unknown binding modes were discovered. Additionally, we present evidence that free G&#8208;tetrads also intercalate into dimers. Our transition metal labeling approach, combined with pulsed EPR spectroscopy, opens new possibilities for examining structures of non&#8208;covalent DNA aggregates.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Electron&#8208;Induced Photothermal Catalysis for Energy&#8208;Dependent Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4872-4878, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy carried by hot electrons can be liberated and used to enhance the electron&#8208;donating effect towards oxygen and reduce the potential energy surface of molecular oxygen activation (MOA). The activation energy of MOA decreased by 45.1&#8201;% and exhibited a substantial light dependence.







Abstract
Hot electrons activate reactants and reduce the activation energy barrier (Ea) of a reaction through electron donation. However, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic driving force of this electron&#8208;donating effect is lacking, let alone the precise manipulation of electron donation processes. Herein, the essential and promotional role of hot electron energy on the electron&#8208;donating effect was elucidated using molecular oxygen activation (MOA) as a model reaction. Through providing an available electron source to the conventional photo&#8208;thermal conversion system, the high energy carried by hot electrons was liberated and greatly enhanced the electron donation towards the LUMO (&#960;*) orbit of O2. The energy was also transferred to O2 and elevated the potential energy surface (PES) of MOA, which was reflected by the enhanced formation of superoxide oxygen anions. As predicted, the Ea of MOA decreased by 45.1&#8201;% and exhibited a substantial light dependence, demonstrating that MOA became energy&#8208;efficient due to improved exploitation and conversion of photon energies.

         <title>Unexpected Elasticity in Assemblies of Glassy Supra&#8208;Nanoparticle Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4894-4900, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supra&#8208;nanoparticle clusters (SNPCs) were synthesized by convergence of metal&#8211;organic polyhedron scaffolds with precise giant building blocks. The mechanical properties and structural dynamics can be regulated by fine&#8208;tuning the surface functionalization of the terminal POSS moieties. Unexpected elasticity with high Young's modulus of the OPOSS&#8208;ended SNPCs was found to be highly correlated with the interpenetration of the neighboring GLs.







Abstract
Granular materials, composed of densely packed particles, are known to possess unique mechanical properties that are highly dependent on the surface structure of the particles. A microscopic understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship in these systems remains unclear. Here, supra&#8208;nanoparticle clusters (SNPCs) with precise structures are developed as model systems to elucidate the unexpected elastic behaviors. SNPCs are prepared by coordination&#8208;driven assembly of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) with metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP). Due to the disparity in sizes, the POSS&#8208;MOP assemblies, like their classic nanoparticles counterparts, ordering is suppressed, and the POSS&#8208;MOP mixtures will vitrify or jam as a function of decreasing temperature. An unexpected elasticity is observed for the SNPC assemblies with a high modulus that is maintained at temperatures far beyond the glass transition temperature. From studies on the dynamics of the hierarchical structures of SNPCs and molecular dynamic simulation, the elasticity has its origins in the interpenetration of POSS&#8208;ended arms. The physical molecular interpenetration and inter&#8208;locking phenomenon favors the convenient solution or pressing processing of the novel cluster&#8208;based elastomers.

Ir1 effectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum of A549 lung cancer cells and triggers the production of ER stress and ROS production. Ir1 was demonstrated to induce multiple characteristics of immunogenic cell death (ICD) both in vitro and in an in vivo vaccination experiment. Ir1 is the first iridium(III) complex to induce ICD in non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer.







Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a vital component of therapeutically induced anti&#8208;tumor immunity. An iridium(III) complex (Ir1), containing an N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)&#8208;azane derivate, as an endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;localized ICD inducer for non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is reported. The characteristic discharge of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), that is, cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT), extracellular exclusion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and ATP, were generated by Ir1 in A549 lung cancer cells, accompanied by an increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The vaccination of immunocompetent mice with Ir1&#8208;treated dying cells elicited an antitumor CD8+ T cell response and Foxp3+ T cell depletion, which eventually resulted in long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;tumor immunity by the activation of ICD in lung cancer cells. Ir1 is the first Ir&#8208;based complex that is capable of developing an immunomodulatory response by immunogenic cell death.

         <title>Persistent Radical Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and Their Application in Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>

The incorporation of TTF radical trimers and RE6 cluster SBUs result in a stable 2D radical MOF that is stable under harsh conditions including aqueous acid/base solutions. Exhibiting the characteristics of light absorption and excellent stability, the radical Dy&#8208;MOF shows excellent photothermal conversion with an increase in temperature of 34.7&#8201;&#176;C upon irradiation by one unit of sunlight within 240&#8197;s.







Abstract
A series of stable radical 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks has been assembled. (m&#8208;TTFTB)3 (m&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;tetrabenzoate) trimer building blocks are beneficial for the stability of the radicals due to delocalization of the unpaired electron. Hexanuclear rare&#8208;earth&#8208;cluster&#8208;based 1D chains further enhance the stability of the frameworks. The radical state of the middle TTF in the trimer has been observed by the change of central C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bond distances and the configuration of the TTF by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The radical characteristics are also confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance, UV/Vis&#8211;NIR absorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. Stability tests showed that the radicals are stable even in solutions and under acid/base environments (pH&#8197;1&#8211;12). Owing to efficient light absorption due to intramolecular charge transfer, low thermal conductivity, and outstanding stability, the radical 2D Dy&#8208;MOF shows excellent photothermal properties, an increase of 34.7&#8201;&#176;C within 240&#8197;s under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Superseding &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato Ligands: An Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Imine Ligand Stabilizes the Exhaustive Series of B=X Boranes (X=O, S, Se, Te)</title>

The new N,N&#8242;&#8208;chelating amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand (HAmIm) was designed to supersede the widely employed &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand (HNacNac). The superior stability of the HAmIm system is exemplified for a series of chalcogenoboranes with confirmed B=X double bonds (X=O, S, Se, Te), which are isoelectronic and isolobal to ketones, including their heavier analogues.







Abstract
Boron reluctantly forms B=X (X=O, S, Se, Te) moieties, which has stimulated the quest for such species in the past few years. Based on the N,N&#8242;&#8208;chelating &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand (HNacNac), a new amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm) is presented, giving rise to the isolation of an exhaustive series of Lewis acid free, monomeric chalcogen B=X boranes with documented &#960;&#8208;bond character between boron and the chalcogen. The chalcogenoboranes are isoelectronic and isolobal to the respective ketones. The chemical behavior of the oxoborane (B=O) strongly resembles the classical carbonyl reactivity in C=O bonds. The improved stability provided by HAmIm arises from the formation of more&#8208;stable five&#8208;membered boron chelates versus the six&#8208;membered NacNac analogues and from the imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine moiety providing enhanced &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donation. The HAmIm ligand class may supersede the widely employed NacNac system in certain applications.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Coordinated Organoiridium(III) Complexes Exert Breast Anticancer Activity via Inhibition of Wnt/&#946;&#8208;Catenin Signaling</title>

The effects of sulfur&#8208;coordinated organoiridium(III) complexes were explored with respect to Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling, apoptosis, migration, invasion and &#8220;stemness&#8221; in breast cancer cells for the first time. pbtIrSS exerted appreciable anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastatic activities in breast cancer cells by inhibiting Wnt/ &#946;&#8208;catenin signaling and cancer stem cells.







Abstract
The sulfur&#8208;coordinated organoiridium(III) complexes pbtIrSS and ppyIrSS, which contain C,N and S,S (dithione) chelating ligands, were found to inhibit breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis by targeting Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling for the first time. Treatment with pbtIrSS and ppyIrSS induces the degradation of LRP6, thereby decreasing the protein levels of DVL2, &#946;&#8208;catenin and activated &#946;&#8208;catenin, resulting in downregulation of Wnt target genes CD44 and survivin. Additionally, pbtIrSS and ppyIrSS can suppress cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, both complexes show the ability to inhibit sphere formation and mediate the stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Importantly, pbtIrSS exerts potent anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis effects in mouse xenograft models through the blockage of Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that pbtIrSS has great potential to be developed as a breast cancer therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism.

         <title>Selection and Characterization of an RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzyme Activated by Legionella pneumophila</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4782-4788, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Legionella pneumophila is a pathogenic bacterium that exists in naturally occurring and man&#8208;made water sources. Contaminations with these bacteria in cooling towers have led to fatal disease outbreaks. An RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme was isolated and found to selectively recognize Legionella pneumophila bacteria in cooling tower water. RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes are synthetic DNA enzymes that can be easily incorporated into biosensor designs.







Abstract
Legionella pneumophila is a deadly bacterial pathogen that has caused numerous Legionnaires&#8217; disease outbreaks, where cooling towers were the most common source of exposure. Bacterial culturing is used for L. pneumophila detection, but this method takes approximately 10 days to complete. In this work, an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme, named LP1, was isolated. Extensive characterization revealed that LP1 is reactive with multiple infectious isolates of L.&#8197;pneumophila but inactive with 25 other common bacterial species. LP1 is likely activated by a protein target, capable of generating a detectable signal in the presence of as few as 10 colony&#8208;forming units of L. pneumophila, and able to maintain its activity in cooling tower water from diverse sources. Given that similar DNAzymes have been incorporated into many sensitive assays for bacterial detection, LP1 holds the potential for the development of biosensors for monitoring the contamination of L. pneumophila in exposure sources.

         <title>Racemic Monomer&#8208;Based One&#8208;Handed Helical Polymer Recognizes Enantiomers through Auto&#8208;Evolution of Its Helical Handedness Excess</title>

A racemic monomer&#8208;based polyacetylene folds into a one&#8208;handed helix assisted by a nonracemic alcohol through auto&#8208;evolution of its helical handedness over time, accompanied by successive enhancement of its optical purity adsorbed on the helical polyacetylene. The one&#8208;handed helical polyacetylene with the static helicity memory separates various enantiomers in liquid chromatography.







Abstract
A racemic monomer&#8208;based optically inactive polyacetylene folds into a one&#8208;handed helix assisted by a nonracemic alcohol, which can separate various enantiomers as a chiral stationary phase in chromatography. The chiral&#8208;resolving power is virtually identical to that of the enantiopure monomer&#8208;based one&#8208;handed helical polyacetylene. Because of its unique static memory of the induced helicity, the original racemic polyacetylene expresses an auto&#8208;evolution of its helical handedness over time, and at the same time, chirality of the nonracemic alcohol is discriminated accompanied by successive enhancement of its optical purity enantioselectively adsorbed on the helical polyacetylene owing to the chiral filter effect as directly monitored by NMR, which contributes to further enhancing the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;excess of the helical polyacetylene.

         <title>Environmental Control of Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Evolution and Conductance: A Case Study of Expanded Pyridinium Wiring</title>

Single&#8208;molecule junction conductance can be efficiently tuned by solvent environment. A series of expanded pyridinium molecular wires gave higher conductance with fully extended junction geometries in solvating water environment as opposed to mesitylene solvent. Environmental control efficiently operates the molecule&#8211;electrode interactions.







Abstract
Environmental control of single&#8208;molecule junction evolution and conductance was demonstrated for expanded pyridinium molecules by scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method and interpreted by quantum transport calculations including solvent molecules explicitly. Fully extended and highly conducting molecular junctions prevail in water environment as opposed to short and less conducting junctions formed in non&#8208;solvating mesitylene. A theoretical approach correctly models single&#8208;molecule conductance values considering the experimental junction length. Most pronounced difference in the molecular junction formation and conductance was identified for a molecule with the highest stabilization energy on the gold substrate confirming the importance of molecule&#8211;electrode interactions. Presented concept of tuning conductance through molecule&#8211;electrode interactions in the solvent&#8208;driven junctions can be used in the development of new molecular electronic devices.

         <title>Effect of Hydrophilic Monomer Distribution on Self&#8208;Assembly of a pH&#8208;Responsive Copolymer: Spheres, Worms and Vesicles from a Single Copolymer Composition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4925-4930, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copolymers of acrylic acid (AA) and butyl acrylate (BA) with constant overall composition (1:1 AA:BA) and controlled composition profiles (gradient, asymmetric diblock and asymmetric triblock) show dynamic pH&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior, with reversible changes in size and formation of sphere, worm and vesicle morphologies, in contrast to the frozen micelles formed by poly(AA&#8208;block&#8208;BA) block copolymers.







Abstract
A series of copolymers containing 50 mol&#8201;% acrylic acid (AA) and 50 mol&#8201;% butyl acrylate (BA) but with differing composition profiles ranging from an AA&#8208;BA diblock copolymer to a linear gradient poly(AA&#8208;grad&#8208;BA) copolymer were synthesized and their pH&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior was investigated. While assemblies of the AA&#8208;BA diblock copolymer were kinetically frozen, the gradient&#8208;like compositions underwent reversible changes in size and morphology in response to changes in pH. In particular, a diblock copolymer consisting of two random copolymer segments of equal length (16 mol&#8201;% and 84 mol&#8201;% AA content, respectively) formed spherical micelles at pH &gt;5, a mix of spherical and wormlike micelles at pH&#8197;5 and vesicles at pH&#8197;4. These assemblies were characterized by dynamic light scattering, cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering.

         <dc:description>
The radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methione (SAM) enzyme HydG can use S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;ethionine (SAE) in place of SAM during catalysis. HydG reacts with SAE and tyrosine to form the organometallic intermediate &#937;, similar to reaction with SAM. The SAE&#8208;bound [4Fe&#8208;4S]+ cluster of HydG undergoes cryogenic blue light photolysis to generate an ethyl radical. Upon annealing the radical forms an organometallic species in which an ethyl is bound to the unique iron of a [4Fe&#8208;4S]3+ cluster.







Abstract
Radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzymes initiate biological radical reactions with the 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl radical (5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo.). A [4Fe&#8208;4S]+ cluster reductively cleaves SAM to form the &#937; organometallic intermediate in which the 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl moiety is directly bound to the unique iron of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster, with subsequent liberation of 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo.. We present synthesis of the SAM analog S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;ethionine (SAE) and show SAE is a mechanistically equivalent SAM&#8208;alternative for HydG, both supporting enzymatic turnover of substrate tyrosine and forming the organometallic intermediate &#937;. Photolysis of SAE&#8208;bound HydG forms an ethyl radical trapped in the active site. The ethyl radical withstands prolonged storage at 77&#8197;K and its EPR signal is only partially lost upon annealing at 100&#8197;K, making it significantly less reactive than the methyl radical formed by SAM photolysis. Upon annealing above 77&#8197;K, the ethyl radical adds to the [4Fe&#8208;4S]2+ cluster, generating an ethyl&#8208;[4Fe&#8208;4S]3+ organometallic species termed &#937;E.

&lt;p&gt;Radical &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzymes initiate biological radical reactions with the 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl radical (5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;). A [4Fe&#8208;4S]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cluster reductively cleaves SAM to form the &#937; organometallic intermediate in which the 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl moiety is directly bound to the unique iron of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster, with subsequent liberation of 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;. We present synthesis of the SAM analog &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;ethionine (SAE) and show SAE is a mechanistically equivalent SAM&#8208;alternative for HydG, both supporting enzymatic turnover of substrate tyrosine and forming the organometallic intermediate &#937;. Photolysis of SAE&#8208;bound HydG forms an ethyl radical trapped in the active site. The ethyl radical withstands prolonged storage at 77&#8197;K and its EPR signal is only partially lost upon annealing at 100&#8197;K, making it significantly less reactive than the methyl radical formed by SAM photolysis. Upon annealing above 77&#8197;K, the ethyl radical adds to the [4Fe&#8208;4S]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cluster, generating an ethyl&#8208;[4Fe&#8208;4S]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; organometallic species termed &#937;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phenylpyridyl&#8208;Fused Boroles: A Unique Coordination Mode and Weak B&#8722;N Coordination&#8208;Induced Dual Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4833-4840, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused boroles [TipPBB1]4 and TipPBB2 were synthesized and their properties investigated. [TipPBB1]4 forms a tetramer in both the solid state and solution. TipPBB2 contains a 4&#8208;coordinate boron atom in the solid state but dissociates to give a 3&#8208;coordinate boron species in solution. TipPBB2 shows interesting temperature&#8208;dependent dual fluorescence in solution because of the equilibrium between 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;coordinate boron species due to weak N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B intermolecular coordination.







Abstract
Using 4&#8208;phenylpyridine or 2&#8208;phenylpyridine in place of biphenyl, two electron&#8208;poor phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused boroles, [TipPBB1]4 and TipPBB2 were prepared. [TipPBB1]4 adopts a unique coordination mode and forms a tetramer with a cavity in both the solid state and solution. The boron center of TipPBB2 is 4&#8208;coordinate in the solid state but the system dissociates in solution, leading to 3&#8208;coordinate borole species. Compared to its borafluorene analogues, the electron&#8208;accepting ability of TipPBB2 is largely enhanced by the pyridyl group. TipPBB2 exhibits dual fluorescence in solution due to an equilibrium between free TipPBB2 and a weak intermolecular coordination adduct with a second molecule. This equilibrium was further investigated by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and photophysical studies. Theoretical studies indicate that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of TipPBB2 localizes at the Tip group, in contrast to its borafluorene derivatives, wherein the HOMOs are localized on the borafluorene cores.

Anion&#8208;sealed capsules are formed via hydrogen bonding interactions between pyrogallol[5]arenes or resorcin[5]arenes with anions, as described by Agnieszka Szumna and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;4540. The capsules have a dodecahedral geometry and exist in THF and in benzene, but not in chloroform, reflecting competitive effects in the solvation of anions. It is also demonstrated that mechanochemical pretreatment (dry&#8208;milling) of solid samples is indispensable to initialize self&#8208;assembly in benzene.

         <title>At Long Last: The Me3Si Group as a Masked Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4408-4410, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a long time, the Me3Si group has been ostracized from the family of aryl&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted congeners for the difficulties associated with its further chemoselective manipulation into another synthetically useful functional group. A hypervalent iodine reagent has now been shown to do exactly that by electrophilic demethylation. Coupled with the Tamao&#8211;Fleming oxidation, the Me3Si group becomes a placeholder for a hydroxy group.

         <title>The Logic Behind Markovnikov's Rule: Was It an Inspired Guess? &#8230;No!</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4412-4421, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Markovnikov's 1870 Annalen paper, many western authors have viewed his rule as a relatively unimportant addendum to a paper on isobutyric acid derivatives, and some have suggested that the rule itself was simply an inspired guess. In this Essay, based on an analysis of his work on the structure of the double bond in his graduate dissertations, the argument is made that it was not.







Abstract
Vladimir Vasil&#8242;evich Markovnikov (1837&#8211;1904) was a Russian chemist whose graduate research at Kazan Imperial University from 1860&#8211;1869 gave us, among other things, one of the most enduring empirical rules in organic chemistry. Markovnikov's Rule for electrophilic addition was first published in the inaugural volume of the Journal of the Russian Chemical Society (Zh. Russ. Khim. O&#8208;va.), but it was not until a year later when it was published in German that it received attention internationally. The rule itself was worded differently from the most common modern versions, in that it is expressed in terms of the electronegative part of the adding reagent. It has been suggested that this rule was the result of an inspired guess, but a careful examination of Markovnikov's graduate dissertations reveals a very different picture. In the dissertations, there is a careful build&#8208;up of logic from which the rule itself, as defined by Markovnikov, emerges naturally. Markovnikov's Rule was most decidedly not an inspired guess.

         <title>Polymerized Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>

This Minireview describes developments in all&#8208;polymer solar cells containing a new type of n&#8208;type conjugated polymer, polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (PSMAs). PSMAs combine the merits of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (narrow band gap, strong absorption, and suitable electronic energy levels) with the good film formation, higher morphology and light&#8208;irradiation stability of polymers.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have drawn tremendous research interest in recent years, due to their inherent advantages of good film formation, stable morphology, and mechanical flexibility. The most representative and most widely used n&#8208;CP acceptor was the naphthalene diimide based D&#8208;A copolymer N2200 before 2017, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the all&#8208;PSCs based on N2200 reached over 8% in 2016. However, the low absorption coefficient of N2200 in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region limits the further increase of its PCE. In 2017, we proposed a strategy of polymerizing small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) to construct new&#8208;generation polymer acceptors. The polymerized SMAs (PSMAs) possess low band gap and strong absorption in the NIR region, which attracted great attention and drove the PCE of the all&#8208;PSCs to over 15% recently. In this Minireview we explain the design strategies of the molecular structure of PSMAs and describe recent research progress. Finally, current challenges and future prospects of the PSMAs are analyzed and discussed.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4434-4447, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic oxidative kinetic resolutions (OKR), in which a new oxygen atom is inserted into the substrate, are highly effective for the synthesis of enantioenriched oxygen&#8208;containing compounds. This Minireview discusses selected enzyme classes that can achieve OKR, biological advancements and protein development, and the use of these key enantioenriched intermediates in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution using biocatalysis has proven to be an excellent complementary technique to traditional asymmetric catalysis for the production of enantioenriched compounds. Resolution using oxidative enzymes produces valuable oxygenated structures for use in synthetic route development. This Minireview focuses on enzymes which catalyse the insertion of an oxygen atom into the substrate and, in so doing, can achieve oxidative kinetic resolution. The Baeyer&#8211;Villiger rearrangement, epoxidation, and hydroxylation are included, and biological advancements in enzyme development, and applications of these key enantioenriched intermediates in natural product synthesis are discussed.

         <title>Intrinsic Electrocatalytic Activity Regulation of M&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4448-4463, February 23, 2021. </description>

Regulation strategies for enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction activity of M&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are summarized in this review. Four components are considered in the optimization of the catalyst: the center metal atoms, the coordinated atoms, the environmental atoms, and the guest groups.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with highly active sites atomically dispersed on substrates exhibit unique advantages regarding maximum atomic efficiency, abundant chemical structures, and extraordinary catalytic performances for multiple important reactions. In particular, M&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs (M=transition metal atom) demonstrate optimal electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and have attracted extensive attention recently. Despite substantial efforts in fabricating various M&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs, the principles for regulating the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of their active sites have not been sufficiently studied. In this Review, we summarize the regulation strategies for promoting the intrinsic electrocatalytic ORR activity of M&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs by modulation of the center metal atoms, the coordinated atoms, the environmental atoms, and the guest groups. Theoretical calculations and experimental investigations are both included to afford a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8211;performance relationship. Finally, future directions of developing advanced M&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs for electrocatalytic ORR and other analogous reactions are proposed.

         <title>Synthesis of Nitride Zeolites in a Hot Isostatic Press</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4470-4473, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitridophosphate zeolites AE3P5N10X (AE=Sr, Ba; X=Cl, Br) were synthesized under medium&#8208;pressure conditions (150&#8197;MPa N2, 1200&#8201;&#176;C), extending the range of the degree of condensation for nitridophosphates accessible by hot isostatic pressing from &#954;=1/3 to 1/2. AE3P5N10X:Eu2+ (AE=Sr, Ba; X=Cl, Br) reveals natural&#8208;white to deep&#8208;red emission.







Abstract
The recently introduced nitridophosphate synthesis in a hot isostatic press (HIP) enabled simple access to large&#8208;scale product quantities starting from exclusively commercially available starting materials. Herein, we show that this method is suitable for the synthesis of highly condensed functional nitridophosphates, as well. Hence, the syntheses of the nitridophosphate zeolites Ba3P5N10X (X=Cl, Br) are presented as proof of concept for this innovative access. Furthermore, samples of unprecedented Sr3P5N10X (X=Cl, Br) were prepared and characterized to demonstrate the advantages of this synthetic approach over commonly used methods. Luminescence investigations on Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of AE3P5N10X (AE=Sr, Ba; X=Cl, Br) were carried out and characteristics of observed emission bands are discussed.

         <title>Improving the Overall Properties of Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials Through Arene&#8211;Perfluoroarene Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4575-4580, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular self&#8208;assembly driven by arene&#8211;perfluoroarene (AP) interactions are demonstrated in chiral polyaromatic hydrocarbons and octafluoronaphthalene. They exhibit a large figure of merit for boosting circularly polarized luminescence. The AP interaction amplifies both ground&#8208;state and excited&#8208;state chirality. Due to the high energy barrier of octafluoronaphthalene, the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of the AP complex could be significantly enhanced.







Abstract
A major trade&#8208;off in the field of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of pure organic materials is that the large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) usually gives rise to the suppression of luminescence efficiency (&#934;PL). Here, a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled system, driven by arene&#8211;perfluoroarene (AP) interactions of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and octafluoronaphthalene (OFN), is reported to provide a solution to this problem. Two kinds of chiral PAHs based on pyrene and anthracene could co&#8208;assemble with OFN in hybrid solvents to form long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered AP assemblies. The detailed process of AP interaction driving self&#8208;assembly was verified by morphological measurements and fluorescence spectra. The AP assemblies exhibited chirality amplification not only in the excited state but also in the ground state. In addition, the AP assemblies showed an enhanced luminescence efficiency compared with the individual chiral PAHs due to the energy&#8208;barrier effect of OFN. The present strategy based on AP interactions could be applied to boost the development of highly efficient CPL&#8208;active materials.

         <title>2,4,6&#8208;Triphenylpyridinium: A Bulky, Highly Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituent That Enhances Properties of Nickel(II) Ethylene Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4566-4569, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium (trippy) group is used to enhance properties of nickel olefin polymerization catalysts. Comparison with the corresponding CF3&#8208;substituted complex shows the advantages of catalysts possessing the new substituent. High steric bulk combined with powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of this substituent result in increased catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight for the trippy&#8208;substituted complex.







Abstract
The reactivity of NiII and PdII olefin polymerization catalysts can be enhanced by introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the supporting ligands rendering the metal centers more electrophilic. Reported here is a comparison of ethylene polymerization activity of a classical salicyliminato nickel catalyst substituted with the powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium (trippy) group to the &#8208;CF3 analogue. The trippy substituent is substantially more electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#963;meta=0.63) than the trifluoromethyl group (&#963;meta=0.43) which results in a ca. 8&#8208;fold increase in catalytic turnover frequency. An additional advantage of trippy is the high steric bulk relative to the trifluoromethyl group. This feature results in a four&#8208;fold increase in polymer molecular weight owing to enhanced retardation of chain transfer. A significant increase in catalyst lifetime is observed as well.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of the C3O2&#8722; Anion with an Unexpected Unsymmetrical Structure</title>

The carbon suboxide anion C3O2&#8722; is generated in a solid neon matrix, and is characterized to have an unsymmetrical structure by the bonding interactions between a neutral CO in a triplet excited state and a doublet excited state of CCO&#8722;.







Abstract
The carbon suboxide anion C3O2&#8722; is generated in solid neon matrix. It is characterized by infrared absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations to have a planar Cs structure where two CO groups with significantly different bond lengths and angles are attached in a zigzag fashion to the central carbon atom. Bonding analysis indicates that it is best described by the bonding interactions between a neutral CO in a triplet excited state and a doublet excited state of CCO&#8722;.

         <title>A Stable Triplet&#8208;Ground&#8208;State Conjugated Diradical Based on a Diindenopyrazine Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4594-4598, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable triplet&#8208;ground&#8208;state conjugated diradical with pyrazine as a linker group was synthesized with a half&#8208;life time of about 22&#8197;days under ambient conditions. The electron&#8208;deficient pyrazine unit impedes spin delocalization to the peripheral phenyl rings, which increases the spin density distribution on the central meta&#8208;pyrazine unit, leading to a large &#916;ES&#8208;T.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin conjugated radicals have great potential in magnetic materials and organic spintronics. However, to obtain high&#8208;spin conjugated radicals is still quite challenging due to their poor stability. We report the successful synthesis and isolation of a stable triplet conjugated diradical, 10,12&#8208;diaryldiindeno[1,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8208;e]pyrazine (m&#8208;DIP). With the m&#8208;xylylene analogue skeleton containing electron&#8208;deficient sp2&#8208;nitrogen atoms, m&#8208;DIP displays significant aromatic character within its pyrazine ring and its spin density mainly delocalizes on the meta&#8208;pyrazine unit, making it a triplet ground state conjugated diradical. Our work provides an effective &#8220;spin density tuning&#8221; strategy for stable high&#8208;spin conjugated radicals.

         <title>Control of Crystallinity and Stereocomplexation of Synthetic Carbohydrate Polymers from d&#8208; and l&#8208;Xylose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4524-4528, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic carbohydrate polyethers, which are polysaccharide mimics, are synthesised by regioregular anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerisation of oxetanes produced from d&#8208; or l&#8208;xylose. By exploiting the chirality of xylose and varying stereochemical composition, the crystallinity of the resulting materials can be controlled. Mixing together homochiral polymers of opposite configuration results in a stereocomplex with enhanced thermal properties.







Abstract
Manipulating the stereochemistry of polymers is a powerful method to alter their physical properties. Despite the chirality of monosaccharides, reports on the impact of stereochemistry in natural polysaccharides and synthetic carbohydrate polymers remain absent. Herein, we report the cocrystallisation of regio&#8208; and stereoregular polyethers derived from d&#8208; and l&#8208;xylose, leading to enhanced thermal properties compared to the enantiopure polymers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a stereocomplex between carbohydrate polymers of opposite chirality. In contrast, atactic polymers obtained from a racemic mixture of monomers are amorphous. We also show that the polymer hydroxyl groups are amenable to post&#8208;polymerisation functionalization. These strategies afford a family of carbohydrate polyethers, the physical and chemical properties of which can both be controlled, and which opens new possibilities for polysaccharide mimics in biomedical applications or as advanced materials.

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous aldol&#8208;type reaction of allylazaarenes is disclosed. It provides an array of chiral &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated azaarenes in moderate to excellent regio&#8208;, (E)/(Z)&#8208;, and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A vinylogous aldol&#8208;type reaction of allylazaarenes and aldehydes is disclosed that affords a series of chiral &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated azaarenes in moderate to excellent yields with high to excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. With (R,RP)&#8208;TANIAPHOS and (R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* as the ligand, the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in the products is generated in (E)&#8208;form. With (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS as the ligand, (Z)&#8208;form carbon&#8208;carbon double bond is formed in the major product. In this vinylogous reaction, aromatic, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated, and aliphatic aldehydes are competent substrates. Moreover, a variety of azaarenes, such as pyrimidine, pyridine, pyrazine, quinoline, quinoxaline, quinazoline, and benzo[d]imidazole are well&#8208;tolerated. At last, the chiral vinylogous product is demonstrated as a suitable Michael acceptor towards CuI&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition with organomagnesium reagents.

         <title>Nanoscale Hyperspectral Imaging of Amyloid Secondary Structures in Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4545-4550, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic (TERS) mapping in liquid is shown to be an efficient tool to investigate the secondary structure of the neurodegenerative peptide amyloid&#8208;&#946;. The high heat capacity of liquid increased the capability of TERS, allowing an observation of the conformational transition from the antiparallel arrangement of &#946;&#8208;sheets in protofibrils to parallel in fibrils, at the single aggregates level.







Abstract
Abnormal aggregation of amyloid&#8208;&#946; is a very complex and heterogeneous process. Owing to methodological limitations, the aggregation pathway is still not fully understood. Herein a new approach is presented in which the secondary structure of single amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregates is investigated with tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) in a liquid environment. Clearly resolved TERS signatures of the amide&#8197;I and amide&#8197;III bands enabled a detailed analysis of the molecular structure of single aggregates at each phase of the primary aggregation of amyloid&#8208;&#946; and also of small species on the surface of fibrils attributed to secondary nucleation. Notably, a &#946;&#8208;sheet rearrangement from antiparallel in protofibrils to parallel in fibrils is observed. This study allows better understanding of Alzheimer's disease etiology and the methodology can be applied in studies of other neurodegenerative disorders.

     alt="Nanoscale Hyperspectral Imaging of Amyloid Secondary Structures in Liquid"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic (TERS) mapping in liquid is shown to be an efficient tool to investigate the secondary structure of the neurodegenerative peptide amyloid&#8208;&#946;. The high heat capacity of liquid increased the capability of TERS, allowing an observation of the conformational transition from the antiparallel arrangement of &#946;&#8208;sheets in protofibrils to parallel in fibrils, at the single aggregates level.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abnormal aggregation of amyloid&#8208;&#946; is a very complex and heterogeneous process. Owing to methodological limitations, the aggregation pathway is still not fully understood. Herein a new approach is presented in which the secondary structure of single amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregates is investigated with tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) in a liquid environment. Clearly resolved TERS signatures of the amide&#8197;I and amide&#8197;III bands enabled a detailed analysis of the molecular structure of single aggregates at each phase of the primary aggregation of amyloid&#8208;&#946; and also of small species on the surface of fibrils attributed to secondary nucleation. Notably, a &#946;&#8208;sheet rearrangement from antiparallel in protofibrils to parallel in fibrils is observed. This study allows better understanding of Alzheimer's disease etiology and the methodology can be applied in studies of other neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of Iron Nitride as Catalytic Material for Efficient Hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4496-4500, February 23, 2021. </description>

Fe2N@C core&#8211;shell nanoparticles were highly efficient for the thermal catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 with excellent C2+ selectivity of 53.96&#177;1.33&#8201;% and outstanding lower olefins (C2&#8208;C4=) selectivity of 31.03&#177;1.05&#8201;%. Our results revealed the in situ restructuring of Fe2N into iron carbides via a carbonyl iron&#8208;mediated conversion mechanism. Iron carbides were identified as active species for selectively converting CO2&#8208;H2 to C2+ hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Developing efficient catalytic materials and unveiling the active species are significant for selective hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ hydrocarbons. Fe2N@C nanoparticles were reported to exhibit outstanding performance toward selective CO2 hydrogenation to C2+ hydrocarbons (C2+ selectivity: 53.96&#8201;%; C2&#8208;C4= selectivity, 31.03&#8201;%), outperforming corresponding Fe@C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, ex situ M&#246;ssbauer and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra revealed that iron nitrides were in situ converted to highly active iron carbides, which acted as the real active species. Moreover, the combined results of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and control experiments suggested an in situ formed carbonyl iron&#8208;mediated conversion mechanism from iron nitrides to iron carbides.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Protein Self&#8208;Organization by Orthogonal Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Tools</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4501-4506, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed orthogonal chemo&#8208;optogenetic tools as a minimal regulation strategy to fine&#8208;tune in&#8208;vitro protein self&#8208;organization with light. Our chemo&#8208;optogenetic tools are designed by orthogonal translation with an expanded genetic code. Such introduced bio&#8208;orthogonal chemical groups operate at the level of single specific amino acids, but perform tight control of enzyme activity and, thereby, the ability of protein self&#8208;organization.







Abstract
A universal gain&#8208;of&#8208;function approach for the spatiotemporal control of protein activity is highly desirable when reconstituting biological modules in&#8197;vitro. Here we used orthogonal translation with a photocaged amino acid to map and elucidate molecular mechanisms in the self&#8208;organization of the prokaryotic filamentous cell&#8208;division protein (FtsZ) that is highly relevant for the assembly of the division ring in bacteria. We masked a tyrosine residue of FtsZ by site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged tyrosine analogue. While the mutant still shows self&#8208;assembly into filaments, dynamic self&#8208;organization into ring patterns can no longer be observed. UV&#8208;mediated uncaging revealed that tyrosine 222 is essential for the regulation of the protein's GTPase activity, self&#8208;organization, and treadmilling dynamics. Thus, the light&#8208;mediated assembly of functional protein modules appears to be a promising minimal&#8208;regulation strategy for building up molecular complexity towards a minimal cell.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Electron Transfer and Catalytic Mechanism of Carnitine Oxidation by Rieske&#8208;Type Oxygenase from Human Microbiota</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4529-4534, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using photoactivated NADH and EPR spectroscopy, a method to monitor the changes in redox state(s) of the metal centers in the multi&#8208;component, non&#8208;heme enzymes was developed. Combined with annealing, the detailed mechanism of the catalytic conversion of carnitine into TMA and MSA by AbCntA/AbCntB in the human microbiota are investigated.







Abstract
Oxidation of quaternary ammonium substrate, carnitine by non&#8208;heme iron containing Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) oxygenase CntA/reductase CntB is implicated in the onset of human cardiovascular disease. Herein, we develop a blue&#8208;light (365&#8197;nm) activation of NADH coupled to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements to study electron transfer from the excited state of NADH to the oxidized, Rieske&#8208;type, [2Fe&#8208;2S]2+ cluster in the AbCntA oxygenase domain with and without the substrate, carnitine. Further electron transfer from one&#8208;electron reduced, Rieske&#8208;type [2Fe&#8208;2S]1+ center in AbCntA&#8208;WT to the mono&#8208;nuclear, non&#8208;heme iron center through the bridging glutamate E205 and subsequent catalysis occurs only in the presence of carnitine. The electron transfer process in the AbCntA&#8208;E205A mutant is severely affected, which likely accounts for the significant loss of catalytic activity in the AbCntA&#8208;E205A mutant. The NADH photo&#8208;activation coupled with EPR is broadly applicable to trap reactive intermediates at low temperature and creates a new method to characterize elusive intermediates in multiple redox&#8208;centre containing proteins.

A peptide&#8208;based bistable reaction network was programmed to control a cascade reaction influencing Au nanoparticle morphology, self&#8208;assembly kinetics and shape. This study offers a clear demonstration of how bridging the fields of systems chemistry and nanotechnology can expand our repertoire of functional materials.







Abstract
Living cells exploit bistable and oscillatory behaviors as memory mechanisms, facilitating the integration of transient stimuli into sustained molecular responses that control downstream functions. Synthetic bistable networks have also been studied as memory entities, but have rarely been utilized to control orthogonal functions in coupled dynamic systems. We herein present a new cascade pathway, for which we have exploited a well&#8208;characterized switchable peptide&#8208;based replicating network, operating far from equilibrium, that yields two alternative steady&#8208;state outputs, which in turn serve as the input signals for consecutive processes that regulate various features of Au nanoparticle shape and assembly. This study further sheds light on how bridging together the fields of systems chemistry and nanotechnology may open up new opportunities for the dynamically controlled design of functional materials.

         <title>Adsorption Site Selective Occupation Strategy within a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Sieving Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4570-4574, February 23, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8211;organic framework (CPL&#8208;1&#8208;NH2) with keyhole&#8208;like pore apertures offers selective adsorption site properties for gas separation. Amine groups limit interactions with CO2 molecules by decreasing the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption, whereas the binding affinity of C2H2 is increased (see picture, distances in &#197;). CPL&#8208;1&#8208;NH2 demonstrates a remarkably high C2H2 selectivity with C2H2/CO2 (50/50) mixtures at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K.







Abstract
The separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide is an essential but challenging process owing to the similar molecular sizes and physical properties of the two gas molecules. Notably, these molecules usually exhibit different orientations in the pore channel. We report an adsorption site selective occupation strategy by taking advantage of differences in orientation to sieve the C2H2 from CO2 in a judiciously designed amine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework, termed CPL&#8208;1&#8208;NH2. In this material, the incorporation of amino groups not only occupies the adsorption sites of CO2 molecules and shields the interaction of uncoordinated oxygen atom and CO2 molecules resulting in a negligible adsorption amount and a decrease in enthalpy of adsorption but also strengthened the binding affinity toward C2H2 molecules. This material thus shows an extremely high amount of C2H2 at low pressure and a remarkably high C2H2/CO2 IAST selectivity (119) at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K.

The formation of exceptionally large capsular species (diameter of c. a. 30&#8197;&#197;) by interactions of polyphenolic macrocycles with 5&#8208;fold symmetry with anions is reported. Pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes interact with anions via hydrogen bonds involving phenolic OH groups or aromatic CH groups. A (P5H)12(X&#8722;)60 or (R5H)12(X&#8722;)60 stoichiometry and a unique dodecahedral geometry of one of the Platonic solids is postulated.







Abstract
The paper reports formation of exceptionally large capsular species (diameter of c. a. 30&#8197;&#197;) by interactions of polyphenolic macrocycles with 5&#8208;fold symmetry with anions. Pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes interact with anions via hydrogen bonds involving phenolic OH groups or aromatic CH groups. Based on NMR titration experiments, diffusion coefficients, and geometric requirements, it is postulated that the capsules have (P5H)12(X&#8722;)60 or (R5H)12(X&#8722;)60 stoichiometry and a unique geometry of one of the Platonic solids&#8212;a dodecahedron. The capsules exist in THF and in benzene, but not in chloroform, reflecting competitive effects in the solvation of anions. It is also demonstrated that mechanochemical pre&#8208;treatment (dry&#8208;milling) of solid samples is indispensable to initialize self&#8208;assembly in benzene.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Donor Catalyzed Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4535-4539, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique combination of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and acid catalysis enabled rapid vinyl ether polymerization under an ambient atmosphere. This controlled polymerization furnished polymers with molecular weights above 60&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Importantly, several key intermolecular interactions between the organic acid and HBD were crucial for successful polymerization.







Abstract
The synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(vinyl ethers) under mild conditions is a significant challenge, since cationic polymerization reactions are highly sensitive to chain&#8208;transfer and termination events. We identified a novel and highly effective hydrogen bond donor (HBD)&#8211;organic acid pair that can facilitate controlled cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers under ambient conditions with excellent monomer compatibility. Poly(vinyl ethers) of molar masses exceeding 50&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1 can be produced within 1&#8197;h without elaborate reagent purification. Modification of the HBD structure allowed tuning of the polymerization rate, while DFT calculations helped elucidate crucial intermolecular interactions between the HBD, organic acid, and polymer chain end.

Enantioselective gold&#8208;catalyzed [3+2]annulations between highly substituted cyclopentadienes and &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones yielded gold enolate intermediates. These form complex pairs with chiral phosphoric acid to enhance the enantioselectivity.







Abstract
This work reports gold&#8208;catalyzed [3+2]&#8208;annulations of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with highly substituted cyclopentadienes, affording bicyclic 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The reactions highlights the first success of tetrasubstituted alkenes to undergo [3+2]&#8208;annulations with &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyls. The enantioselective annulations are also achieved with high enantioselectivity using chiral forms of gold and phosphoric acid. Our mechanistic analysis supports that cyclopentadienes serve as nucleophiles to attack gold carbenes at the more substituted alkenes, yielding gold enolates that complex with chiral phosphoric acid to enhance the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Silver in the Center Enhances Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of a Platinum Sub&#8208;nanocluster by 18 Times</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4551-4554, February 23, 2021. </description>

A highly luminescent Ag+ doped Pt cluster is reported. Compared to the original platinum thiolate complex, the inclusion of silver ion has boosted photoluminescent quantum yield by 18 times. The LUMO, which has the main contribution from the Ag s&#8208;orbital and Pt d&#8208;orbitals, plays a critical role in suppressing the structural distortion at the excited state.







Abstract
There has been controversy surrounding the roles of the metal core (metal&#8211;metal interaction) and the shell (metal&#8211;ligand interaction) in photoluminescence of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters. We have discovered aggregation&#8208;induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of a platinum&#8211;thiolate complex and its silver ion inclusion complex (a silver&#8208;doped platinum sub&#8208;nanocluster). The inclusion of silver ion boosted the photoluminescent quantum yield by 18 times. Photophysical measurements indicate that the rate of nonradiative decay was slower for the silver&#8208;doped platinum sub&#8208;nanocluster. DFT calculations showed that the LUMO, which had the main contribution from Ag s&#8208;orbital and Pt d&#8208;orbitals, played a critical role in suppressing the structural distortion at the excited state. This work will hopefully stimulate more research on designing strategies based on molecular orbitals of atomicity&#8208;precise luminescent multimetallic nanoclusters.

DFT calculations showed that the LUMO, which had the main contribution from Ag s&#8208;orbital and Pt d&#8208;orbitals, played a critical role in suppressing the structural distortion at the excited state. This work will hopefully stimulate more research on designing strategies based on molecular orbitals of atomicity&#8208;precise luminescent multimetallic nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ruthenaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Three&#8208;Component Alkyne Annulation for Expedient Isoquinoline Assembly</title>

Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative three&#8208;component syntheses of isoquinolines proved viable with ample scope. The isolation of key intermediates, along with DFT calculations revealed an unusual ruthenium(II/III/I) catalytic cycle.







Abstract
The electrochemical three&#8208;component assembly of isoquinolines has been accomplished by ruthenaelectro&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H functionalization. The robustness of the electrocatalysis was reflected by an ample substrate scope, an efficient electrooxidation, and an operationally friendly procedure. The isolation of key intermediates and detailed mechanistic studies, including unprecedented cyclovoltammetric analysis of a seven&#8208;membered ruthenacycle, provided support for an unusual ruthenium(II/III/I) regime.

         <title>Almost 100&#8201;% Peroxymonosulfate Conversion to Singlet Oxygen on Single&#8208;Atom CoN2+2 Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4588-4593, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In PMS activation 1O2 becomes the predominant reactive oxygen species mediated by single&#8208;atom CoN2+2 sites. The weakly positive Co atoms and CoN2+2 coordination direct PMS oxidation by a non&#8208;radical pathway with simultaneous 1O2 generation. This work is beneficial for rational regulation of 1O2 generation at the atomic level.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom CoN4 active sites have demonstrated excellent efficiency in peroxymonosulfate activation. However, the identification of CoN4 active sites and the detailed singlet oxygen generation mechanism in peroxymonosulfate activation remains ambiguous. We demonstrate a strategy to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species by atomically dispersed cobalt anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. As indicated by experiment and DFT calculations, CoN2+2 was the active site and singlet oxygen was the predominant reactive oxygen species with a proportion of 98.89&#8201;%. Spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed peroxymonosulfate on the CoN2+2 active sites was energetically unfavorable because of the weakly positive Co atoms and CoN2+2 coordination, which directed PMS oxidation by a non&#8208;radical pathway and with simultaneous singlet oxygen generation. The generated singlet oxygen degraded several organic pollutants with high efficiency across a broad pH range.

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component Coupling of Heteroarenes, Cycloalkenes and Propargylic Acetates</title>

Wacker&#8208;type reaction of cyclic alkenes, propargylic acetates and nucleophilic heteroarenes and arenes, including indoles, pyrroles, activated thiophenes, furans and anilines, proceeds to give trans isomers of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans.







Abstract
Asymmetric coupling proceeds efficiently between propargylic acetates, cycloalkenes and electron&#8208;rich heteroarenes including indoles, pyrroles, activated furans and thiophenes. 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted tetrahydrofurans and pyrrolidines are produced in trans configuration and excellent enantiomeric ratios. The reaction proceeds via Wacker&#8208;type attack of nucleophilic heteroarenes on alkenes activated by allenyl PdII species.

Catalytic diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective conjugate addition of chiral secondary borylalkyl copper species derived from borylalkenes in&#8197;situ to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated diesters provides enantioenriched alkylboron compounds containing two contiguous carbon stereogenic centers in good yield with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective conjugate addition of chiral secondary borylalkyl copper species derived from borylalkenes in&#8197;situ to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated diesters. In the presence of a chiral bisphosphine&#8208;ligated CuH catalyst, the conjugate addition provides a direct access to enantioenriched alkylboron compounds containing two contiguous carbon stereogenic centers in good yield with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;98:2 dr, &gt;99:1 er) by assembling readily available starting alkenyl reagents in a single operation without using preformed organometallic reagents or chiral auxiliaries. The resulting products were used in various organic transformations. The utility of the synthetic approach was highlighted by the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;phaseolinic acid.

The first enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cyclobutenone has been developed. The 3&#8208;methoxycarbonyl group shows a remarkable effect on stability and reactivity. Based on an enantioenriched adduct, the total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;kingianin&#8197;F was completed.







Abstract
Cyclobutenone has been used as a highly reactive dienophile in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, however, no enantioselective example has been reported. We disclose herein a chiral oxazaborolidine&#8208;aluminum bromide catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 3&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl cyclobutenone with a variety of dienes. Furthermore, a total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;kingianin&#8197;F was completed for the first time via enantioenriched cycloadduct bicyclo[4.2.0]octane derivative.

         <title>A Stable [4,3]Peri&#8208;acene Diradicaloid: Synthesis, Structure, and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4464-4469, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable derivative of [4,3]peri&#8208;acene with three rows of peri&#8208;fused tetracenes was isolated in crystalline form. It exhibits a unique structure with eight localized Clar's sextets and shows a large diradical character (94.8&#8201;%) as well as a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#8722;0.57&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1).







Abstract
The synthesis of peri&#8208;fused acenes (peri&#8208;acenes) with two or more rows is challenging due to their intrinsic open&#8208;shell diradical character. Herein, we report the isolation of a derivative (4) of [4,3]peri&#8208;acene in crystalline form. The parent [4,3]peri&#8208;acene, containing three rows of tetracene, has a large diradical character (y0=94.8&#8201;%) originating from aromatic stabilization. Due to kinetic blocking, 4 showed a reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of &#8776;157&#8197;h under ambient conditions. Its structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and bond&#8208;length analysis revealed eight localized Clar's sextets. 4 exhibited an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a narrow electrochemical energy gap (1.13&#8197;eV) and a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#8722;0.57&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 from SQUID measurements). Its electronic properties are compared with previously reported peri&#8208;tetracene and teranthene derivatives.

         <title>Glucose Binding Drives Reconfiguration of a Dynamic Library of Urea&#8208;Containing Metal&#8211;Organic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4485-4490, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic library including an FeII4L6 irregular structure and three FeII2L3 stereoisomers was formed by subcomponent self&#8208;assembly. Glucose amplifies the formation of the (P)&#8208;FeII2L3 helicate, which in turn amplifies &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose at the expense of the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;anomer. Both host and guest libraries are thus geared together into a single system during equilibration.







Abstract
A bis&#8208;urea&#8208;functionalized ditopic subcomponent assembled with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and FeII, resulting in a dynamic library of metal&#8211;organic assemblies: an irregular FeII4L6 structure and three FeII2L3 stereoisomers: left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helicates and a meso&#8208;structure. This library reconfigured in response to the addition of monosaccharide derivatives, which served as guests for specific library members, and the rate of saccharide mutarotation was also enhanced by the library. The (P) enantiomer of the FeII2L3 helical structure bound &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose selectively over &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose. As a consequence, the library collapsed into the (P)&#8208;FeII2L3 helicate following glucose addition. The &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose was likewise transformed into the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;anomer during equilibration and binding. Thus, &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose and (P)&#8208;3 amplified each other in the product mixture, as metal&#8211;organic and saccharide libraries geared together into a single equilibrating system.

         <title>Enantioselective Addition of &#945;&#8208;Nitroesters to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4599-4603, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to alkynes affords access to &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors containing contiguous stereocenters. These motifs can be further transformed into &#945;&#8208;amino esters without stereoablation.







Abstract
By using Rh&#8211;H catalysis, we couple &#945;&#8208;nitroesters and alkynes to prepare &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors. This atom&#8208;economical strategy generates two contiguous stereocenters, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. In this transformation, the alkyne undergoes isomerization to generate a RhIII&#8211;&#960;&#8208;allyl electrophile, which is trapped by an &#945;&#8208;nitroester nucleophile. A subsequent reduction with In powder transforms the allylic &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to the corresponding &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Nitrate via the Oxidation of Nitrogen on Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Porous Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4474-4478, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile&#8208;strained palladium porous nanosheets exhibited enhanced activity for nitrogen electrooxidation to nitrate at ambient conditions. 15N isotope labeling experiments showed that nitrate originated from nitrogen electrooxidation. Electrochemical in&#8197;situ characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the tensile strain could facilitate the formation of PdO2 active species and lead to high activity.







Abstract
Nitrate is one of the essential raw ingredients in agriculture and industry. The electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is promising to replace the conventional nitrate synthesis industry with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Here, tensile&#8208;strained palladium porous nanosheets (Pd&#8208;s PNSs) were prepared. They exhibited enhanced activity for electrochemical NOR at ambient conditions, greatly outperforming Pd nanosheets. 15N isotope labeling experiments proved that nitrate originated from nitrogen oxidation. Combining electrochemical in&#8197;situ Raman and FTIR spectroscopy with density functional calculations, it was revealed that the tensile strain could facilitate the formation of NOR active species of PdO2, leading to high activity.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Non&#8208;Classical 2&#8208;Norbornyl Cation in Confined Zeolites at Ambient Temperature</title>

In situ observation of non&#8208;classical 2&#8208;norbornyl cation inside confined zeolite channels by taking advantage of AIMD simulations as well as 13C ssNMR experiments without super acidic environments at ambient temperature is described.







Abstract
Carbonium ions are an important class of reaction intermediates, but their dynamic evolution is difficult to be monitored by in situ techniques under experimental conditions because of their extremely short lifetime. Probably the most famous case is 2&#8208;norbornyl cation (2NB+): its existing form (classical or non&#8208;classical) had been debated for decades, until the concrete proof of non&#8208;classical geometry was achieved by X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization at ultra&#8208;low temperature (40&#8197;K) and super acidic environment. However, we lack the understanding about 2NB+ at ambient conditions. Herein, by taking advantage of the confinement effect and delocalized acidic environment of zeolites, we successfully stabilized 2NB+ and unequivocally confirmed its &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221; structure inside the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and 13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. It is the first time to in situ observe the non&#8208;classical 2NB+ without the super acidic environment at ambient temperature, which provides a new strategy to expand the carbocation chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbonium ions are an important class of reaction intermediates, but their dynamic evolution is difficult to be monitored by in situ techniques under experimental conditions because of their extremely short lifetime. Probably the most famous case is 2&#8208;norbornyl cation (2NB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;): its existing form (classical or non&#8208;classical) had been debated for decades, until the concrete proof of non&#8208;classical geometry was achieved by X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization at ultra&#8208;low temperature (40&#8197;K) and super acidic environment. However, we lack the understanding about 2NB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at ambient conditions. Herein, by taking advantage of the confinement effect and delocalized acidic environment of zeolites, we successfully stabilized 2NB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and unequivocally confirmed its &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221; structure inside the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite by &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; molecular dynamics simulations and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. It is the first time to in situ observe the non&#8208;classical 2NB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; without the super acidic environment at ambient temperature, which provides a new strategy to expand the carbocation chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component interrupted Kinugasa reaction has been developed. Diverse chiral sulfur functional chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams with two consecutive stereogenic centers were synthesized in one step in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity from easily available materials.







Abstract
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric, three&#8208;component interrupted Kinugasa reaction has been developed. Diverse chiral sulfur&#8208;containing chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams with two consecutive stereogenic centers were synthesized in one step from readily available starting materials in good yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The key is the interception of in situ formed chiral four membered copper(I) enolate intermediate with sulfur electrophiles.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Enantioselective Synthesis of Pyrroline Derivatives by a Radical/Polar Cascade Reaction</title>

An atom&#8208;economical strategy has been developed for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven synthesis of enantioenriched substituted 1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives with wide functional&#8208;group tolerance (see scheme). In this enantioselective radical approach, stereoselectivity was dictated by coordination to a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;rhodium catalyst, and water was produced as the only by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Herein, a light&#8208;driven, atom&#8208;economical process that provides access to enantiomerically enriched substituted chiral 1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives is introduced. The strategy involves the distal functionalization of acyl heterocycles through a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) process and the use of tailor&#8208;made ketimines as reliable electrophilic partners. This transformation is translated into an enantiomerically controlled radical/polar cascade reaction in which water is produced as the sole by&#8208;product and stereoselectivity is dictated by coordination to a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;rhodium catalyst.

         <title>Acyl Donor Intermediates in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis: Acyl Azolium or Azolium Enolate?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 9, Page 4507-4511, February 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetyl azolium enolates resulted from the treatment of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes IPr and SIPr with 2&#8208;propenyl acetate. Protonation converts them into acetyl azolium cations. The latter react with amines faster than with alcohols, while the azolium enolates reacted readily with alcohols, but sluggishly with amines. The use of a d3&#8208;acetyl azolium triflate indicated that alcohol acetylation occurs at the azolium enolate stage.







Abstract
Azolium enolates and acyl azolium cations have been proposed as intermediates in numerous N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed transformations. Acetyl azolium enolates were generated from the reaction of 2&#8208;propenyl acetate with both saturated (SIPr) and aromatic (IPr) NHCs, isolated, and characterized (NMR, XRD). Protonation with triflic acid gave the corresponding acetyl azolium triflates which were isolated and characterized (NMR, XRD). Acyl azolium cations have been proposed as immediate precursors of the ester product, for example, in the redox esterification of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;enals. Studies with d3&#8208;acetyl azolium triflate suggest that ester formation originates instead from an azolium enolate intermediate. Furthermore, the acetyl azolium enolate selectively reacted with alcohol nucleophiles in the presence of amines. While the acetyl azolium cation did not react with alcohols, an ester&#8208;selective reaction was induced by addition of base, by intermediate formation of the acetyl azolium enolate.

         <title>An Acidity&#8208;Unlocked Nanoplatform Enables Self&#8208;Boosting ROS Generation through Upregulation of Lactate for Highly Specific Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodynamic therapy is an emerging tumor therapeutic strategy. However, the anticancer effects are greatly limited by the strong acidity requirements for effective Fenton&#8208;like reaction, and the inevitably &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity. Herein, we develop acidity&#8208;unlocked nanoplatform (FePt@FeOx@TAM&#8208;PEG) that can accurately perform the high&#8208;efficient and tumor&#8208;specific catalysis for anticancer treatment, through dual pathway of cyclic amplification strategy. Notably, the pH&#8208;responsive peculiarity of tamoxifen (TAM) drug allows for the catalytic activity of FePt@FeOx  to be &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; in acidic tumor microenvironments, while keeping silence in neutral condition. Importantly, the released TAM within cancer cells is able to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, leading to the upregulated lactate content and thereby the accumulated intracellular H+  , which can overcome the intrinsically insufficient acidity of tumor. Through the positive feedback loop, large amount of active FePt@FeOx  nanocatalyzers are released and able to access to the endogenous H2O2  , exerting the improved Fenton&#8208;like reaction within the more acidic condition. Finally, such smart nanoplatform enables self&#8208;boosting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces strong intracellular oxidative stress, leading to the substantial anticancer outcomes  in vivo  , which may provide a new insight for tumor&#8208;specific cascade catalytic therapy and reducing the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity to surrounding normal tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ synthesis of uranyl&#8208;imprinted nanocage for selective uranium recovery from seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adaptive coordination structure is vital for selective uranium extraction from seawater. By strategy of molecular imprinting, uranyl is introduced into the&#160; m ultivariate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) during the synthesis process to guide the&#160;  in&#8208;situ  &#160;construction of proper nanocage structure for targeting uranyl binding. Except for  &#160;the&#160;  coordination  between uranium with four oxygen from the materials, the axial oxygen of uranyl also forms hydrogen bonds with hydrogen from the phenolic hydroxyl group, which enhances the binding affinity of the material to uranyl. Attributing to the high binding affinity, the adsorbent shows high uranium binding selectivity to uranyl against not only the interfering metal ions, but also the carbonate group that coordinates with uranyl to form [UO  2  (CO)  3  ]  4 &#8722;  &#160;in seawater. In natural seawater, the adsorbent realizes a high uranium adsorption capacity of 7.35 mg g  &#8722;1  ,&#160;t ogether with an 18.38 times higher selectivity to vanadium.&#160; Integrated into account the high reusability, this adsorbent is a promising alternative for uranium recovery from seawater</dc:description>

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Mediated Rapid and Sensitive Surface Etching of Gold Nanostars for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodide&#8208;mediated surface etching can tailor the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanostars through etching of the high&#8208;energy facets of the nanoparticle protrusions in a rapid and sensitive way. By exploring the underlying mechanisms of this etching and the key parameters influencing it (e.g., iodide, oxygen, pH and temperature), we show its potential in a sensitive biosensing system. Horseradish peroxidase&#8208;catalysed oxidation of iodide enables control of the etching of gold nanostars to spherical gold nanoparticles, where the resulting spectral shift in the surface plasmon resonance yields a distinct colour change of the solution. We further develop this enzyme&#8208;modulated surface etching of gold nanostars into a versatile platform for plasmonic immunoassays, where a high sensitivity is possible by signal amplification via magnetic beads and click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of the Physical Virus Titer and Purity by Ultrasensitive Flow Virometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid quantification of viruses is vital for basic research on viral diseases as well as clinical application of virus&#8208;based products. Here, we report the development of a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;particle method to enumerate intact viral particles by ultrasensitive flow virometry, which detects single viruses as small as 27 nm in diameter. The nucleic acid dye SYTO 82 was used to stain the viral (or vector) genome, and a laboratory&#8208;built nano&#8208;flow cytometer (nFCM) was employed to simultaneously detect the side&#8208;scatter and fluorescence signals of individual viral particles. Using the bacteriophage T7 as a model system, intact virions were completely discriminated from empty capsids and naked viral genomes. Successful measurement of the physical virus titer and purity was demonstrated for recombinant adenoviruses, which could be used for gene delivery, therapeutic products derived from phage cocktails, and infected cell supernatants for veterinary vaccine production.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Plasticity of Cyclic Ras&#8208;Inhibitor Peptides Defines Cell Permeabilization Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational plasticity defines cell permeabilization activity: Cell permeabilization activities of cyclic Ras&#8208;inhibitor peptides are determined by the ability to adopt a cell&#8208;permeable amphipathic conformation, in which aromatic residues (green) are converged on one side and the Arg residues (blue) surrounds the aromatic residues, in a low polarity environment.







Abstract
Cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 are 11&#8208;mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras&#8208;Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;like motif; however, only cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell&#8208;based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three&#8208;dimensional structures of cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin&#8197;9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino&#8208;acid sidechains, Tle&#8208;2 and dVal&#8208;3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.

         <title>Transformable Honeycomb&#8208;Like Nanoassemblies of Carbon Dots for Regulated Multisite Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts&#8208;responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots are fabricated to program the sequential and spatiotemporal release of multiple therapeutic agents for synergetic chemoimmunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Tumor fibrotic stroma forms complex barriers for therapeutic nanomedicine. Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems. Herein, we report the development of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots (CDs) to spatially program the delivery of multiple therapeutics for enhanced antitumor chemoimmunotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic enhancer (Fe ions) are immobilized on the surface of CDs, whereas tumor microenvironment modifier (losartan, LOS) is encapsulated within the mesopores. The drugs&#8208;loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses. Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that the nanoassemblies exhibit effective T cells infiltration, tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis prevention, thereby providing a therapeutic platform for desmoplasia solid tumor.

         <title>Site Sensitivity of Interfacial Charge Transfer and Photocatalytic Efficiency in Photocatalysis: Methanol Oxidation on Anatase TiO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface sites and resulting methanol adsorbates strongly affect the surface band bending/bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface charge migration processes and the interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes, and consequently play a key role in the photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methanol on various anatase TiO2 nanocrystals was studied by in&#8197;situ and time&#8208;resolved characterizations and DFT calculations. Surface site and resulting surface adsorbates affect the surface band bending/bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface charge migration processes and interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes. TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets expose a high density of reactive fourfold&#8208;coordinated Ti sites (Ti4c) at which CH3OH molecules dissociate to form the CH3O adsorbate (CH3O(a)Ti4c). CH3O(a)Ti4c localized density of states are almost at the valence band maximum of TiO2 surface, facilitating the interfacial hole transfer process; CH3O(a)Ti4c with a high coverage promotes upward surface band bending, facilitating bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface hole migration. CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation rate constant. TiO2 nanocrystals enclosed by the {001} facets are most active in photocatalytic methanol oxidation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Dynamic DNA&#8208;Origami&#8208;Based Plasmonic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial configuration and optical properties of non&#8208;photoresponsive DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based plasmonic assemblies can be controlled with light using a photoresponsive medium. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium's pH decreases, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links in the plasmonic assemblies, leading to their spatial reconfiguration, which can be reversed by turning the light off.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA&#8208;based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Herein, we describe the remote manipulation of native (non&#8208;photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine&#8208;based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic, remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.

         <title>Surface Functionalized Sensors for Humidity&#8208;Independent Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface functionalization strategy, utilizing Co&#8208;MOF/PDMS as tandem coating layers, was proposed to overcome the problem of humidity sensitivity for semiconducting metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based gas sensors. This approach can be extended to various humidity&#8208;independent gas&#8208;sensing materials.







Abstract
Semiconducting metal oxides (SMOXs) are used widely for gas sensors. However, the effect of ambient humidity on the baseline and sensitivity of the chemiresistors is still a largely unsolved problem, reducing sensor accuracy and causing complications for sensor calibrations. Presented here is a general strategy to overcome water&#8208;sensitivity issues by coating SMOXs with a hydrophobic polymer separated by a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer that preserves the SMOX surface and serves a gas&#8208;selective function. Sensor devices using these nanoparticles display near&#8208;constant responses even when humidity is varied across a wide range [0&#8211;90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH)]. Furthermore, the sensor delivers notable performance below 20&#8201;% RH whereas other water&#8208;resistance strategies typically fail. Selectivity enhancement and humidity&#8208;independent sensitivity are concomitantly achieved using this approach. The reported tandem coating strategy is expected to be relevant for a wide range of SMOXs, leading to a new generation of gas sensors with excellent humidity&#8208;resistant performance.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Component Self&#8208;Assembly of a Giant Heterometallic Polyoxotungstate Supercluster with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hierarchical aggregation of molecular nanostructures from multiple components is a grand synthetic challenge, which requires highly selective linkage control. Here, we demonstrate how two orthogonal linkage groups, i.e. organotin and lanthanide cations, can be used to drive the aggregation of a giant molecular metal oxide superstructure. The title compound {[(Sn(CH3)2)2O]4{[CeW5O18] [TeW4O16][CeSn(CH3)2]4[TeW8O31]4}2}46&#8211; (1a) features dimensions of ca. 2.2 &#215; 2.3 &#215; 3.4 nm3 and a molecular weight of ca. 25 kDa. Structural analysis shows the hierarchical aggregation from several independent sub&#8208;units. Initial biomedical tests show that 1 features an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells based on an apoptosis pathway. In vivo experiments in mice reveal the anti&#8208;proliferative activity of 1 and open new paths for further development of this new compound class.</dc:description>

         <title>Architecting inorganic crown&#8208;ethers by s&#8208;block&#8208;metal templated Si&#8208;O bond activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report the synthesis, structures, coordination ability and formation mechanism of silicon analogs of crown&#8208;ethers. An oligomerization of 2D2 (I) (2Dn, = (Me4Si2O)n) was achieved by the reaction with GaI3 and MIx (M = Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr). In these reactions the metal cations serve as template and the anions (I&#8210;/GaI4&#8210;) are required as nucleophiles. In case of MIx = LiI, [Li(2D3)GaI4] (1) is formed. In case of MIx = NaI, MgI2, CaI2 and SrI2 the compounds [M(2D4)(GaI4)x] (M = Mg2+ (3), Ca2+ (4), Sr2+ (5) are obtained. Furthermore the proton complex [H(2D3)][Ga2I7] (6) was isolated and structurally characterized. All complexes were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, DOSY experiments and except for compound 3, also by means of SC&#8208;XRD. Solid&#8208;state structures compare well with observations made in solution proving that these inorganic crown&#8208;ethers are stable as long as a metal ion is present. A crucial step for the formation of such poly&#8208;silylethers is an exocyclic pre&#8208;coordination of I with Mn+ which is evident from the obtained intermediate [Li2(2D2)(GaI4)2] (II) product in the reaction of I with LiGaI4. Therein a Si&#8208;O bond activation is observed since elongated Si&#8208;O bonds and smaller Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si angles are found in II compared to I. The metal cations can be readily removed from the obtained macrocycles upon MeCN addition. Using 4 as an example, we show that free ligands can in principle be obtained, but NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric studies reveal that even higher oligomers are formed as soon as the metal template is removed. 2D4 (7) is obtained as the main product followed by 2D5 (8) and 2D6 (9). Quantum chemical calculations were carried out to compare the M+ affinity of the crown&#8208;ether analogs among themselves and with respect to crown ethers and to shed light on the formation of larger rings from smaller ones, in particular concerning the role of M+ and I&#8722;.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution on Two&#8208;Dimensional Layered Lead Iodide Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites perform photocatalytic H2 production more efficiently than their 3D counterparts in spite of the higher exciton binding energy and inferior light absorption. The length of the organic cations of 2D perovskites influences the optoelectronic and charge transfer properties, and the perovskite with the shortest organic cation length achieved the benchmark solar energy conversion efficiency.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated excellent capability in solar fuel production, while the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) counterparts are generally considered inferior candidates due to the high exciton binding energy and weak light absorption. Herein, contrary to our common understanding, we find that 2D perovskites can perform photocatalytic H2 production from HI splitting more efficiently than their 3D counterparts. We observed sharp difference between 2D perovskites crystals with organic phenylalkylammonium cations of different lengths and the 3D counterparts in their stabilization behavior in aqueous solution. Moreover, we show that the organic cations length of the 2D perovskites affects the nanostructures, optoelectronic properties, and the charge transfer process significantly, which determines the photocatalytic activity of the 2D perovskites. Among the 2D perovskites under investigation, phenylmethylammonium lead iodide with the shortest organic cations achieved the best solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of ca. 1.57&#8201;%, which is the highest value ever reported for hybrid perovskites.

         <title>Tracking Reactions of Asymmetric Organo&#8208;Osmium Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysts in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This chiral organo&#8208;osmium complex catalyses enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cancer cells. The bromine tag on the chelated ligand and osmium have been jointly mapped in cells by X&#8208;ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, revealing facile displacement of the ligand and its translocation to the nucleus.







Abstract
Most metallodrugs are prodrugs that can undergo ligand exchange and redox reactions in biological media. Here we have investigated the cellular stability of the anticancer complex [OsII[(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(RR/SS&#8208;MePh&#8208;DPEN)] [1] (MePh&#8208;DPEN=tosyl&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine) which catalyses the enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cells. The introduction of a bromide tag at an unreactive site on a phenyl substituent of Ph&#8208;DPEN allowed us to probe the fate of this ligand and Os in human cancer cells by a combination of X&#8208;ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping and inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). The BrPh&#8208;DPEN ligand is readily displaced by reaction with endogenous thiols and translocated to the nucleus, whereas the Os fragment is exported from the cells. These data explain why the efficiency of catalysis is low, and suggests that it could be optimised by developing thiol resistant analogues. Moreover, this work also provides a new way for the delivery of ligands which are inactive when administered on their own.

&lt;p&gt;This chiral organo&#8208;osmium complex catalyses enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cancer cells. The bromine tag on the chelated ligand and osmium have been jointly mapped in cells by X&#8208;ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, revealing facile displacement of the ligand and its translocation to the nucleus.

         <title>A Macromolecular Drug for Cancer Therapy via Extracellular Calcification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macromolecular drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), was developed by Ruikang Tang, Ben Wang and co&#8208;workers as an extracellular chemotherapy drug involving biomineralization for malignant tumor diseases in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016122). The new type of drug combines with folate receptor and selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells via absorbing calcium from the blood, resulting in the pathological calcification of tumors. Administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibits tumor growth and dramatically improved the survival rates of mice.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Turing patterns have been widely seen in living systems. Nevertheless, the synthesis of chemical Turing&#8208;type structures in inorganic nanomaterials remains a huge challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202017016), Min&#8208;Rui Gao and co&#8208;workers constructed stationary Ag2Se Turing patterns on CoSe2 nanobelts via diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The new material consists of abundant Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, which are active sites that allow for favorable chemisorption of surface oxygenated species, leading to enhanced energetics for oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>First Hole&#8208;Storage Enhanced a&#8208;Si Photocathodes for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated as an effective interfacial layer for photoanodes to achieve outstanding photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance for water oxidation reaction owing to its unique hole&#8208;storage function. However, it is unknown whether such a hole&#8208;storage layer can be used to construct highly efficient photocathodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we report Fh interfacial engineering of amorphous silicon photocathode (with nickel as HER cocatalyst) achieving a photocurrent density of 15.6 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode and a half&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 4.08%, which represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for PEC hydrogen production over a&#8208;Si based photocathodes in alkaline solution. Besides, the photocurrent density is maintained above 14 mA cm  &#8208;2  for 170 min with 100% Faradic efficiency for HER in alkaline solution. Our results demonstrate a feasible approach to construct efficient photocathodes via the application of a hole&#8208;storage layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Semiconducting Behavior in a Large Mixed&#8208;Valent Uranium(V/VI) Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uranium based materials recently received substantial attentions in catalysis, superconductivity and magnetism due to integration of unique 5f electron configurations and bonding involvement. Herein, for the first time, we disclose the intrinsic semiconducting properties of one of the largest mixed&#8208;valent uranium clusters, [H3O+][UV(UVIO2)8(&#956;3&#8208;O)6(PhCOO)2(Py(CH2O)2)4(DMF)4] (Ph = phenyl, Py = pyridyl, DMF = N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide) (1). Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrates that U(V) center is stabilized within a tetraoxo core surrounded by eight uranyl (VI) pentagonal bipyramidal centers. The oxidation states of uranium are substantiated by spectroscopic data and magnetic susceptibility measurement. Electronic spectroscopy and theoretical investigations corroborate that U(V) species serve as electron donors and thus facilitate 1 being a n&#8208;type semiconductor. With the largest effective atomic number among all reported radiation&#8208;detection semiconductor materials, charge transport properties and photoconductivity were further investigated under X&#8208;ray excitation for 1, showing a large on&#8208;off ratio of 500 and considerable charge mobility lifetime product of 2.3&#215;10&#8208;4 cm2/V, as well as a high detection sensitivity of 23.4 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Tertiary Alkylation of Terminal Alkynes with 1,3&#8208;Diesters via a Functionalized Alkyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct oxidative C(sp)&#8722;H/C(sp  3  )&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling offers an ideal and environmentally benign protocol for C(sp)&#8722;C(sp  3  ) bond formations. As such, reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity with respect to C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bond cleavage have remained a persistent challenge. Herein is reported a simple method for iron&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;mediated tertiary alkylation of terminal alkynes with readily available and versatile 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The reaction is suitable for an array of substrates and proceeds in a highly selective manner even employing alkanes containing other tertiary, benzylic, and C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds alpha to heteroatoms. Elaboration of the products enables the synthesis of a series of versatile building blocks. Control experiments implicate the in situ generation of a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical species.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Field Induced Modulation of Charge&#8208;Recombination Dynamics in a Rosarin&#8208;Fullerene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;recombination processes are critical for photovoltaic applications and should be suppressed for efficient charge transport. Here, we report that an applied magnetic field (0&#8211;1 T) can be used control the charge&#8208;recombination dynamics in an expanded rosarin&#8208;C  60  complex. In the low magnetic field regime (&lt; 100 mT), the charge&#8208;recombination rate slows down due to hyperfine coupling, as inferred from transient absorption spectroscopic analyses. In contrast, in the high field regime, i.e., over 500 mT, the charge&#8208;recombination rate recovers and increases because the &#916;g mechanism facilitates spin conversion to a triplet charge&#8208;separated state (S to T  0  ) that undergoes rapid charge&#8208;recombination to a localized rosarin triplet state. Therefore, we highlight the charge&#8208;recombination rate and the localized triplet state population can be modulated by the magnetic field in charge donor/acceptor non&#8208;covalent complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of in&#8208;cell and in&#8208;vitro crowding on the conformations and dynamics of an intrinsically disordered protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformations and dynamics of proteins can be influenced by crowding from the large concentrations of macromolecules within cells. We recently showed that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit chain compaction in crowded solutions in vitro, but, surprisingly, no such effects were observed in cultured mammalian cells. Here, to increase intracellular crowding, we reduced the cell volume by hyperosmotic stress and used an IDP as a crowding sensor for in&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy. In these more crowded cells, the IDP exhibits compaction, slower chain dynamics, and much slower translational diffusion, indicating a pronounced concentration and length&#8208;scale dependence of crowding. In vitro, these effects cannot be reproduced with small but only with large polymeric crowders. The observations can be explained with polymer theory and depletion interactions and indicate that IDPs can diffuse much more efficiently through a crowded cytosol than a globular protein of similar dimensions, which may facilitate the target search important for many IDP functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming a Fluorochrome to an Efficient Photocatalyst for Oxidative Hydroxylation: A Supramolecular Dimerization Strategy Based on Host&#8208;Enhanced Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of non&#8208;covalent synthetic strategy to fabricate efficient photocatalysts is of great importance in theranostic and organic materials. Herein, a fluorochrome N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylated dipyridinium thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole diiodide (MPT) was transformed into an efficient photocatalyst through supramolecular dimerization in the cavity of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]). The host&#8208;enhanced charge transfer interaction within the supramolecular dimer 2MPT&#8208;CB[8] dramatically promoted intersystem crossing to produce triplet. In addition, the staggered conformation of 2MPT&#8208;CB[8] facilitated the energy transfer and electron transfer of the triplet. As a result, 2MPT&#8208;CB[8] could serve as a high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. This supramolecular dimerization strategy enriches the supramolecular engineering of functional &#960;&#8208;systems. It is anticipated that this strategy can be extended to fabricate various &#960;&#8208;systems with tailor&#8208;made functions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Acidities of Nucleophilic Monofluoromethylation Reagents: An Anomalous &#945;&#8208;Fluorine Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the Periodic Table. Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is expected to lower the p  K  a  of neighboring functionality via its strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, and this strategy has been widely exploited in diverse disciplines. Herein, we report a striking anomalous  a  &#8208;fluorine substitution effect on the  a  &#8208;C  sp3  &#8211;H acidity. We have experimentally measured the p  K  a  values of a series of popular nucleophilic monofluoromethylating reagents  a  &#8208;fluoro(phenylsulfonyl)methane derivatives as well as their C&#8208;H analogs by Bordwell&#8217;s overlapping indicator method in dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Contrary to expectations, we found that  a  &#8208;fluorine substituent does not generally enhance but rather weaken the  a  &#8208;C  sp3  &#8211;H acidity of most (phenylsulfonyl)methane derivatives. DFT computations reproduce and provide insight into the anomalous  a  &#8208;fluorine effect. A reasonable correlation was identified between the C&#8211;H  p  K  a  of (phenylsulfonyl)methane derivatives and Mayr&#8217;s nucleophilicity parameter (  N  ) of the corresponding carbanions.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether Functionalized Potassium&#8208;Responsive Anionocages for Cascaded Guest Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In many critical biological processes, the host&#8208;guest chemistry of protein receptors is regulated by effector molecules to realize cascaded delivery of messenger molecules between different targets. Mimicking these natural processes with artificial receptors remains a challenge. Herein, we report a success of cascaded guest delivery between two anionocages (anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven cages), in a reversible manner,&#160;wherein binding of K  +  ions by a crown ether functionalized, heteroleptic A  2  L  3  (A = anion, L = ligand) anionocage triggers the release and delivery of a TEA  +  (tetraethylammonium) guest to another A  2  L  3  anionocage that is a weaker and less K  +  &#8208;sensitive receptor. Elimination of the K  +  with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand enables recapture of the TEA  +  by the crown ether functionalized anionocage and thus realizes a reversed guest delivery. Moreover, integrative self&#8208;sorting of anionocages is firstly reported, leading to heteroleptic cages with enhanced guest binding affinities, which plays a critical role in driving the process of cascaded guest delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of O&#8208;Heteroacenes by Ladderization of Fluorinated Oligophenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;heteroacenes are now available by a one&#8208;step LOOP reaction by SET&#8208;induced SNAr&#8208;radical de&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation&#8208;SNAr. tBuOK serves as a reliable oxygen atom source and O2&#8722; synthon, enabling synthesis of dibenzofuran, benzoxanthenes, and benzooxepines, and a range of longer ladder&#8208;type O&#8208;heteroacenes from fluorinated oligophenylenes.







Abstract
A novel catalyst&#8208;free approach to benzoannulated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles from fluorinated oligophenylenes is reported. Unlike existing methods, the presented reaction does not require an oxygen&#8208;containing precursor and relies on an external oxygen source, potassium tert&#8208;butoxide, which serves as an O2&#8722; synthon. The radical nature of the reaction facilitates nucleophilic substitution even in the presence of strong electron&#8208;donating groups and enables de&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation required for the complete annulation. Also demonstrated is the applicability of the method to introduce five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered rings containing oxygen, whereas multiple annulations also open up a short synthetic path to ladder&#8208;type O&#8208;heteroacenes and oligodibenzofurans.

         <title>Flow Technology for Telescoped Generation, Lithiation and Electrophilic (C3) Functionalization of Highly Strained 1&#8208;Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strained&#8230;.in Flow! The first telescoped continuous flow protocol for the generation, lithiation, and electrophilic trapping of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane is reported. Several structurally unique C3&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes were prepared using this strategy starting from readily available starting materials.







Abstract
Strained compounds are privileged moieties in modern synthesis. In this context, 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are appealing structural motifs that can be employed as click reagents or precursors to azetidines. We herein report the first telescoped continuous flow protocol for the generation, lithiation, and electrophilic trapping of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The flow method allows for exquisite control of the reaction parameters, and the process operates at higher temperatures and safer conditions with respect to batch mode. The efficiency of this intramolecular cyclization/C3&#8208;lithiation/electrophilic quenching flow sequence is documented with more than 20 examples.

         <title>Formation Mechanisms for Phosphorene and SnIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D&#8208;SnIP and 2D&#8208;phosphorene are formed in a gas phase reaction of gaseous white phosphorus (P4) and SnI2 via P4 activation followed by successive helix or layer growth. P4 activation takes place by Sn2I4 dimers attracting the P&#8197;lone pairs (SnIP) or direct SnI2 insertion in a P&#8722;P bond (phosphorene). Both reaction mechanisms were studied between 0&#8197;K and synthesis temperature.







Abstract
Phosphorene&#8212;the monolayered material of the element allotrope black phosphorus (Pblack)&#8212;and SnIP are 2D and 1D semiconductors with intriguing physical properties. Pblack and SnIP have in common that they can be synthesized via short way transport or mineralization using tin, tin(IV) iodide and amorphous red phosphorus. This top&#8208;down approach is the most important access route to phosphorene. The two preparation routes are closely connected and differ mainly in reaction temperature and molar ratios of starting materials. Many speculative intermediates or activator side phases have been postulated especially for top&#8208;down Pblack/phosphorene synthesis, such as Hittorf's phosphorus or Sn24P19.3I8 clathrate. The importance of phosphorus&#8208;based 2D and 1D materials for energy conversion, storage, and catalysis inspired us to elucidate the formation mechanisms of these two compounds. Herein, we report on the reaction mechanisms of Pblack/phosphorene and SnIP from P4 and SnI2 via direct gas phase formation.

         <title>A Pseudotetrahedral Terminal Oxoiron(IV) Complex: Mechanistic Promiscuity in C&#8722;H bond Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reactive S=2 pseudotetrahedral oxoiron(IV) complex 2 supported by a sterically demanding 1,4,7&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane ligand has been synthesized and spectroscopically characterized as one of the best electronic and functional models for a biological oxoiron(IV) intermediate of taurine dioxygenase (TauD&#8208;J).







Abstract
S=2 oxoiron(IV) species act as reactive intermediates in the catalytic cycle of nonheme iron oxygenases. The few available synthetic S=2 FeIV=O complexes known to date are often limited to trigonal bipyramidal and very rarely to octahedral geometries. Herein we describe the generation and characterization of an S=2 pseudotetrahedral FeIV=O complex 2 supported by the sterically demanding 1,4,7&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane ligand. Complex 2 is a very potent oxidant in hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactions with large non&#8208;classical deuterium kinetic isotope effects, suggesting hydrogen tunneling contributions. For sterically encumbered substrates, direct HAA is impeded and an alternative oxidative asynchronous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism prevails, which is unique within the nonheme oxoiron community. The high reactivity and the similar spectroscopic parameters make 2 one of the best electronic and functional models for a biological oxoiron(IV) intermediate of taurine dioxygenase (TauD&#8208;J).

         <title>Genome mining based discovery of the cyclic peptide tolypamide and TolF, a Ser/Thr forward O&#8208;prenyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanobactins comprise a widespread group of peptide metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that are often diversified by post&#8208;translational prenylation. Several enzymes have been identified in cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways that carry out chemically diverse prenylation reactions, representing a resource for the discovery of post&#8208;translational alkylating agents. Here, genome mining was used to identify orphan cyanobactin prenyltransferases, leading to isolation of tolypamide from the freshwater cyanobacterium,  Tolypothrix  sp.&#160;The structure of tolypamide was confirmed by spectroscopic methods, degradation, and enzymatic total synthesis. Tolypamide is forward prenylated on a threonine residue, representing an unprecedented post&#8208;translational modification. Biochemical characterization of cognate enzyme TolF revealed a prenyltransferase with strict selectivity for forward  O  &#8208;prenylation of serine or threonine, but with relaxed substrate selectivity for flanking peptide sequences. Since cyanobactin pathways often exhibit exceptionally broad substrate tolerance, these enzymes represent robust tools for synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most tumors have more severe hypoxia levels than normal tissues and tumor hypoxia is considered as a useful untapped target for cancer treatment. Here, we develop an effective oxygen delivery vehicle of polydopamine&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized oxygen microcapsules by interfacial polymerization. The oxygen microcapsules have excellent biocompatibility and are dispersed in aqueous solution. Oxygen could easily diffuse out from the microcapsules, thus increasing and maintaining the microenvironment at an oxygen&#8208;rich state. In vitro cell cultures confirm that oxygen microcapsules could effectively improve the hypoxia microenvironment, showing the lowest fluorescent intensity of hypoxia&#8208;green&#8208;labeled cells. When injected subcutaneously in vivo, oxygen microcapsules could also improve the tumor&#8217;s hypoxia microenvironment, thus suppressing the growth of tumor. Synergetic therapy using oxygen microcapsules and gemcitabine drugs proves to be an effective way for tumor treatment, showing the best performance in suppressing the tumor&#8217;s growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Tuning Electron Distribution of Single&#8208;atomic Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays a vital role for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, the NRR kinetics is still limited by the sluggish hydrogenation process on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a hybrid catalyst with atomic iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C) matrix of an inverse opal structure, leading to a remarkably high NH3 yield rate of 31.9 &#181;gNH3 h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat. and Faradaic efficiency of 11.8% at &#8208;0.4 V for NRR electrocatalysis, outperformed almost all previously reported atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the observed high NRR catalytic activity for the FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C catalyst stemmed mainly from the optimized charge&#8208;transfer between the adjacent O and Fe atoms homogenously distributed on the porous carbon support, which could not only significantly facilitate the transportation of N2 and ions but also effectively decrease the binding energy between the isolated Fe atom and *N2 intermediate and the thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (*N2 &#8594; *NNH). A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Zn&#8208;N2 battery with FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C as the cathode demonstrated the self&#8208;power capability to convert N2 into NH3 while delivering a power density of up to 4.5 mW cm&#8208;2 and an energy density of 692.9 Wh kg&#8208;1.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays a vital role for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Growth of Homogeneous High&#8208;density Horizontal SWNT Arrays on Sapphire via a Magnesium&#8208;assisted Catalyst Anchoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ  growth of high&#8208;density single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) arrays with homogeneity is highly desirable for integrated circuits. However, disastrous migration and aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles on substrate has greatly limited the area of as&#8208;grown SWNT arrays. Herein, we develop a magnesium&#8208;assisted catalyst anchoring strategy to restrain catalyst nanoparticles sintering on substrate. Magnesium modification ameliorates sapphire surface by high temperature solid reaction and thus provides a stronger metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). Hereby, we realize the direct growth of high&#8208;density SWNT arrays that fully cover an entire 10 x 10 mm  2  substrate with the local highest density of ~110 tubes mm  &#8208;1  using iron as catalyst. This strategy was also proven universal when employing solid carbide catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Microporous Polymers as Ultralong&#8208;Lived Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;air batteries have emerged as a new generation of green and safe battery, but current anodes mainly focus on limited choices of nonporous linear polymers, which usually suffer from inferior ion transfer and insufficient stability, thus constraining their development. Herein, we report a new redox donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated microporous polymer (AQ&#8208;CMP) by the C&#8208;C coupling of anthraquinone as A and benzene as D and demonstrate the first use of CMP materials as efficient ultralong&#8208;lived organic anodes for rechargeable air batteries. By constructing a D&#8208;A octupole interconnected network throughout the CMP skeleton, AQ&#8208;CMP is endowed with not only favorable electronic modulation for enhanced electron transport and n&#8208;doping activity compared to linear counterparts, but also high density of active sites for maximizing the formula&#8208;weight&#8208;based redox capability. This coupled with highly cross&#8208;linked and porous structure of CMP, leads to markedly&#8208;improved electrochemical performance. Thus, the CMP anode delivers a 96% theoretical capacity up to 202 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 A g&#8208;1 and retains 115 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1, along with a remarkable 100 % retention over 60000 charge/discharge cycles &#8211; superior to all reported polymer anodes. The assembled CMP&#8208;air full cell yields a stable and high capacity with full capacity recovery after only refreshing cathodes, while the decoupled electrolyte and cathode design boosts the discharge voltage and voltage efficiency to 1 V and 85.7%, surpassing those of the existing polymer&#8208;air batteries. This work highlights not only a new class of organic active anode but also a fresh design idea, which is anticipated to boost the development of polymer&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Allostery&#8208;Mimicking Self&#8208;assembly of Helical Poly(phenyacetylene) Block Copolymers and the Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allostery can regulate protein self&#8208;assembly which further affects biological acitivities, and achieving precise control over the chiral suprastructures during self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. Herein, to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins, the poly(phenyacetylene)s block copolymers PPA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to investigate their conformational&#8208;transition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. As the helical conformation of the block PsmNap spontaneously transforms from  cis&#8208;transiod  to  cis&#8208;cisoid,  the decreasing solubility of PsmNap blocks in THF induced self&#8208;assembly of PPA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PsmNap. The self&#8208;assembly structures of copolymers can sequentially evlove from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation. The screw sense of final helical strands was closely correlated to the helicity of the block PsmNap. This is helpful to understand the mechanism of allostery&#8208;modulated self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>A general supramolecular approach to regulate protein functions by cucurbit[7]uril and unnatural amino acid recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of specific protein function is of great importance for both research and therapeutic development. Many small or large molecules have been developed to control specific protein function, but there is a lack of a universal approach to regulate the function of any given protein. Herein, we report a general host&#8211;guest molecular recognition approach involving modification of the protein functional surfaces with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids bearing guest side chains that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril. Using two enzymes and a cytokine as models, we showed that the activity of proteins bearing unnatural amino acid could be turned off by host molecule binding, which blocked its functional binding surface. Protein activity can be switched back by treatment with a competitive guest molecule. Our approach provides a general tool for reversibly regulating protein function through molecular recognition and can be expected to be valuable for studying protein functions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Long and Reversibly Self&#8208;Assembling 1&#8208;D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1&#8208;dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G&#8208;quadruplexes. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a &#8220;monomeric&#8221; TQ Hybrid tile; followed by &#8220;sticky&#8221; TQ  s  tiles, incorporating unique guanine&#8208;only sticky ends, that enable efficient self&#8208;assembly via G&#8208;quartet formation of nanostructures &gt; 150 nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomer controlled switchable copolymerization: A feasible route for the functionalization of poly(lactide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switchable polymerization is an attractive strategy to enable the sequential selectivity of multi&#8208;block polyesters. Besides, these well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block polyesters could enable further modification for wider applications. Herein, based on the reversible insertion of CO  2  by Salen&#8208;Mn  III  , a new monomer controlled self&#8208;switchable polymerization route was developed. Chemoselective ring opening copolymerization of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) and lactide (LA) was explored without cocatalyst. The sequential conversion of OCAs and LA into the polymer chain could form multi&#8208;block polyesters. Based on this strategy, a series of multi&#8208;block polyesters with different pendant groups were synthesized. Furthermore, by modifying the propargyl&#8208;containing copolymers with quaternary ammonium groups, we have realized antibacterial functionalization of PLA. These results imply the potential application of this strategy for the fabrication of functional polymers for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

Furthermore, by modifying the propargyl&#8208;containing copolymers with quaternary ammonium groups, we have realized antibacterial functionalization of PLA. These results imply the potential application of this strategy for the fabrication of functional polymers for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized Phosphonium Cations Enable Zn Metal Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable zinc metal batteries promise attractive advantages including safety, high volumetric energy density and low cost; however, such benefits cannot be unlocked unless Zn reversibility meets stringent commercial viability. Herein, we report remarkable improvements on Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes when phosphonium&#8208;based cations are used to reshape interfacial structures and interphasial chemistries, particularly when their ligands contain ether linkage. This novel aqueous electrolyte supports unprecedented Zn reversibility by showing dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping for over 6400 h at 0.5 mA cm  &#8211;2  , or over 280 h at 2.5 mA cm  &#8211;2  , with coulombic efficiency above 99% even with 20% Zn utilization per&#8208;cycle. Excellent full cell performance is demonstrated with Na  2  V  6  O  16  &#183;1.63H  2  O cathode, which cycles for 2000 times at 300 mA g  &#8211;1  .  The microscopic characterization and modeling identify the mechanism of unique interphase chemistry from phosphonium and its functionalities as the key factors responsible for dictating reversible Zn chemistry  .</dc:description>

         <title>Rotaxanes as cages to control DNA binding, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of a small molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions in the body. To combat these deficiencies, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. Inspired by the high degree of spatiotemporal control afforded by photopharmacology, in this work we demonstrate the potential for using mechanical protection to &#8216;cage&#8217; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes which incorporate as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This compound is prevented from interacting with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper was designed to be cleaved by either light or the activity of an esterase. In the presence of such stimuli, the rotaxane breaks apart, releasing the PtII&#8208;salphen complex and activating its ability to bind to DNA. We also show the mechanically interlocked system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation, however, leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, concluded to arise from translocation to the nucleus and subsequent binding to DNA.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;bright fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) hold great promise for demanding bioimaging applications. Recently, extremely bright molecular crystals of cationic fluorophores were obtained by hierarchical co&#8208;assembly with cyanostar anion&#8208;receptor complexes of associated counterions. These small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) ensure spatial and electronic isolation to prohibit dye aggregation quenching. We report a simple, one&#8208;step supramolecular approach to formulate SMILES materials into NPs. Rhodamine&#8208;based SMILES NPs stabilized by glycol amphiphiles show high fluorescence quantum yield (30%) and brightness per volume (5000 M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  / nm  3  ) with 400 dyes packed into 16&#8208;nm particles, corresponding to a particle absorption coefficient of 4 &#215; 10  7  M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  . UV excitation of the cyanostar component leads to highest brightness (&gt;6000 M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  / nm  3  ) by energy transfer to rhodamine emitters. Coated NPs stain cells and are thus promising for bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing the Next Generation of Synthetic Mussel&#8208;Glue Polymers via Mussel&#8208;Inspired Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of mussel&#8208;glue&#8208;inspired polymers by using simple one&#8208;pot chemistry based on commodity monomers that are available in large scale offers many opportunities. A chemical oxidation route to convert commodity monomers to bisquinones is presented. These can be polymerized in Michael&#8208;type polyaddition reactions with various dithiols, which provides a modular set of glues with adhesive thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities in their backbones.







Abstract
The formation of cysteinyldopa as biogenic connectivity in proteins is used to inspire a chemical pathway toward mussel&#8208;adhesive mimics. The mussel&#8208;inspired polymerization (MIPoly) exploits the chemically diverse family of bisphenol monomers that is oxidizable with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid to give bisquinones. Those react at room temperature with dithiols in Michael&#8208;type polyadditions, which leads to polymers with thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities (TCC). A set of TCC polymers proved adhesive behavior even on challenging poly(propylene) substrates, where they compete with commercial epoxy resins in dry adhesive strength. MIPoly promises facile scale up and exhibits high modularity to tailor adhesives, as proven on a small library where one candidate showed wet adhesion on aluminum substrates in both water and sea water models.

         <title>Scan and Unlock: A Programmable DNA Molecular Automaton for Cell&#8208;Selective Activation of Ligand&#8208;Based Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent molecular&#8208;lock device of signaling ligand proteins, termed &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA), is presented. The SUDA employs DNA chemical reaction networks to autonomously scan and logically evaluate the cell&#8208;surface&#8208;protein profile of the designated cell type, selectively unlocking the signaling ligand&#8211;receptor interactions for cell&#8208;specific signaling.







Abstract
Selective modulation of ligand&#8211;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. In this study, we design an intelligent &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking the protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof of concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling.

         <title>Cooperative Stapling of Native Peptides at Lysine and Tyrosine or Arginine with Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine and nearby tyrosine or arginine residues with formaldehyde is reported.







Abstract
Stapling of peptides by intramolecular crosslinking of two neighboring amino acid side chains offers an important tool to modulate the structure and properties of peptides. In comparison to the stapling of artificially engineered peptide substrates, methods for stapling native peptides are more desirable for easier accessibility and genetic encodability. However, the existing strategy for selectivity control in the stapling of native peptides is relatively limited: the site of anchoring is often dominated by Cys, and the means for achieving the position selectivity among the same type of residues at different locations is lacking. We have developed a simple and powerful strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine residues with formaldehyde by the cooperation of nearby tyrosine or arginine residues. The stapling reactions can proceed with high efficiency and residue selectivity under mild conditions, and generate linchpins with distinct physiochemical properties. The new method for peptide stapling enables unique control of position&#8208;selectivity for substrates bearing multiple reaction sites by reactivity that can be readily built in the peptide sequence.

&lt;p&gt;Stapling of peptides by intramolecular crosslinking of two neighboring amino acid side chains offers an important tool to modulate the structure and properties of peptides. In comparison to the stapling of artificially engineered peptide substrates, methods for stapling native peptides are more desirable for easier accessibility and genetic encodability. However, the existing strategy for selectivity control in the stapling of native peptides is relatively limited: the site of anchoring is often dominated by Cys, and the means for achieving the position selectivity among the same type of residues at different locations is lacking. We have developed a simple and powerful strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine residues with formaldehyde by the cooperation of nearby tyrosine or arginine residues. The stapling reactions can proceed with high efficiency and residue selectivity under mild conditions, and generate linchpins with distinct physiochemical properties. The new method for peptide stapling enables unique control of position&#8208;selectivity for substrates bearing multiple reaction sites by reactivity that can be readily built in the peptide sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Approach in Polyoxometalate Synthesis: Formation of a New Divacant Lacunary Polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722;</title>

Pyridine&#8208;induced selective structure transformation of lacunary polyoxomolybdate [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722; led to a previously unknown divacant lacunary polyoxomolybdate bearing pyridine molecules (py) as protecting groups, [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O34(py)2]3&#8722;, in organic solvents. Lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O34(py)2]3&#8722; can act as a synthetic precursor of a POM&#8211;organic hybrid structure.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have received increasing attention over the last decades for extending their application and properties that originate from novel structures. For the synthesis of a variety of POM structures, multivacant lacunary POMs are key precursors, which are typically synthesized by empirically controlling the complex equilibrium in aqueous solvents. Unfortunately, despite the excellent catalytic and electrochemical properties of &#8220;polyoxomolybdates&#8221;, only one multivacant lacunary species, i.e., [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;, has been identified and isolated because multivacant lacunary polyoxomolybdates are typically unstable. Here we report a ligand&#8208;directed approach for the selective formation of an unprecedented lacunary polyoxomolybdate in organic solvents. By structure transformation of a pyridine&#8208;coordinated [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;, a new &#947;&#8208;Keggin&#8208;type divacant lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722; was obtained, which can be further used as a precursor for synthesizing a POM&#8211;organic hybrid.

         <title>Intramolecular Electric Field Construction in Metal Phthalocyanine as Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Material for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;21&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units with a strong intramolecular electric field is prepared and used as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The best efficiency of the PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTM realizes a record efficiency of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the excellent stability.







Abstract
Low conductivity and hole mobility in the pristine metal phthalocyanines greatly limit their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). Here, we prepare a Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units as HTMs. In NiPc, the two oxygen atoms in peripheral substituent have a modified effect on the dipole direction, while the central Ni atom contributes more electron to phthalocyanine ring, thus efficiently increasing the intramolecular dipole. Calculation analyses reveal the extracted holes within NiPc are mainly concentrated on the phthalocyanine core induced by the intramolecular electric field, and further to be transferred by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking space channel between NiPc molecules. Finally, the best efficiency of PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTMs realizes a record value of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the good moisture, heating and light stabilities. This work provides a novel way to improve the performance of PSCs with free&#8208;doped metal phthalocyanines as HTMs.

         <title>Interrupted Pyridine Hydrogenation: Asymmetric Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;catalzed hydrogenation of arenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful transformation to yield saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Yet, this transformation is limited to the sole formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we present a method to synthesize enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines. Crucial for this reaction is the interruption of the arene reduction by nucleophilic substitution.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an effective method to transform readily available arenes into saturated motifs, however, current hydrogenation strategies are limited to the formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. The stepwise addition of hydrogen yields reactive unsaturated intermediates that are rapidly reduced. In contrast, the interruption of complete hydrogenation by further functionalization of unsaturated intermediates offers great potential for increasing chemical complexity in a single reaction step. Overcoming the tenet of full reduction in arene hydrogenation has been seldom demonstrated. In this work we report the synthesis of sought&#8208;after, enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines and water by an interrupted hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electrochemical Reduction with Atomically Precise Surface Modification on Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification with Cd atom doping generates the Au19Cd2(SR)16 nanocluster, which exhibits significantly boosted CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance, doubling that of the undoped Au23. DFT calculations reveal that local surface Cd doping leads to a dynamic behavior of the sulfur active site on Au19Cd2 when interacting with CO, contributing to the energetically favorable formation of CO on the exposed sulfur active site that facilitates the overall CO2RR.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (NCs) are promising catalytic materials for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work an atomic level modification of a Au23 NC is made by substituting two surface Au atoms with two Cd atoms, and it enhances the CO2RR selectivity to 90&#8211;95&#8201;% at the applied potential between &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V, which is doubled compared to that of the undoped Au23. Additionally, the Cd&#8208;doped Au19Cd2 exhibits the highest CO2RR activity (2200&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) among the reported NCs. This synergetic effect between Au and Cd is remarkable. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that the exposure of a sulfur active site upon partial ligand removal provides an energetically feasible CO2RR pathway. The thermodynamic energy barrier for CO formation is 0.74&#8197;eV lower on Au19Cd2 than on Au23. These results reveal that Cd doping can boost the CO2RR performance of Au NCs by modifying the surface geometry and electronic structure, which further changes the intermediate binding energy. This work offers insights into the surface doping mechanism of the CO2RR and bimetallic synergism.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines with Aryl Halides via Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy for  N  &#8208;arylation of  NH&#8208;  sulfoximines has been developed by merging nickel catalysis and electrochemistry (in an undivided cell), thereby providing a practical method for the construction of sulfoximine derivatives. Paired electrolysis is employed in this protocol, so a sacrificial anode is not required. Owing to the mild reaction conditions, excellent functional group tolerance and yield are achieved. A preliminary mechanistic study indicates that the anodic oxidation of a Ni(II) species is crucial to promote the C&#8211;N bond reductive elimination from the resulting Ni(III) species at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Gold(I)&#8208;Cavitands: Total Synthesis of Mafaicheenamine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral gold(I) cavitand complexes have been developed for the enantioselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This enantioselective cyclization has been applied for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine C, and its enantiomer, stablishing its configuration as R. The cavity effect was also evaluated in the cycloisomerization of dienynes. A combination of experiments and theoretical studies demonstrates that the cavity of the gold(I) complexes forces the enynes to adopt constrained conformations, which results in the high observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.</dc:description>
