         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyanation of Propargylic Radicals Derived from Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report an efficient method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched propargyl nitriles via copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyanation of propargylic radicals, which are generated from silyl&#8208;substituted allenes or alkynes. These reactions proceeded through a highly site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) with Cu(II)&#8208;bound nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs). Notably, silyl&#8208; substituted allenes demonstrate exceptional allenic sp2 C&#8208;H bond activation selectivity, outcompeting alternative reactive sp3 C&#8208;H bonds (benzylic, allylic, and heteroatom&#8208;adjacent) in HAA processes. This chemo&#8208;selectivity profile enables precise enantiocontrol and site&#8208;specific functionalization of complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of Intermolecular Weak Binding through the Zero&#8208;Field Splitting of an Endofullerene High&#8208;Spin Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak binding between molecules is becoming a renowned aspect of molecular engineering, offering an alternative to the tuning of conventional chemical bonds. However, the subtle nature of these interactions poses challenges for characterization using standard techniques. Herein, an efficient method of weak binding characterization based on the zero&#8208;field splitting of a high&#8208;spin probe by electron paramagnetic resonance is presented. Using Endofullerene as the high spin center, we achieved direct comparison of the weak binding strengths in F&#8208;MTPP (M = H2, Zn, Ni, and Pd) and 2F&#8208;3MTPP (M = H2, Ni, Pd, and Pt) through the zero&#8208;field splitting parameters. The high&#8208;spin resonance spectrum is sensitive to the small variation in the supramolecular structure. By examining fullerene&#8208;porphyrin co&#8208;crystals with various metal centers and packing arrangements, the relation between intermolecular weak binding and microstructural strain on the fullerene cage is elucidated.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, photoinduced radical hydroarylation of unactivated N&#8208;allylamine derivatives is reported for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that ipso attack is more favourable than ortho attack when one of the ortho positions at the aromatic group attached to sulfur was blocked.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesize arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide&#8208;containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, a selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.

         <title>Unveiling an In&#8208;situ H2O2 production: Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;H2O2 battery powering 26 LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Looking towards ever&#8208;growing energy demand, the advancement in energy storage devices we have employed two bird&#8208;one stone approach viz.enabling 2e&#8208; oxygen electron reaction (ORR) to value added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) product and its utilization in the energy storage devices using MnWO4 catalyst, without any external H2O2 source. The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H2O2 production of 98% @ 0.37 V vs. RHE. The real time H2O2 production was monitored by in&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The pivotal influence of electrolyte composition viz., local pH and the formation of carbonate species on H&#8322;O&#8322; production was&#160;examined through micro&#8208;electrochemical studies using gold&#160;micro&#8208;electrode. Further, we assembled aqueous&#160;Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery &#160;which exhibited&#160;remarkable cycle life of 140 hours and energy efficiency of 43%. The&#160;Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery attained capacity of 25 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 3 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;with&#160;&#8805; 90 % of cycle efficiency and stability&#160;for more than 140 hours. and exhibited a stable OCV&#160;of 3.2 V for more than 200 hours with a promising power density of 10.5 mW cm&#8208;2. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries by powering 26 LEDs for more than 180 hours (7 days) without fading in the illumination of LEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Prebiotic Interconversion of Pyruvate and Lactate over Zeolite&#8208;Supported Ni Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni mineral can catalyze the interconversion of metabolically crucial pyruvate and lactate under hydrothermal vent conditions, which could pave the way for the modern biological process by lactate dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.








Abstract
Submarine hydrothermal vents harbor diverse microbial communities and have long intrigued researchers studying the origin of life. Transition metals in these environments can be reduced by serpentinization, potentially forming zeolite&#8208;supported transition metal nanoparticles capable of driving prebiotic chemistry. This inorganic structure could catalyze biochemical reactions, including converting metabolically crucial pyruvate before the emergence of biological processes. This study explores the catalytic interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, mediated by lactate dehydrogenase in biochemical systems, using inorganic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni nanoparticles (Ni/Y) under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Our results demonstrate that Ni/Y effectively catalyzes the hydrogenation of pyruvate in an inert environment, facilitated by the in situ generation of H&#8322; through an autocatalytic reaction between Ni/Y and H&#8322;O. Post&#8208;reaction analysis by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed structural transformations in the catalyst, including the formation of unique nickel oxide and hydroxide species, along with extra&#8208;framework aluminum from zeolite dealumination, resulting in a thin amorphous nickel oxide/hydroxide layer. Notably, Ni/Y also enables the oxidative reconversion of lactate to pyruvate under atmospheric conditions&#8212;an essential reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in biological systems. These findings underscore the potential prebiotic role of Ni/Y, suggesting they may have catalyzed the synthesis of key metabolic intermediates.

         <title>Constructing Large&#8208;Area Oriented Covalent Organic Framework Based PN Heterostructure Films to Enhance Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose for the first time the concept of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid oriented PN heterostructured films to modulate the photocatalytic performance by constructing COF&#8208;based PN heterostructured films, and our mechanistic studies confirm that oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COFs based on thin films of PN heterostructures can provide the driving force to enhance the separation efficiency and transport kinetics of photogenerated carriers, thereby greatly improving the photocatalytic activity.

Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) films exhibit enormous application potential in the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), however, they suffer from various photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we first report a new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COF&#8208;based PN heterostructure film through single&#8208;layer MoS2 induced growth, significantly enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, which promotes the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Experimental results reveal that the as&#8208;made oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF/MoS2 (TAPB: 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) benzene, DMTA: 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde) film exhibits a high photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 8154 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is &#8764;2.5 times and &#8764;4 times higher than that of non&#8208;oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF films and powder. The mechanism reveals that the oriented structure of the TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF can significantly promote the generation and the transmission of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs along the skeleton and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking direction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2O2 performance. The new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COFs&#8208;based PN heterostructure film for enhancing the photosynthesis of H2O2 will open the door to rational design of molecular films towards high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.

Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene: A novel method to facilitate rapid access to the otherwise inaccessible conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif is reported.








Abstract
Intercepting reactions have recently emerged as an innovative approach in organic synthesis, allowing chemists to harness reactive intermediates to access structures and functionalities that conventional methods cannot easily achieve. By deliberately manipulating reaction pathways, this strategy provides a unique avenue to explore unusual reactivities and complex molecular architectures. In this work, we have developed a new protocol for the nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation reaction (NuBFr). Employing tropone oxime tosylate &#8211; a simple and readily accessible precursor&#160;&#8211;&#160;and a diverse set of nucleophiles generated in situ from alcohols, phenols, thiols and alkynes with strong bases, we successfully synthesized a library of novel conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitrile derivatives. This method facilitates rapid access to the conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif, a structural feature rarely encountered in synthetic chemistry. Our computational studies indicate that the NuBFr reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bicylic azirine intermediate. The resulting Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitriles could undergo an unprecedented thermally induced 8&#960;/6&#960;/4&#960; electrocyclization cascade sequence to produce trisubstituted olefins. This sequence underscores the fundamental value of these motifs in pushing the boundaries of unusual reactivities in organic synthesis.

         <title>Immunoengineering of a Photocaged 5&#180;&#8208;triphosphate Oligoribonucleotide Ligand for Spatiotemporal Control of RIG&#8208;I Activation in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for precise control of RIG&#8208;I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), an innate immune receptor of RNA that, when activated, induces anti&#8208;tumor immune responses and cancer cell death. By incorporating photocage modifications into RNA ligands, we enable a spatially and temporally regulated immune response and offer a targeted strategy for cancer therapy while minimizing systemic effects.








Abstract
Photochemical control of oligonucleotides bears great potential for the spatio&#8208;temporal control of therapeutic targets, such as immune sensing receptors. Retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I (RIG&#8208;I) is a cytoplasmic receptor of the innate immune system that triggers antiviral responses upon detection of viral RNA. RIG&#8208;I can be specifically activated by short double&#8208;stranded (ds) RNA with a blunt 5&#8242; end bearing a triphosphate, mimicking nascent viral transcripts. Tumor cells are specifically sensitive to RIG&#8208;I&#8208;induced cell death. Here we developed a potent oligonucleotide ligand for spatiotemporally controlled activation of RIG&#8208;I by light exposure. Through structural considerations and functional studies we identified a combination of two nucleoside positions in a RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand for which the substitution of both respective 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of the ribose by photolabile protecting groups (2&#8242;&#8208;photocages) resulted in a complete loss of RIG&#8208;I ligand activity, whereas photocaging the individual positions was not sufficient to turn off RIG&#8208;I. Light exposure fully restored RIG&#8208;I activation by the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand, enabling light&#8208;controlled RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated cell death of human cancer cells which had internalized the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand prior to light exposure. This novel photoactivatable RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand may be applicable for precise light&#8208;controlled induction of tumor cell death in superficial cancer such as melanoma.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A General and Efficient Method for the Direct Synthesis of Primary Arylamines Through Electrochemical Amination of Aryl Halides With NH3 Has Been Developed. The Weak Nucleophilic Reagent NH3 Acted as an Ammonia Surrogate. This Approach Shows Good Functional Group Tolerance and a Broad Scope of Functionalized Primary Arylamines That Can be Further Late&#8208;stage Modification of Drug Molecules and Gram&#8208;scale Reaction Demonstrate Its Synthetic Utility.








Abstract
Primary arylamines are the most pivotal class of organic motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, ligands and natural products. Ammonia (NH3) is an ideal nitrogen source in terms of reactivity, atom economy, and environmental compatibility. Despite significant progress in the synthesis of primary arylamines, the development of a general method for rapid access to diversely functionalized primary arylamines is still urgent and necessary. Herein, we developed a method for the direct synthesis of primary arylamines through electrochemical amination of aryl halides with NH3. Notably, the weak nucleophilic reagent NH3 was directly used as an ammonia surrogate, allowing for efficient conversion of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds to diverse primary arylamines with good functional group tolerance. A broad scope of functionalized primary arylamines has been achieved in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Low&#8208;Redox&#8208;Barrier Two&#8208;Electron p&#8208;Type Phenoselenazine Cathode for Superior Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron organic chalcogen small molecules as cathode materials were reported, where phenoselenazine liberates high dual&#8208;electron utilization of 99.2% due to high coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow activation energy (0.23&#160;eV). The Zn&#8208;organic battery delivers the highest capacity storage and energy density among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with good cycling stability.








Abstract
Organic p&#8208;type cathode materials with high redox potentials and fast kinetics have captured widespread attention in propelling Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). However, their anion&#8208;accessible capacity is insufficient due to single electron reaction and/or high energy barrier of each redox&#8208;active unit. Here, we design two&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type organic chalcogen small molecules (phenoxazine (PO), phenothiazine (PS), and phenoselenazine (PSe)) with tuned charge distributions and electron transfer behaviors as cathode materials for ZOBs. With the decrease of chalcogenide electronegativity (O&#160;&gt;&#160;S&#160;&gt;&#160;Se), PSe liberates the strongest coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow redox activation energy (0.23&#160;vs. 0.34&#160;eV of PS and 0.41&#160;eV of PO), which contributes to high dual&#8208;electron utilization of phenazine motifs of 99.2% (vs. 68.8% of PS and 52.7% of PO). Consequently, Zn||PSe battery delivers the highest capacity storage (227&#160;mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (273&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with long life (10&#160;000 cycles). A two&#8208;electron redox mechanism is unlocked at amine/selenium sites of PSe, accompanied by reversible uptake of two CF3SO3&#8722; anions. This study highlights the considerable potential of low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier multielectron design for high&#8208;performance organic cathodes toward advanced ZOBs.

With the decrease of chalcogenide electronegativity (O&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;S&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;Se), PSe liberates the strongest coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow redox activation energy (0.23&#160;vs. 0.34&#160;eV of PS and 0.41&#160;eV of PO), which contributes to high dual-electron utilization of phenazine motifs of 99.2% (vs. 68.8% of PS and 52.7% of PO). Consequently, Zn||PSe battery delivers the highest capacity storage (227&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and energy density (273&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) among the reported p-type cells, along with long life (10&#160;000 cycles). A two-electron redox mechanism is unlocked at amine/selenium sites of PSe, accompanied by reversible uptake of two CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. This study highlights the considerable potential of low-energy-barrier multielectron design for high-performance organic cathodes toward advanced ZOBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Probes for Cellular Imaging of G&#8208;quadruplexes: Beyond Fluorescence Intensity Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA can fold into tetra&#8208;stranded helical structures known as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). There is mounting evidence suggesting that these structures have important biological roles. In this minireview we discuss advances in the design of optical probes for the detection of G4s that offer intensity&#8208;independent readouts that address limitations of conventional fluorescence intensity&#8208;based probes.








Abstract
The study of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures that form in DNA and RNA is a rapidly growing field, which has evolved from in vitro studies of isolated G4 sequences to genome&#8208;wide detection of G4s in a cellular context. This work has revealed the tangible and significant effects that G4s may have on biological regulation. This minireview describes recent progress in the design of photoluminescent intensity&#8208;independent optical probes for G4s. We discuss the design and use of probes based on fluorescence or phosphorescence lifetime, rather than intensity&#8208;based detection; spectral ratiometric probes; and fluorescent probes for single&#8208;molecule G4&#8208;detection. We argue that each of these modalities improve unbiased G4 detection in cellular experiments, overcoming problems associated with unknown cellular uptake of probes or their organelle concentration. We discuss the improvements offered by these types of probes, as well as limitations and future research directions needed to facilitate more robust research into G4 biology.

         <title>Circular RNA&#8208;Based Molecular Computation Enhances Plasma Biomarker Detection in Biliary Tract Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular diagnosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Although large panels based on multi&#8208;biomarkers have demonstrated potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, their clinical application is hindered by complexity and high costs. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system that integrates the detection of plasma circular RNAs (circRNAs) with molecular computation, enabling intelligent and rapid diagnosis of BTC. By identifying and validating a specific and small set of circRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in BTC patients, we designed a DNA computation framework that directly translates biomarker levels into diagnostic outcomes without the need of external analysis and interpretation. In a validation cohort of 70 individuals, our approach achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its potential as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient tool for rapid diagnosis of BTC. This work highlights the potential of molecular computation in enhancing integrated and rapid cancer diagnostics, paving the way for clinical implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the catalytic degradation of unsaturated polyolefin materials via Fe&#8208;based Lewis acids&#8208;initiated carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradation and recyclability of polymeric materials including extensively used polyolefins is becoming increasingly necessary. Chemically stable saturated polyolefin backbones make their degradation frustratedly challenging. The current effective strategy is to create cleavable defects e.g. C=C double bonds along the backbone, subsequently depolymerize them via cross&#8208;metathesis reaction with olefins. High&#8208;value chemicals or reusable polymeric segments are obtained. This two&#8208;step protocol provides operable means for alleviating plastics problems. There are several approaches to introduce unsaturation into polymer backbone like dehydrogenation or copolymerization of olefins and conjugated dienes. However, for the second step to conduct cross&#8208;metathesis reaction, only noble metal catalysts can be used in most time. Regardless of their limited availability, that these organometallics are unfavorably sensitive to impurities would raise barriers in industrial practices. Herein we employed earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive iron&#8208;based Lewis acids to initiate carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction between ketone/aldehyde reagents and unsaturated polyolefins. After explorations in poly(diene)s and industrial thermoplastic elastomers, we extended this protocol to degrade low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). Low&#8208;molecular weight PE wax&#8208;like products were obtained as useful chemicals. This catalytic degradation system is expected to enable the development of more efficient metathesis strategies to promote degradation of polyolefins and pave sustainable ways for reuse of polymeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed Directed C&#8211;H Arylation of Arenes: the Key Role of Bis&#8208;Cyclometalated Intermediates.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalysed N&#8208;directed C&#8208;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes has been under intense scrutiny over the last decade, with conflicting proposals concerning the relevance of various catalytic intermediates and the nature of the key steps. This work presents experimental and computational studies that address these long&#8208;standing questions. Stoichiometric, catalytic and mechanistic kinetic studies, supported by DFT calculations, reveal that bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species are key intermediates in these reactions. These studies also show that oxidative addition with bromoarenes proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition pathway, as demonstrated by DFT and experimental kinetic orders. Bromoarene activation does not proceed at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species. In the catalytic process, zero order kinetics are observed on both reaction substrates, an observation that is rationalised by DFT calculations which predict a rate&#8208;limiting step within the product&#8208;release stage. These results showcase how detailed experimental and DFT studies can combine to probe mechanistic questions, as well as resolving opposing views around the mechanism of these Ru&#8208;catalysed arylations that form the basis of promising mild C&#8208;H functionalisations.</dc:description>

         <title>Leaching&#8208;Induced Ti Trapping Stabilizes Amorphous IrOx for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal nitrides are promising conductive support materials in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas it is unclear if their electrochemical oxidation during prolonged test would affect the OER catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that the leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect from TiN supports effectively stabilizes the electrochemically oxidized amorphous IrOx catalyst. Structural characterizations reveal that the TiN support experiences severe leaching during OER test, leaving minor amounts of Ti&#8208;O species trapping on IrOx clusters, which mitigate the overoxidation of Ir(III) species and elongate the Ir&#8208;O bonds. This leads to 70% reduction of lattice oxygen oxidation and the substantially reduced Ir leaching. Additionally, self&#8208;thickening of the catalyst layers is found during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), enabling an ultralow catalyst loading of 87 &#956;gIr cm&#8208;2 to obtain a stable operation at 1.0 A cm&#8208;2 for 500 h. This work deepens the understanding of TiN supported catalysts for long&#8208;term stable OER electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Conversion of Hydrogen Peroxide and Benzaldehyde in Air by Silver Single&#8208;Atom Modified Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized g&#8208;C3N4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride (Ag@T&#9472;C3N4) photocatalyst with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. It enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2O2 production and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. Thiophene conjugation and Ag single atoms enhance light absorption and accelerate the 2e&#8722; ORR, boosting H2O2 yield, while photogenerated holes promote benzyl alcohol oxidation. The biphasic system enables spontaneous product separation. DFT calculations reveal Ag&#8208;thiophene interactions optimize the reaction pathway, strengthen catalyst&#8211;intermediate interactions, and reduce Gibbs free energy, thus enhancing efficiency.








Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride (Ag@T&#9472;C3N4), a material with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. Under visible light, Ag@T&#9472;C3N4 catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, achieving production rates of 4729.82 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 and 19.71 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for benzaldehyde. The synergy between thiophene conjugation and silver atoms extends visible light absorption and accelerates the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), enhancing H2O2 yield. Photogenerated holes oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, while the biphasic benzaldehyde&#8208;water system enables spontaneous product separation. In situ Raman spectroscopy, rotating disk electrode testing, EPR, GC&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations highlight the critical role of thiophene&#8208;silver synergy in optimizing reaction pathways, enhancing catalyst&#8208;intermediate interactions, and reducing Gibbs free energy, improving H2O2 and benzaldehyde synthesis. This study provides new insights for designing carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers a strategy for co&#8208;producing value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>An Autonomously Liquefied Hydrogel Adhesive for Programmable Bioelectronic Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel adhesives have many important applications in the fields of drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and bioelectronics. The detachment of hydrogel adhesives under the benign conditions is vital to the definitive surgical repair and implanted devices. Although stimuli&#8208;mediated detachment of hydrogel adhesives has been achieved, it is still a grand challenge to develop a transient adhesive with programmable adhesion and autonomous detachment from the substrate, especially the hairy skins. Here, we report a transient hydrogel adhesive driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface. The transient hydrogel shows tunable mechanical properties, adjustable adhesive strength, and autonomous sol&#8208;gel&#8208;sol transition with a programmable lifetime. Moreover, the transient hydrogel adhesive enables conformable and&#160;stable&#160;adhesion to various materials. In particular, the bioelectrode coated by the transient hydrogel adhesive allows to record stable and high&#8208;quality electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram signals directly on the hairy skins without hair shaving. Notably, the autonomous liquefication of the hydrogel adhesives enables the easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any noticeable damages to the hairy skins and electrode. This work paves a new avenue in the innovative development of hydrogel adhesives for the conformable and detachable bioelectronic interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Allylic C&#9472;H Amination of Olefin with Nitroarenes via Intermolecular Nitroso Ene Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a practical method for synthesizing aromatic allylamines via iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive allylic amination. This approach eliminates the need for noble metals and complements existing oxidative allylic amination by tolerating oxidizable and nucleophilic functionalities.








Abstract
Aromatic allylamines are essential in the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical building blocks. While oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination using anilines has advanced significantly, achieving intermolecular reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination of olefins with readily available nitroarenes remains a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate that replacing silanes with a combination of protons and electrons enables selective reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination, avoiding the competing hydroamination pathway. The key to this transformation is the use of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE) as the solvent. This process complements previous oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination by eliminating the need for noble metal catalysts while tolerating oxidizable or nucleophilic functional groups. Notably, this method facilitates the functionalization of bioactive compounds, underscoring its potential in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, by leveraging its reactivity with trisubstituted olefins, this approach, when combined with metal hydride atom transfer (MHAT) reactions, offers a unique strategy for regioselective and modular difunctionalization of aliphatic olefins. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies highlight the crucial roles of TFE in stabilizing the nitrosoarene intermediate and promoting the key nitroso&#8208;ene step.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Thianthrene Covalent Trimer Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials for Low&#8208;Concentration Oxygen Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emission system of fluorescence (Fluo.) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling was constructed via thianthrene covalent trimerization, enabling high oxygen sensitivity and ratiometric optical oxygen sensing. The significant emission color and intensity change under varying oxygen concentrations allows for real&#8208;time video&#8208;based monitoring of low&#8208;concentration oxygen.








Abstract
Oxygen is ubiquitous and vital to life, industry, and environmental safety, so accurate and reliable oxygen sensing and detection are of great significance, especially for oxygen in the low concentration range. Herein, two pure organic metal&#8208;free room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials were developed using a covalent trimerization strategy of thianthrene (TA), which exhibit high oxygen sensitivity and fluorescence&#8208;RTP separated dual emission due to the moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Compared with traditional metal&#8208;organic complexes, the oxygen sensitivity of RTP is improved by about two orders of magnitude, especially facilitating accurate quantitative detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen. Leveraging oxygen quenching&#8208;induced changes in emission color and intensity, coupled with computer&#8208;assisted image processing, a simple oxygen monitoring device was established to realize real&#8208;time and accurate detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen, promoting the industrial practical application in many related fields.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing and Interfacial Contact via Halogenated N&#8208;Glycidyl Carbazole Small Molecules for Low Energy Loss and Highly Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ideal interfacial contact and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) limit their further development. Herein, two carbazole&#8208;based molecules with different halogen atoms (X&#8208;OCZ, X = Cl or Br) are developed as efficient interfacial regulators. The halogen effect not only finely modulates the molecular packing, crystallinity, and surface contact potential of MeO&#8208;2PACz analogue via self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions, but also significantly influences the subsequent crystal growth of perovskite, thus resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity, improved energy level alignment, and depressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Importantly, Cl&#8208;OCZ mediated device exhibits a minimal interfacial carrier transport energy barrier of 0.10 eV and an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%. Moreover, the target device (aperture area: 0.09 cm2) shows the highest efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%) along with enhanced thermal and operational stability. The strategy is also extended to large area devices, delivering efficiencies of 25.0% for a 1 cm2 device and 22.9% for a 12.96 cm2 minimodule. This study highlights the halogen role of interfacial small molecules on optimizing molecular packing and interfacial contact toward highly efficient PSCs with minimized energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose Toward Propyl&#8208; or Propenyl&#8208;Substituted Monomers and Mechanistic Understanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol solvolyzed lignin followed by simultaneous cleavage of C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bond enables valorization of native lignin in biomass toward prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (79.6% selectivity) and propyl (81.7% selectivity) substituted monomers under N2 and H2 atmosphere, respectively.








Abstract
Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru0.8/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oils (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4&#8208;propylguaiacol and 4&#8208;propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H2 pressure and using methanol as the solvent. But, under N2 atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)guaiacol and 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol&#8208;extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH at the monomeric level. Thus, this work provided novel insights into the reaction pathway of (native) lignin depolymerization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oils (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4-propylguaiacol and 4-propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure and using methanol as the solvent. But, under N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4-(prop-1-enyl)guaiacol and 4-(prop-1-enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;OH in methanol-extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4-(prop-1-enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop-1-enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with removal of the C&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;OH at the monomeric level.

         <title>Extending Frontier Molecular Orbitals Delocalization via Donor Fusion: Construct Long&#8208;Wavelength Twisted Multiple Resonance Emitters with Efficient Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general donor fusion strategy is proposed to extend frontier molecular orbital delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed. BN&#8208;PhAzCz achieves the best device performances, exhibiting green emission at 528&#160;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69), maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2%, and efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising candidates for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) displays. Here, we propose a general strategy for post&#8208;functionalizing MR core, introducing donors on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) position via Suzuki coupling and then fusing the donors to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position via Scholl cyclization, which can extend frontier molecular orbitals delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed, achieving large spectral red&#8208;shifts while maintaining narrowband emission. The distorted configuration resulting from the hetero[6]helicene structure introduces twisted &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, which effectively enhances spinorbit coupling, ultimately enabling molecule BN&#8208;PhAzCz to achieve a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC = 6.4 &#215; 104 s&#8722;1). BN&#8208;PhAzCz&#8208;based single&#8208;host OLED exhibits green emission at 528 nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2% with efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 under 5 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 29.6% with little change in the spectral profile.

         <title>Reverse Regioselective Dicarbofunctionalization via Anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;Type Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reverse regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition is reported. Various (hetero)arene nucleophiles and carbon electrophiles were incorporated in a manner opposite to conventional regioselectivity. A key feature of this reaction is the formation of an alkylpalladium intermediate, which enables the achievement of the uncommon regioselectivity.








Abstract
Vicinal dicarbofunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a classical yet versatile method for constructing complex molecular architectures in a single step. However, the regioselectivity is typically governed by the electronic properties of the alkene moiety, leading to the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#946;&#8208;position and an electrophile at the &#945;&#8208;position. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition, achieving reverse regioselectivity relative to traditional approaches. This strategy enables the efficient incorporation of various (hetero)arene nucleophiles at the &#945;&#8208;position and carbon electrophiles, including iodoarenes, vinyl iodides, and iodomethane, at the &#946;&#8208;position to furnish dicarbofunctionalized amides in good yields. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds through an alkylpalladium intermediate formed via the &#945;&#8208;addition of a nucleophile.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Sourced 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dithiolanes for Recyclable Poly(disulfide)s with High Performance</title>

         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis was developed to access aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers. The resulting aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability and stability, as well as a range of desirable thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, showing potential toward sustainable materials.








Abstract
The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#9472;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.

         <title>Design and Construction of D&#8208;A&#8208;Extended 3D Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study successfully developed three distinct 3D extended D&#8208;A COFs with a pyr topology by employing a newly designed intrinsic D&#8208;A type building block. Among these, the A&#8208;D&#8208;A structured COF stands out due to its multiple charge transfer channels in 3D space, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. This finding provides valuable insights into designing extended D&#8208;A constructs within 3D frameworks to optimize photocatalytic performance. 








Abstract
The development of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Although most studies have concentrated on 2D COFs, research into their 3D counterparts remains limited. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized a carbazoyl dicyanobenzene derivative (TBFCC) as an intrinsic D&#8208;A building block. By selecting TAPA, TAPB, and TAPT as the donor, acceptor&#8208;&#960;, and acceptor donors, respectively, we synthesized three distinct D&#8208;A&#8208;extended COF materials: D&#8208;D&#8208;A, A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;A, and A&#8208;D&#8208;A. Among these, 3D&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF, featuring an A&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 31.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported 3D COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This superior performance is attributed to its A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration, which provides multiple charge transfer pathways in 3D space, overcoming the electron transport limitations inherent in 2D COFs. Consequently, this feature facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charges within the framework and reduces carrier recombination, thereby optimizing photocatalytic efficiency.

Among these, 3D-TAPT-COF, featuring an A-D-A structure, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 31.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing most previously reported 3D COF-based photocatalysts. This superior performance is attributed to its A-D-A configuration, which provides multiple charge transfer pathways in 3D space, overcoming the electron transport limitations inherent in 2D COFs. Consequently, this feature facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charges within the framework and reduces carrier recombination, thereby optimizing photocatalytic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Photochemical Generation of a Short&#8208;Lived, Twisted Cycloheptenone Isomer: Catalytic Formation, Detection, and Consecutive Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, it was for the first time shown that planar chiral trans&#8208;cycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;enones, such as 2, can be formed enantioselectively from their cis&#8208;isomers by triplet energy transfer from a chiral catalyst. Computational studies performed with cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone and enone 1 provided invaluable insights into the mode of action of the sensitizing thioxanthone catalyst.








Abstract
Cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid undergoes a photochemical isomerization from its cis&#8208; to its trans&#8208;form either upon direct irradiation (&#955;&#160;=&#160;366&#160;nm) or in the presence of a triplet sensitizer (&#955;&#160;=&#160;459&#160;nm). The intermediate chiral trans&#8208;isomer was detected by step&#8208;scan FTIR, displaying a lifetime of 130&#160;&#181;s (r.t., CH2Cl2). Ensuing Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of the trans&#8208;isomer occurred smoothly and produced chiral trans&#8208;fused cycloaddition products (14 examples, 24%&#8211;98% yield). Benzylation led to esters, which were separated by chiral HPLC and which were employed to evaluate a possible enantioselective reaction course. It was discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid with a pendant sensitizing group induces a notable enantioselectivity in the photoisomerization step. The planar chirality of the trans&#8208;cycloheptene translates into point chirality in the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (seven examples, up to 38% ee). Computational studies suggest that the chiral conformation of the cis&#8208;isomer adopted within the assembly to the chiral phosphoric acid induces the enantioselectivity in a one&#8208;bond flip (OBF) toward the trans&#8208;isomer. Trajectory surface hopping (TSH) simulations showed exemplarily how a chiral trans&#8208;cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone is formed from a chiral cis&#8208;conformer. For the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a weak ground state selectivity was found to attenuate the enantioselectivity achieved in the photochemical step.

         <title>Ternary Metalation in a Copper&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Tandem Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem photocatalytic heterometallic COF system combining photosensitive Ru sites, CO&#8208;producing Co sites, and multi&#8208;electron&#8208;reducing trinuclear Cu sites has been constructed by a sequential post&#8208;synthetic metallization strategy. The synergistic effect of the multiple Ru, Co, and Cu sites leads to a highly efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with efficient synergistic effects for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction is sought&#8208;after yet challenging. Herein, a tandem photocatalytic strategy has been developed through sequential post&#8208;synthetic metalation (SPSM) of variable Ru/Co&#8208;sites into a trinuclear Cu&#8208;based COF, Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, to construct a series of tri&#8208;metallized covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the Ru:Co molar ratios of 1/39.6, 1/19.6, or 1/12.7, respectively), for photocatalytic CO2 methanation in high selectivity. The introduction of a small fraction of Ru&#8208;sites confers the framework with enhanced visible&#8208;light response, while the Co&#8208;sites immobilized in the bipyridine units significantly boost the generation of CO to enrich its concentration around the active trinuclear Cu&#8208;sites, which enables dramatically improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity toward CH4. Significantly, the optimized Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;2 showcases exceptional photocatalytic activity with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%, 15.0 times higher than that of Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru) merely introducing Ru&#8208;photosensitizer. The underlying photocatalytic mechanism has been studied to unveil how the ternary Ru/Co/Cu&#8208;sites collaborate to result in highly efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, shedding light on the design of highly selective CO2 methanation photocatalysts by leveraging the synergistic effect of multiple active centers within heterometallic covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (HM&#8208;COFs).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Methanol Activation on Hexagonal CdS for Triggering C&#9472;H Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal&#8208;CdS&#8208;based photocatalytic methanol activation was employed for triggering C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The hole&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated cleavage of methanol C&#9472;H bond and electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated reduction of hydroxymethylated intermediate were identified. Such transformations not only facilitate the cascade utilization of photogenerated holes and electrons, but also enable selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated products.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven methanol activation paves the way for pursuing C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, where selectively converting methanol into the corresponding hydroxymethyl radical (&#8226;CH2OH) is an essential prerequisite. Inspired by the versatile methanol activation on photoexcited solids, we here report a practicable semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic system for C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. To be specific, hexagonal cadmium sulfide (h&#8208;CdS) was identified to be an ideal platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic methanol activation, where selective &#8226;CH2OH generation undergoing a hole&#8208;transfer process without any additional co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvent could trigger C&#9472;H hydroxymethylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The following electron transfer between photoexcited h&#8208;CdS and hydroxymethylated intermediates could finally lead to the formation of methylated N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformations facilitate the cascade utilization of photoinduced hole and electron, thereby endowing h&#8208;CdS with extraordinary photocatalytic performance. Besides, selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated product could be facilely implemented in the presence/absence of electron scavengers.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Enables Access to High&#8208;Performance Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Polyamides with Chemical Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address these key challenges faced in PA6 chemistry, we aimed to prepare a new class of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams bearing various substituents (BLMR) as monomers. The robust polymerization of these monomers furnished a series of semiaromatic polyamides P(BLMR) with improved water resistance, transparency, and chemical recyclability.








Abstract
Although polyamides (PAs) have served as one of the most important engineering thermoplastics, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for chemical recycling of PAs to monomers. Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a series of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams with various functionalities (BLMR). These BLMR monomers underwent robust and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization to afford P(BLMR) products with high thermal stability, enhanced water resistance, and tunable mechanical properties. Impressively, chemical recycling of P(BLMR) to monomer could be accomplished with excellent efficiency in dilute solution at 100&#8722;150 &#176;C with a mixed catalyst of t&#8208;BuOK and La[N(SiMe3)2]3, thus establishing a closed&#8208;loop circularity. The precise control of the polymerization and the recyclability of these semiaromatic polyamides promote a sustainable circular economy while offering the potential to access high&#8208;performance materials with tunable thermal and mechanical properties and enhanced water resistance.

The robust polymerization of these monomers furnished a series of semiaromatic polyamides P(BLM&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;) with improved water resistance, transparency, and chemical recyclability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although polyamides (PAs) have served as one of the most important engineering thermoplastics, it remains a long-standing challenge for chemical recycling of PAs to monomers. Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a series of benzo-fused caprolactams with various functionalities (BLM&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;). These BLM&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; monomers underwent robust and well-controlled ring-opening polymerization to afford P(BLM&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;) products with high thermal stability, enhanced water resistance, and tunable mechanical properties. Impressively, chemical recycling of P(BLM&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;) to monomer could be accomplished with excellent efficiency in dilute solution at 100&#8722;150 &#176;C with a mixed catalyst of &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BuOK and La[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, thus establishing a closed-loop circularity. The precise control of the polymerization and the recyclability of these semiaromatic polyamides promote a sustainable circular economy while offering the potential to access high-performance materials with tunable thermal and mechanical properties and enhanced water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Quinoid Building Block for Polymer Semiconductors with Tunable Polarity and High n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple quinoid building block TTD, featuring small steric hindrance and high electron deficiency, was obtained via a one&#8208;step synthesis. Unexpectedly, the TTD&#8208;based polymers showed tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, and the n&#8208;doped polymers attained remarkable thermoelectric performance with a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. 








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers with deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron&#8208;deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), via one step from a low&#8208;cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.91&#160;eV for PQD and &#8722;3.73&#160;eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n&#8208;doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and finally to n&#8208;type in organic field&#8208;effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n&#8208;doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n&#8208;doped quinoid&#8208;based polymers. This work underscores the great potential of structurally simple and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Retained Oxygen Regulation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper for Promoted CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thickness determined strategy has been demonstrated to regulate oxygen retention in oxide&#8208;derived Cu for CO2 electroreduction. With the thickness decreasing to 1.6&#160;nm, the CuO nanosheets exhibit enhanced oxygen retention and reoxidation ability, achieving up to 84.6% C2+ faradaic efficiency at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the retained oxygen facilitates *CHO intermediate formation and promotes *OC&#9472;CHO coupling, thereby enhancing C2+ selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products provides an attractive route to store intermittent renewable electricity as high value&#8208;added chemicals. Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) has been widely investigated for its tunable selectivity toward multicarbon (C2+) products; however, it still remains a challenge to understand and regulate the retained oxygen of OD&#8208;Cu in the complex reconstruction process. In this work, we investigate thickness determined residual oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, using CuO nanosheets as prototype precatalysts. When the thickness of CuO precatalyst decreased to 1.6&#160;nm, the enhancement of the ability to retain oxygen are achieved, leading to selective C2+ production with Faradaic efficiency of around 80% over a wide current density range of 300&#8211;700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a peak value of 84.6% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Long&#8208;time molecular dynamics simulations reveal the enhanced stability of Cu&#8211;CuO structure with the layers of removed oxygen increased, favoring *CHO formation and *OC&#8208;CHO coupling toward C2+ products; structural characterizations and electrochemical results further demonstrate the reconstructed stacked nanosheets with high oxygen retention capacity and easily reoxidized metallic Cu sites. This work underscores the crucial role of the retained oxygen for the OD&#8208;Cu performance and provides insights into designing OD&#8208;Cu with oxygen retention to enhance C2+ products formation.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Molecular Configuration to Drive Facet&#8208;Selective Zn Metal Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a fundamental study elucidating the influence of dicarboxylic acids with varying alkyl chain lengths on their adsorption configuration, strength, and deposition rate on Zn surfaces, which ultimately enables control over highly facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition at metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface.








Abstract
The direct use of metal anode emerges as a key strategy in advancing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, applicable across non&#8208;protonic, aqueous, and solid&#8208;state battery systems. To enhance battery durability, one effective approach involves employing interfacial molecular modification to modulate metal's facet orientation, reducing the tendency of metals to form random and loose morphologies during deposition. Herein, we propose a model to elucidate how dicarboxylic acid molecules with varying alkyl chain lengths modulate their adsorption behavior and deposition rate on zinc (Zn) surfaces, achieving facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition. Taking glutaric acid (GA) as an example, its medium alkyl chain length allows for a &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption configuration on Zn(002) surface, resulting in strong adsorption and Zn&#8208;GA metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface. This regulates Zn2+ diffusion process and restricts its accessibility to Zn(002) facet, facilitating the selective exposure of Zn(002) facet. Due to this design, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell stably operates at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high depth of discharge of 85%. The Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves a high capacity of 1.1&#160;Ah with 90% capacity retention. This metal&#8208;molecule interface design can be extended to other metal anodes, with the potential for tailored molecular selections to regulate the selective growth of crystal facets.

         <title>The Role of Convex Edge Site in Fully&#8208;Exposed Pt Cluster Catalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters on CeO2 outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites and hollow sites) in cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction due to their excellent C&#9472;H bond activation capability and prohibition of undesired C&#9472;C bond cleavage&#8208;induced site reactions or benzene poisoning. 








Abstract
Achieving a precise understanding of the active site structure has long been an ultimate goal in fundamental heterogeneous catalysis research, yet it remains exceptionally challenging in nanocluster catalysis. In Pt&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexane dehydrogenation for liquid organic carriers (LOHC), previous efforts have provided valuable insights into the size effects of nanoclusters. However, the optimal geometry of the active sites has remained elusive and, at times, contradictory. In this study, we investigate the geometric effect and the active site structure in fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters supported on ceria that exhibit superior activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation (11.4&#160;mol molPt&#8722;&#185; s&#8722;&#185;), characterized by small coordination numbers, high metal utilization efficiency, and abundant convex edge sites. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites, hollow sites, etc.) in dehydrogenation reactions. These convex edge sites are not only efficient in C&#9472;H activation but, more notably, are also resistant to detrimental carbonaceous intermediates, hence enabling high and long&#8208;lived H2 production activity.

         <title>Application of Molecular Ferroelectric in Photocatalytic Selective Oxidization of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) achieves a remarkable 104&#8208;fold enhancement in alkane oxidation activity compared to BaTiO3, with a turnover number (TON) of 6286 under light and ultrasound. Its built&#8208;in electric field enables efficient charge separation, while synergistic effects drive reactive oxygen species generation, highlighting its promising application in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics utilize metal nodes and organic groups as catalytic active sites, with the surrounding ferroelectric polarization significantly enhancing catalytic activity and showcasing tremendous application potential. However, their application in photocatalysis remains underexplored. This study presents the first investigation of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) as a photocatalyst for alkane oxidation. Under the combined effects of light and ultrasound, this catalyst exhibited a notable turnover number (TON) of 6286&#160;&#177;&#160;491, which is 104 times higher than that of inorganic ferroelectrics like barium titanate (BaTiO3). The molecular ferroelectric exhibits excellent recyclability, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies indicate that the built&#8208;in electric field within the molecular ferroelectric facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers, thereby enhancing its ferroelectric photocatalytic activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results further reveal that the synergistic effects of light and ultrasound effectively generate reactive oxygen species. These findings underscore the unique advantages of molecular ferroelectrics compared to rigid inorganic counterparts, including their distinctive structural features and finely tunable catalytic performance, highlighting their potential for developing homogeneous, precisely active sites and efficient photocatalysts. This research lays the foundation for the broader application of molecular ferroelectrics in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>A Photoactivatable Plasma Membrane Probe Based on a Self&#8208;Triggered Photooxidation Cascade for Live Cell Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we establish a new photoswitching concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC). Rhodamine dyes have mild photosensitizing properties that enable subsequent photoactivation and photobleaching of a leuco&#8208;rhodamine plasma membrane probe. Upon laser irradiation in the visible range, we successfully performed live SMLM (Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy), allowing to image the plasma membrane at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging based on the localization of single emitters requires a spatio&#8208;temporal control of the ON and OFF states. To this end, photoactivatable fluorophores are adapted as they can be turned on upon light irradiation. Here, we present a concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC) based on the photooxidation of a plasma membrane&#8208;targeted leuco&#8208;rhodamine (LRhod&#8208;PM), a non&#8208;fluorescent reduced form of a rhodamine probe. Upon visible light irradiation the small number of oxidized rhodamines, Rhod&#8208;PM, acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen capable of oxidizing the OFF state LRhod&#8208;PM thereby switching it to its ON state. We showed that this phenomenon is kinetically favored by a high local concentration and propagates quickly when the probe is embedded in membrane bilayers. In addition, we showed that the close proximity of the dyes favors the photobleaching. At the single&#8208;molecule level, the concomitant activation/bleaching phenomena allow reaching a single&#8208;molecule blinking regime enabling single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy for super&#8208;resolution of live cellular membranes and their thin processes including filopodia and tuneling nanotubes.

         <title>Origin of Lithium Dendrite Formation in Sulfide&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionization levels (ILs) of typical Li3PS4 (LPS) configurations served as effective descriptors to evaluate the preference of Li0 deposition within LPS&#8208;based electrolytes. Both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, comprising crystalline LPS (c&#8208;LPS), amorphous LPS (a&#8208;LPS), and fully lithiated LPS (LixLPS), were predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including crack surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs), were identified as critical contributors to the Li dendrite initiation and propagation over the course of battery cycling, ultimately driving dendrite growth.








Abstract
The Li dendrite growth during battery cycles is a well&#8208;known obstacle to the practical application of sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes (SEs), notably Li3PS4 (LPS), in lithium metal batteries. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding the mechanism for Li dendrite penetration through SEs exhibiting high shear modulus. Herein, we investigate the optimum deposition sites for Li0 atoms within typical LPS configurations, encompassing crystalline, lithiated, and degraded structures, with their ionization levels employed as descriptors to determine the preferential state (Li0/Li+) of the interstitial Li. Our results suggest that both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including cracks&#160;and grain boundaries (GBs), exhibit a marked propensity to promote the electrochemical deposition of Li0 atoms. Once Li dendrites initiate, the electronic conductivities of those defects undergo a significant surge, catalyzing electron transport and facilitating Li dendrite penetration through the SEs, ultimately driving dendrite growth. Furthermore, we underscore the synergistic interaction between Li dendrite propagation and crack formation within SEs, offering deeper insights into the electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation mechanism in SEs. These findings present novel methodologies for predicting Li dendrite growth and open up alternative perspectives in SE engineering.

         <title>Near&#8208;Zero Thermal Expansion in Coordination Polymer Cd(1,2,4&#8208;Triazole)2(H2PO4)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural dynamics and the chemical bonding origin of a volumetric near&#8208;zero thermal expansion in a coordination polymer across 25&#160;K to 400&#160;K is studied using multi&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography and X&#8208;ray electron density analysis. The lattice expansion in the a and c directions is counteracted by contraction along b axis, caused by concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom librations of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs.








Abstract
Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near&#8208;zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4&#8208;triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd&#8208;Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25&#160;K&#8211;400&#160;K. Using multi&#8208;temperature high&#8208;resolution single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine&#8208;rack&#8208;like framework of Cd&#8208;Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn&#8208;Tz and Mn&#8208;Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd&#8208;Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c&#8764;22&#160;MK&#8722;1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b&#8764;&#8722;47&#160;MK&#8722;1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs. X&#8208;ray electron density analysis and modeling of low&#8208;temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd&#8208;triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal&#8722;ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (&#8764;8/12%) in the Cd&#8208;Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by Tri&#8208;Coordinated Cobalt Sites in Silicate&#8208;1 Zeolite</title>

A carbon&#8208;free electrocatalyst based on embedding Co sites into silicate&#8208;1 zeolite exhibits exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of silicate&#8208;1 zeolite isolates Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. Such a moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption while it holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the whole barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieves a high yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) emerges as a sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. However, metal catalysts are commonly supported by graphitic carbon that is susceptible to being oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated in ORR and have limited oxygen capacities. Here, we report a silica&#8208;based electrocatalyst embedding cobalt (Co) sites into silicate&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolite, which exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of S&#8208;1 zeolite highly isolated Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. The nanochannels of S&#8208;1 zeolite further provide robust and substantial reaction spaces, where the Co(OSi)3 moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption and holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieved high Faradaic efficiency over 96% and a steady yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a gas diffusion electrode setup. This work provides a novel insight into 2e&#8722; ORR on Co sites and highlights the potential of zeolite&#8208;based materials for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Modulating Active Hydrogen Supply and O2 Adsorption: Sulfur Vacancy Matters for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photocatalyst of Ni doped ZnS with sulfur vacancy is designed for photocatalytic H2O2 production via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The Ni and S dual sites with optimized O2 adsorption and efficient *Hads supply contributes to a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water.








Abstract
Photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) represents a promising approach for H2O2 production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O2 adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni&#8208;doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv) as a dual&#8208;site 2e&#8722; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H2O2 production. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal the vital roles of Sv in modulating the electronic structures of Ni and S dual sites toward enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity. The atomically dispersed Ni sites with electron&#8208;rich state enable a Pauling&#8208;type (end&#8208;on) O2 adsorption configuration and a modest binding strength of O2 and OOH*, largely avoiding the O&#9472;O bond cleavage. Besides, the formation of electron&#8208;deficient S sites weakens the S&#9472;Hads bond, facilitating *Hads migration to adjacent Ni sites and accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of O2 to OOH* intermediate. As a result, the elaborately designed Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv photocatalyst exhibits a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water. Our work offers new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis systems.

         <title>Chiral Luminescent Ion Pair (CLIP) Strategy Enables Amorphous Platinum Complexes Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) materials based on chiral anion strategy were synthesized with high&#8208;performance circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) in amorphous states. The trade&#8208;off problem between good processability and high asymmetry factor was solved by constructing CLIP molecules and utilizing polymer entanglement or rapid solvent evaporation to form amorphous structures.








Abstract
Chiral ion&#8208;pairing (CIP) has been developed as an effective chirality transfer strategy from chiral ionic species to its achiral counter&#8208;ionic substrate. When the achiral counter&#8208;ions were endowed with luminescent properties, the resultant chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) will open a new window for high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence. In this research, three pairs of CLIP molecules featuring the platinum complexes as achiral cationic luminophores and the chiral anion (CA) as chiral source were constructed. The CLIP molecules demonstrate circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with quantum yields (&#934;PL) up to 71.5%, dissymmetry factor (gcpp) values of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 in amorphous state and gcpp up to &#8722;0.99 in cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC). Results show that the chiroptical properties can be assigned to the chirality transfer from the CAs to the formed twisted dimeric or oligomeric self&#8208;assemblies of platinum complex cations. This research presents a new approach for achieving high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence of amorphous chiral metal complexes, providing a concise model for revealing the chirality transfer in CLIP materials.

This study introduces the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial AI&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.








Abstract
Inflammation plays a crucial role in progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); thus, the discovery of rapid and precise analytical tools to assess inflammation related to CVDs is highly desirable for their diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. However, a straightforward and systematic method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in heart organoids has yet to be developed. Herein, we describe the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.

         <title>Wearing Gigantic Silver Armor on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalates: Formation of Supertetrahedral Intercluster Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach has been developed to construct three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, which can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures and exhibit photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. 








Abstract
Compared to versatile polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;templated Ag clusters, the construction of closed Ag clusters using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing polyoxometalates (TMCPOMs) as anionic templates has, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this work, we have synthesized three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2&#183;10CH3CN (1), [{(Cu0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2 (2), and [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(GeW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[GeW12O40]2 (3), using a universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that the high&#8208;nuclearity transition metal&#8208;containing (M&#160;=&#160;Co/Cu) POMs with idealized Td symmetry are closely covered by gigantic Ag armors, representing the largest TMCPOM&#8208;templated closed Ag clusters to date. Moreover, compounds 1&#8722;3 can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures through Columbic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic {Ag114} clusters and the counter [XW12O40]4&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Si/Ge) anions. Upon light irradiation, all three compounds exhibited decent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, which is dependent on their different electronic structures.

         <title>Catch, Cut, or Block? Versatile 4&#8208;N&#8208;Derivatized Sialyl Glycosides for Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Detection and Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids synthesized by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme (OP2E) chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy have been shown to be versatile probes. They can resist sialidase cleavage, be selective substrates by influenza sialidases, or be nanomolar substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors and affinity ligands selectively for influenza sialidases. Beads immobilized with 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;sialosides have been demonstrated for purifying influenza virions.








Abstract
Seasonal influenza continues to threaten human lives and pose a significant burden to healthcare systems and the economy, emphasizing the need for developing better influenza vaccines, diagnostics, and antiviral therapeutics. To address these challenges, we generated a library of structurally diverse sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy. Sialosides containing 4&#8208;azido&#8208;substituted sialic acid were selectively cleaved by sialidases from influenza viruses, whereas sialosides containing 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid were resistant to sialidase cleavage. Interestingly, sialosides containing 4&#8208;amino&#8208; or 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid were effective inhibitors moderately or highly resistant to cleavage by influenza sialidases (also called neuraminidases). The sialosides containing the 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid represent a new class of sialidase substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors. We took advantage of this unique property to create a ligand&#8208;based approach for efficiently isolating influenza virions from egg allantoic fluid with high purity. Together, these compounds are versatile probes and ligands for developing new approaches to detect, profile, isolate, and characterize influenza viruses via neuraminidases on their surface.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Regulation of Catalytic DNA Circuits Using Phosphorylated Charge Reversal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) was developed for efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery or release of catalytic DNA circuitry probes via phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure, thus enabling the precisely space&#8208;controllable in vivo microRNA (miRNA) imaging.








Abstract
Catalytic DNA circuits have emerged as a powerful tool for high&#8208;performance biosensing application; however, the establishment of a safe and efficient in vivo delivery system remains a critical bottleneck. Peptides serve as attractive carriers due to their rich chemical diversity, excellent biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and specific binding ability, making them ideal candidates for the on&#8208;demand regulation of DNA circuits&#8212;yet remains largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) for the efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery and release of catalytic circuitry probes through a phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure. This ERP&#8208;programmed catalytic DNA circuit enables the precise, spatially controllable in vivo imaging of microRNA (miRNA). The multifunctional cationic peptide formed a stable nanocomplex with anionic DNA cargo via strong electrostatic interactions, thus protecting the DNA probes from degradation in biological environments. Moreover, with the ability to actively targeting tumor cells and facilitate endogenous phosphorylation&#8208;guided release of DNA probes, this multifunctional peptide could significantly reduce the nonspecific delivery of probes to healthy tissues, thereby minimizing unwanted off&#8208;site signal leakage. By the integration of cell&#8208;selective delivery and site&#8208;specific stimulation, this endogenously regulated and multiply guaranteed DNA circuit system paves a simple yet effective way for disease diagnosis.

         <title>Balancing CO2 Adsorption and H2 Activation on Confined ZnOx Species for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 activation on ZnO suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption, which impedes CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast, monodispersed ZnOx confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism, enabling H2 homolytic activation and CO2 hydrogenation at 303&#160;K.








Abstract
Many oxide catalysts exhibit high selectivity but low conversion in CO2 hydrogenation due to strong CO2 adsorption, which often impedes H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Herein, we report that a ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst featuring monodispersed ZnOx overlayer confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism in which ZnCr2O4 surface and/or ZnOx/ZnCr2O4 interface provide sites for CO2 activation and monodispersed ZnOx promote homolytic H2 dissociation and formation of stable metal&#9472;H species, enabling formate formation through hydrogen spillover to CO2 adsorption sites for hydrogenation at 303&#160;K. In contrast, H2 activation on ZnO or ZnCr2O4 suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption. Consequently, the ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst shows 2&#8722;8 folds enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation between 623&#8722;773&#160;K than ZnO and maintains 33% conversion and 100% CO selectivity at 723&#160;K over 150&#160;h. The established structure&#8208;performance relationship illustrates the critical role of dual&#8208;site catalysis and hydrogen spillover in hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Neighboring Carbon Defects Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation of Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts Toward Efficient Aerobic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular oxygen (O2) activation is crucial but challenging for aerobic reactions. By introducing neighboring carbon defects, the d&#8208;electron arrangement of cobalt single atom is regulated from low spin to high spin, enhancing O2 adsorption at cobalt site, resulting in the formation of more radicals &#183;O2&#8722; to achieve alcohol oxidation to acids and esters.








Abstract
The effective adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen (O2) is crucial for aerobic alcohol oxidation; however, flexibly modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to improve the capability remains challenging. Herein, the concentration of carbon defects surrounding the nitrogen&#8208;coordinated cobalt (Co) single atoms on candle soot is controlled just through adjusting the amount of polyethyleneimine which chemically decorates the surface of candle soot to anchor Co ions. The concentration increase of carbon defects boosts the aerobic alcohol oxidation over the Co single&#8208;atom catalyst as well as ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalyst. Moreover, a series of alcohols, including those with sensitive groups, reach an outstanding yield. Significantly, the calculations and experiments verify that the carbon defects lead to the rearrangement of d&#8208;orbitals of Co atom and an elevation in the spin states of dyz and dz2${{\mathrm{d}}}_{{{\mathrm{z}}}^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, compared with low&#8208;spin Co atom, the stronger electron&#8208;transfer interaction between high&#8208;spin Co atom and O2 enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and the generation of more superoxide radicals to promote alcohol oxidation. Our findings provide a new way for developing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for sustainable aerobic alcohol oxidation via manipulating the spin configurations of single atoms.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor via Increasing Interfacial Disorder to Inhibit Bimolecular Recombination for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule, CNDT, is introduced into the active layer and increases the disorder of electron donor/acceptor interfaces. It enhances the energy of the charge transfer state and leads to an uphill energy barrier for bimolecular recombination, reduces charge recombination rate/ratio and inhibits bimolecular recombination in OSCs. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO based OSCs featuring CNDT achieve arecord fill factor of 83.17% and an impressive PCE of 19.80%.








Abstract
The inferior fill factor (FF) is one of main reasons impeding further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). But no theoretical framework for high FFs has been established yet. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to enhance FFs via introducing a small molecule, CNDT, into active layer to increase electron donor/acceptor interface disorder, raise energy barrier for charge back transfer, and thus reduce bimolecular recombination rate constant (krec). CNDTs tend to distribute over donor/acceptor interfaces and disturb molecular stacking of Y6 to deliver more disordered donor/acceptor interfaces but higher crystal quality in the D18:Y6+ blend film, compared to D18:Y6. Altogether, in the D18:Y6+ blend film, a higher energy of charge transfer state magnifies energy barrier for charge recombination to decrease charge recombination rate/ratio and reduce krec, inhibiting bimolecular recombination in devices. Therefore, FFs of OSCs are improved from 75.78% (D18:Y6) to 81.13% (D18:Y6+), yielding a higher PCE of 19.45%. Moreover, D18:L8&#8208;BO+ based OSCs feature FFs over 83%, a record for OSCs so far. PCE increases subsequently to 19.80%. It demonstrates that increasing interface disorder without sacrificing crystal quality enhances energy barrier of charge recombination and inhibits bimolecular recombination to efficiently improve FFs for higher PCEs.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H Shift: Unlocking Migration along Coupling Partners in Olefin Borylcarbofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented migratory functionalization of olefins is reported, where migration occurs selectively along the coupling partner via a 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. Additionally, the integration of 1,2&#8208;Ni/H and 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shifts enables a two&#8208;fold migration, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#9472;H/C(sp2)&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling.








Abstract
Olefin migratory functionalization is a well&#8208;established strategy for the selective installation of functional groups at remote C(sp3)&#8722;H positions along an alkyl chain. However, prior research has predominantly focused on migration along the alkene component. Herein, we describe a conceptually new migratory coupling strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, where migration selectively occurs along the C(sp2) coupling partner rather than the alkene component, facilitated by a through&#8208;space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. This approach offers a modular three&#8208;component strategy for the selective and efficient construction of densely functionalized alkyl boronates from readily accessible chemicals. Moreover, by integrating the 1,2&#8208;Ni/H shift with the 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift, this platform has been expanded to achieve a two&#8208;fold migration along both the alkene components and the coupling partners, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#9472;H/C(sp2)&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Non&#8208;Precious Metal Catalysts with Gradient Oxidative Dual Sites Boost Bimolecular Activation for Catalytic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering highly active dual sites enhances catalytic oxidation reactions by optimizing bimolecular activation. By immobilizing Cu2+ on NO3&#8315;&#8208;grafted TiO2 and applying thermal treatment, Ti&#8208;doped CuO is successfully synthesized on a TiO2 support. This catalyst, featuring gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites, shows strong potential for low&#8208;temperature catalytic removal of NH&#8323; and various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for environmental applications.








Abstract
Catalytic oxidation emerges as a highly promising and cost&#8208;effective approach for eliminating gaseous pollutants, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial exhaust streams. However, achieving the simultaneous activation of O2 and substrate molecules at low temperatures using non&#8208;precious metal catalysts remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites that enhance bimolecular activation for catalytic oxidation reactions. The catalyst, Ti&#8208;doped CuO, is synthesized on a TiO2 support through the immobilization of Cu2&#8314; on NO3&#8315;&#8208;grafted TiO2, followed by thermal treatment. The resulting gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu sites exhibit exceptional catalytic oxidation activity for NH3 and various VOCs at low temperatures, matching the performance of precious metal&#8208;based catalysts. Notably, during NH&#8323; oxidation, Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti sites enhance the activation of both O&#8322; and NH&#8323;. HNO intermediates formed on Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti sites react with NH intermediates on neighboring Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu sites&#8212;producing N&#8322; and H&#8322;O via an imide mechanism&#8212;which effectively lowers the reaction barrier for catalytic NH&#8323; oxidation. As such, dual sites in non&#8208;precious metal catalysts show promising results for advancing future catalytic oxidation technologies.

         <title>Stepwise Crystallization Synthetic Strategy for Monodisperse InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots with Mid&#8208;Infrared Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stepwise crystallization synthetic strategy for monodisperse InSb colloidal QDs with mid&#8208;infrared absorption is proposed, generating QDs with unprecedented 5.8&#8211;22.2&#160;nm size range and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, InSb QDs with absorption wavelength extending 3000&#160;nm have been realized, a record among environmental&#8208;friendly QDs.

Colloidal InSb quantum dots (QDs) are promising mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection materials due to their suitable bandgap, unparalleled room temperature electronic properties, environmental&#8208;friendly elemental composition, and facile solution processability. However, current InSb QDs suffer from limited spectral absorption within 2&#160;&#181;m, polydisperse QDs populations, and complex size&#8208;selective precipitation for further use, due to the lack of applicable growth theory and synthetic method. Here, we present a novel synthetic strategy for InSb QDs, which is featured by the initial formation of an amorphous intermediate and a subsequent stepwise crystallization process. This strategy enables the achievement of monodisperse InSb QDs with unprecedented 5.8&#8211;22.2&#160;nm size range, and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, we realize the synthesis of InSb QDs with absorption wavelength exceeding 3000&#160;nm, the record among the environmental&#8208;friendly QDs. The results presented here will pave the way toward environmental&#8208;friendly QDs as outstanding infrared optical and optoelectronic materials and push the frontier of solution&#8208;processed QDs into the mid&#8208;infrared regime applications.

         <title>Phthalocyanine Grafting Strategy Induces Strong Intrinsic Electric Fields and Molecule&#8208;Edge Carrier Transport Pathways for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy for optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands is presented through the development of a molecularly functionalized layer, 4EtCz&#8208;Pc, which is characterized by a strong dipole moment and a large internal electric field. This study introduces an efficient approach for facilitating charge carrier separation.








Abstract
Limited charge separation, slow charge mobility, and high electron&#8208;hole recombination rates remain critical challenges impeding the efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. More regrettably, the charge transfer pathways within bulk charge transport are not yet fully understood, and the development of effective strategies to design these pathways remains a significant challenge. Herein, by optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands, we developed a molecularly functionalized layer, 4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;carbazole copper phthalocyanine (4EtCz&#8208;Pc), which is characterized by a strong dipole moment, a large internal electric field, and surprisingly positive electrostatic potential at the edge. When integrated in conjunction with the oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) and the semiconductor photoanode BiVO4 (BVO), it forms a Co(OH)&#8322;/4EtCz&#8208;Pc/BiVO4 composite photoanode system. This innovative photoanode demonstrates an exceptional performance with continuous output for a duration of 15&#160;h. Additionally, a variety of advanced characterization methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM) analyses, confirmed that 4EtCz&#8208;Pc significantly reduces the energy barrier for hole injection from the anode to the active layer during PEC catalysis. This study proposes an effective strategy to optimize the ligands grafted onto phthalocyanine, generating a strong internal electric field that facilitates the formation of new charge transport pathways within the photoanode.

         <title>Accelerated Oxide&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Design for Syngas Conversion by Reaction Phase Diagram Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO) catalysis provides an approach for the direct syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) conversion, with oxides generating intermediates and zeolites catalyzing light olefin formation. Enhancing oxide activity remains a key challenge. We combined DFT calculations, reaction networks, reaction phase diagram (RPD) analysis, and machine learning (ML) to predict high&#8208;performance catalysts. The results align with experiments, accelerating catalyst screening, and offering a versatile strategy for catalyst discovery.








Abstract
Oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept provides an alternative approach for the direct syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) with superior selectivity. Enhancing the activity of oxide components remains a critical and long&#8208;pursued target in this field. However, rational design strategies for optimizing oxides and improving the catalyst performance in such complex reaction networks are still lacking. We employed energetic descriptors such as the adsorption energies of CO* and O* (GadCO* and GadO*) through reaction phase diagram (RPD) analysis to predict the catalyst performance. The prediction was initially validated by the catalytic activity trends measured by experiments. Machine learning (ML) was further utilized to accelerate the screening of new catalysts. Ultimately, Bi&#8208;doped and Sb&#8208;doped ZnCrOx were theoretically predicted as optimized oxide candidates for the OXZEO reaction, which was experimentally verified to be more active than the currently best ZnCrOx counterpart. This work demonstrated enhanced OXZEO catalysts for STO as well as a research paradigm integrating theory and experiment to optimize bifunctional catalysts for complex reaction networks.

         <title>Vinyl&#8208;Functionalized Linear Alkyl Chains in Nonfullerene Acceptors Enable 19.2% Efficiency and Stable As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing acceptors geared toward efficient facilely processed OSCs is imperative for widespread commercialization. Herein, an alkyl linearization strategy was adopted to promote compact and face&#8208;on molecular stacking, and further vinyl functionalization of alkyl terminals provided additional interaction sites to manifest enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of BTP&#8208;V6, resulting in record PCEs of 19.2% and 20.1% for as&#8208;cast and optimal LBL OSCs, respectively.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) is imperative for alleviating costs and complexity for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. Nevertheless, achieving the desired double&#8208;fibril morphology of active layer through single&#8208;step processing is challenging. Herein, two nonfullerene acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;N6 and BTP&#8208;V6, are designed and synthesized to construct as&#8208;cast OSCs by introducing linear alkyl chains adjacent to the pyrrole moiety. The reduction of steric hindrance attributable to linear chains engenders diminished dihedral angles of molecular skeletons, thereby promoting compact and face&#8208;on oriented molecular stacking. Moreover, BTP&#8208;V6 featuring vinyl&#8208;functionalized linear chains manifests additional interaction sites with neighboring molecules to instigate enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking during rapid film&#8208;formation process and engenders the formation of a refined double&#8208;fibril network morphology, which facilitates exciton dissociation, bolsters charge carrier transport, and suppresses recombination loss. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;V6 based device attained a record&#8208;shattering efficiency of 19.2% with a high fill factor (FF) of 80.7%, and also demonstrated robust thermal and shelf stability. Moreover, the meticulously optimized layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) structured devices achieved an excellent efficiency up to 20.1%. This study introduces a viable strategy for alkyl chain modification to fabricate efficient and stable as&#8208;cast devices, with the anticipation of expediting the progression toward widespread commercialization of OSCs.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Hydroallylation of Acrylates Enabled by &#947;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allyl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation of acylates under Cu/Pd synergistic catalysis is reported. The incorporation of a silyl group into allyl acetates precisely controls regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric hindrance. Subsequent transformation of the silyl group in the product enables the regioselective synthesis of allylated products bearing two distinct yet structurally similar aryl groups.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution provides an efficient route to chiral organic molecules featuring an allyl moiety, key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, the use of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl electrophiles has been severely constrained by the challenges of achieving both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity simultaneously. Herein, we present &#947;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allyl acetates as highly effective electrophiles for a regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation, enabling the construction of vicinal stereogenic centers. This method delivers allylated products in 44%&#8211;93% yield with 79:21 to &gt;95:5 dr and 88% to &gt;99% ee. Additionally, the silyl group in the products can be readily converted into other functional groups, such as acyl and aryl groups, enhancing their synthetic utility.

         <title>Catalytically Active Coacervates Sustained Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our findings demonstrate that simple building blocks can access active condensates by exploiting their own catalytic prowess that eventually helps in the realization of an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium spatially confined state under open conditions. The active system, which catalyzes a metabolically relevant C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming reaction, conceptually foreshadows strategies for developing synthetic cells and also suggests their possible candidacy as the earliest protocells.








Abstract
Metabolically active membraneless organelles of extant biology have the capability to maintain their structure under nonequilibrium conditions by leveraging chemical reactions. Herein, we report active coacervates accessed via a mixture of minimal building blocks that featured &#960;&#8208;electron rich short peptide, positively charged aldehyde, and a cyclic ketone under nonequilibrium conditions. Peptide bound with the aldehyde by a dynamic covalent bond and demixed to form coacervates through hydrophobic interactions. Importantly, the short&#8208;peptide could utilize its free amine (&#946;&#8208;alanine) to catalyze C&#9472;C bond formation which eventually led to the depletion of one of the building blocks (aldehyde) via aldol reaction; an intrinsic catalytic role that helped the coacervate to suppress coalescence. Notably, under continuous additions (open system) of the depleting precursors, the active coacervates were able to demonstrate spatial stability for longer duration. This out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior of phase separated droplets in presence of flux of building blocks is reminiscent of the active membraneless organelles seen in contemporary biochemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion Transport in Ultrathin 3D Covalent Organic Framework Nanofluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work well manipulates the ion transport in nanoconfined channels by employing 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs). Owing to their continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics demonstrated high ionic flux and cation selectivity. Toward osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics output an ultrahigh power density of 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency ion transport is essential for both biological and nonbiological processes, including the regulation of cell homeostasis, energy conversion, and mass transfer in chemical industry. Nanofluidic channels are considered ideal platforms for delicate control of ion transport in their unique nanoconfinement, yet currently reported 1D and 2D nanofluidics are subjected to elevated transport resistance due to discontinuous and random channels. Here, we engineer ultrathin, 3D covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) nanofluidics featuring continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, demonstrating superior ion conductance. The energy barrier for ion transport across 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics is exceptionally low, suggesting ultrafast and low&#8208;resistance ion movements. Theoretical calculations indicate that 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics facilitate group adsorption to anions, leading to high energy barriers for anion mobility, thus enhancing ion selectivity and high&#8208;throughput cation transport. In osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics achieve a power density of 217.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 with artificial seawater and river water, potentially scalable to 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient. The proposed 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics offer new avenues for desalination and ion/molecular separation.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Caged Hydrocarbons as Arenes Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality plays a crucial role in the biological interactions, safety, and effectiveness of drugs. The increasing use of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for planar benzene moieties in drug design has heightened the need for asymmetric catalysis strategies to produce chiral caged molecules. This minireview showcases recent progress in this rapidly growing research field. 








Abstract
The utilization of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for arenes, especially the phenyl ring, in bioactive compounds has resulted in significant enhancements in potency, solubility, and metabolic stability. These improvements highlight the potential of C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds as a promising motif for the development of drug candidates. However, this strategy has also increased the structural complexity of these molecules, posing synthetic challenges in controlling the chirality of caged and highly decorated bioactive scaffolds. Over the past two years, remarkable progress has been achieved in catalytic asymmetric methodologies for the synthesis of caged hydrocarbons, significantly advancing their utility in chiral drug discovery and development. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent breakthroughs in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral caged hydrocarbons, encompassing bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes, cubanes, and related three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds. Additionally, we highlight the intriguing applications of enantiomerically pure caged hydrocarbons in biological studies. It is anticipated that this minireview will inspire further advancements in the enantioselective synthesis of these pharmaceutically valuable caged hydrocarbons.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;Like (Cyclo)Addition of Small Organic Molecules to a Stable Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azomethine ylide is shown to activate a series of H&#9472;E (E&#9552;B, Si, Al, O) and B&#9472;B bonds in &#8220;Frustrated Lewis pair&#8221; (FLP)&#8208;like fashion. A transfer hydrogenation from NH3&#8226;BH3 is also accomplished. DFT analyses suggest each activation route to be mechanistically distinct than others. The ylide also undergoes 3+2&#8208;cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles, among which the facile insertion of CS2 but non&#8208;insertion of CO2 is compelling but justified by computing the associated energetics.








Abstract
Azomethine ylides are 1,3&#8208;dipolar zwitterions typically used for constructing N&#8208;heterocycles by 3+2&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. We report here a pyridyl&#8208;tethered isolable azomethine ylide (AY) that activates a series of H&#8722;E bonds (E&#9552;B, Si, Al, O) in FLP&#8208;like fashion. The reactions are probed mechanistically by DFT calculations and each case appears to be distinct from others. While the HBpin activation is stepwise, the same of PhSiH3 is concerted. The AlH3 activation is also stepwise but takes place across the 1,5&#8208;(C+/N&#8722;) dipole. The hydrolysis of AY fits better with a &#8220;relay&#8221; mechanism with two H2O molecules working in tandem. The B&#8722;B bond of B2pin2 is also cleaved but in an intriguingly different way, by delivering both the Bpin moieties at the carbenic site. Though the challenging H2 activation fails, a transfer hydrogenation of AY by NH3&#8226;BH3 is readily achieved. AY also undergoes cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles including unactivated alkene and alkynes. In this regard, AY makes an interesting distinction between CO2 and CS2 by staying inert to the former but easily cycloadding the latter. DFT analysis justifies this dichotomy by showing the cycloaddition of CO2 as thermodynamically disfavored.

         <title>Mesoporous Enhanced Heterostructured Halide Solid Electrolytes with High Air Stability and High Abundance for Sustainable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorides and fluorides solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) exhibit&#160;contrasting extremes in ionic conductivity and moisture sensitivity. In light of these conflicting factors, we introduce a NaCl&#8208;based SE reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3&#160;(denoted as HS&#8208;AlF3), leading to a heterostructure halide architecture, designated as NHxy (where x/y represents the mass ratio of NaCl to HS&#8208;AlF3). The high dispersion of NaCl and HS&#8208;AlF3 during&#160;mechanochemical process enables the generation of defective and amorphous structures and nanodomains in NHxy along with F&#8208;Cl anion substitution effect at grain boundaries. These factors collectively promote&#160;Na&#8208;ion transport in NHxy, especially along the NaCl&#8208;based heterostructures with AlF3 and NaF. This class of SEs achieves high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8208;4 S/cm at 30 &#176;C. Specifically, NH54 exhibits excellent long&#8208;term air stability at 35% relative humidity, maintaining high ion&#8208;conductivity without degradation. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD/kg when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding Na//Na symmetric cells demonstrate the stable cycling for at least 1000 h at 0.1 mA/cm2. The Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 cells assembled with the NH54 after air exposure exhibit the remarkable longevity, sustaining over 400 cycles at 60 &#176;C. The conversion&#8208;type Na/NH54/FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh/g.</dc:description>

In light of these conflicting factors, we introduce a NaCl-based SE reinforced by mesoporous &#945;-AlF3&#160;(denoted as HS-AlF3), leading to a heterostructure halide architecture, designated as NHxy (where x/y represents the mass ratio of NaCl to HS-AlF3). The high dispersion of NaCl and HS-AlF3 during&#160;mechanochemical process enables the generation of defective and amorphous structures and nanodomains in NHxy along with F-Cl anion substitution effect at grain boundaries. These factors collectively promote&#160;Na-ion transport in NHxy, especially along the NaCl-based heterostructures with AlF3 and NaF. This class of SEs achieves high ionic conductivity approaching 10-4 S/cm at 30 &#176;C. Specifically, NH54 exhibits excellent long-term air stability at 35% relative humidity, maintaining high ion-conductivity without degradation. The raw material cost of this Na-based electrolyte is less than $10 USD/kg when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding Na//Na symmetric cells demonstrate the stable cycling for at least 1000 h at 0.1 mA/cm2. The Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 cells assembled with the NH54 after air exposure exhibit the remarkable longevity, sustaining over 400 cycles at 60 &#176;C. The conversion-type Na/NH54/FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh/g.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore engineering through chemical environment modification is vital for developing industrial porous materials. Understanding the effects of substitutions in isoreticular porous coordination&#8208;polymers&#8212;such as steric hindrance, vibrational capabilities, electronic influences, and hydropathy&#8212;is key to elucidating structure&#8208;property relationships. However, accurately assessing the impact of functional groups on properties remains challenging due to limitations in current methodologies. In this study, we designed a series of titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination&#8208;polymers with various functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. The unique spatial arrangement and electronic distribution of isophthalate and its functional groups provide an ideal platform to address these challenges. We conducted extensive investigations combining experimental methods with computational simulations to explore how pore engineering affects adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings not only tackle the synthesis challenge of isostructural titanium&#8208;coordination polymers but also offer new insights into understanding structure&#8208;property relationships achieved through modulation of their chemical environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Multi&#8208;interface Chemistry by Functional Carbon Dots for High&#8208;Performance Composite Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical strength and unstable interface structure are still the main factors hindering the practical application of polymer solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs).&#160; In this work, we have developed a unique composite filler (LLZTOCDs) for solid polymer electrolytes to address these challenges through synergistic regulation of multi&#8208;interface chemistry. The LLZTOCDs is prepared via thermal treatment of N, S, F&#8208;codoped carbon dots (NSFCDs) and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) inorganic electrolyte, here the detrimental Li2CO3 on the LLZTO surface is converted into a fast ion&#8208;conducting and an electron&#8208;insulating interlayer of LiF and Li3N, and the carbon dots self&#8208;assemble into a functional organophilic coating on the outermost layer, which acts as a bridge between the LLZTO and the polymer. This unique structure enhances the compatibility and ion&#8208;exchange kinetics between the LLZTOCDs and the polymer, significantly improving the mechanical strength and Li+ transport. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed in&#8208;situ at the LLZTOCDs interface provide an anion confinement effect, increasing lithium salt dissociation and enhancing the Li+ transference number to 0.85. Therefore, the solid battery constructed with LLZTOCDs exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, long&#8208;cycle life, and high ionic conductivity (1.96 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C), providing a feasible strategy for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Internal Exciton Confinement for Efficient CdZnSeS&#8208;Based Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdZnSeS/ZnS blue quantum dots were synthesized by growing a giant alloy CdZnSeS core with gradient composition and a low Fermi energy level position. The constructed blue quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLED) had a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24%, which is the highest value reported so far.








Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are thought to be the base for next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the performance of blue&#8208;emitting QLEDs still falls behind those of green and red ones, which can be attributed to the energy loss from Auger recombination and the strong coupling of excitons with surface states. Blue quantum dots (QDs) with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores are expected to improve the internal confinement of excitons due to the nonmonotonical energy landscape of their conduction band, while they haven't shown high performance in QLEDs due to insufficient optimization of their shell structures. In this work, giant CdZnSeS alloy cores were synthesized by diffusing Zn atoms into CdSeS cores, so that the core/shell lattice stress was released due to the optimized gradient compositions. As a result, exciton transfer and Auger recombination are both suppressed, leading to a breakthrough external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24% in blue QLEDs with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores. Compared to the more extensively studied blue quantum dots with CdSeZn alloy cores, blue QLEDs with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores also benefit from the suppressed Fermi level and nonmonotonical energy landscape of the conduction band minimum (CBM), which are crucial for confining the wavefunctions of the excitons. The improved exciton confinement explained the superior performances of giant CdZnSeS alloy cores over CdSeZn cores in blue QLEDs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer to suppress dendrite growth is an effective approach in Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries. Traditional SEI layers are limited by their simple structure and composition, enabling only one functionality of either providing nucleation sites or facilitating desolvation. In this study, a pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator is constructed by kinetics&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembling zincophilic micelles and zincophobic metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The closely packed soft micelles, in conjunction with the hard MOF host particles, form a multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure that accelerates adsorption, pre&#8208;desolvation, and subsequent desolvation processes, facilitating the (002) crystal plane dendrite&#8208;free deposition. As a result, stable cycling over 1900 hours (31 mV polarization) in symmetric cell and 5200 cycles in the Zn//Cu battery (99.8% coulombic efficiency) can be achieved. These findings will effectively promote the development of stable and long&#8208;cycling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Based &#8220;Transfer Stations&#8221; at Carbon&#8208;Immobilized Metal Particles Enable Rapid Hydrogen Transfer for Efficient Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction of surface metal species with the solution plays a key role in engineering heterogeneous catalytic processes. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of L&#8208;histidine&#8208;coordinated PdAg nanoparticles (4.03 &#177; 0.08 nm) anchored on pristine carbon supports (denoted as PdAg&#8208;NH2/C) and their use for formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). Significant acceleration of FAD related to the histidine is observed, and the enhancement mechanism is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The presence of L&#8208;histidine at metal sites promotes rapid binding of formic acid molecules due to acid&#8208;base interactions. The local enrichment of both proton and formate at the metal&#8208;solution interfaces promotes the subsequent formate decomposition and hydride transfer to the metal surface. The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an amino&#8208;modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production. The optimal Pd1Ag1&#8208;NH2/C catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency of 6493.5 h&#8208;1 at 333 K based on the total amount of Pd, together with a H2 selectivity of 100%. This study emphasizes the critical role of optimizing local transport pathways near catalytic centers chemically and further provide insights to the rational development of heterogeneous catalysts for FAD technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic C&#8208;N Coupling for Efficient Cyclohexanone Oxime Syn&#8208;thesis from Ambient Air by Supported Molecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from rich nitrogen resources is a promising alternative to traditional industrial processes. However, the difficulties in unravelling atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanism and managing selective C&#8208;N coupling pose great challenges to realize considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C&#8208;N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. Herein, molecular catalysts are demonstrated unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e. iron bis(pyridyl)&#8208;bipyridineamine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2&#8208; and cyclohexanone, attaining mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 mgcat&#8208;1, FE of 77.3 % and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H&#8208;cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8208;, and catalyzed selective NO2&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH reduction for C&#8208;N bond in&#8208;situ. Further integrating plasma&#8208;driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 mgcat&#8208;1 on FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8208;1, much lower than the breakeven point (~$10000 ton&#8208;1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

However, the difficulties in unravelling atomic-scale catalytic mechanism and managing selective C-N coupling pose great challenges to realize considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C-N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. Herein, molecular catalysts are demonstrated unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e. iron bis(pyridyl)-bipyridineamine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2- and cyclohexanone, attaining mass-specific efficiency of 87.00 mg h-1 cm-2 mgcat-1, FE of 77.3 % and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H-cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2-, and catalyzed selective NO2--to-NH2OH reduction for C-N bond in-situ. Further integrating plasma-driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73 mg h-1 cm-2 mgcat-1 on FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton-1, much lower than the breakeven point (~$10000 ton-1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable Nanoparticle Conversion Pathway to Monodisperse Polyelemental High Entropy Alloy, Intermetallic, and Multiphase Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyelemental nanoparticles (PE NPs), those consisting of four or more elements, exhibit unique properties from synergistic compositional effects. Examples include high entropy alloys, high entropy intermetallics, and multiphase types, including Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. While colloidal syntheses offer excellent structural control for mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;elemental compositions, achieving the same control for PE NPs remains challenging. Here, this challenge is addressed with a NP conversion strategy wherein different types of PE NPs &#8211; including high entropy alloy, high entropy intermetallic, and multi&#8208;phase Janus nanoparticles &#8211; are achieved through thermal transformation of readily synthesized colloidal core&#8208;shell NPs. Through systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity to the core&#8208;shell precursor NPs, along with atomistic simulations that probe phase stabilities, the final mixing states of the various NPs are found to be governed by the balance between the enthalpy and entropy of mixing. Our annealing method allows&#160;intermediate states of mixing to be trapped, creating distinct surface ensembles that were evaluated as catalysts. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report colloidally derived precursor NPs enabling the synthesis of all types of PE NPs in a single process. This NP conversion strategy offers a general route to diverse PE NPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unnatural Triggers Converted from Tetrazine&#8208;Attached Sialic Acid for Activation of Optoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing chemical groups on cell membranes through metabolic glycoengineering of unnatural sugars is an effective means to solve the issue of insufficient or even lack of targets in cancer theranostics. Herein, we address the limitations by developing a tetrazine precursor (SiaTz) based on a non&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold and then utilizing it to create unnatural tetrazine triggers on the surface of cancer cells. SiaTz exhibits a good balance between the stability and reaction kinetics under physiological conditions and can be efficiently converted into corresponding tetrazine trigger through bypassing several size&#8208;limiting steps in metabolic glycoengineering process. We also prepare a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept theranostic combination of a trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivative (CyTCO) and a thermal&#8208;sensitive drug 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane]&#8208;dihydrochloride (AIPH) to verify the activation function of tetrazine triggers in theranostics of orthotopic and metastatic tumors. In the presence of tetrazine triggers, CyTCO can be activated via bioorthogonal reaction to induce optoacoustic signal enhancement, enabling high&#8208;contrast diagnostic imaging and precise tumor localization to guide subsequent treatments. Tetrazine trigger&#8208;activated CyTCO displays high photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, which can cause an obvious increase in temperature under laser irradiation and then initiate AIPH decomposition to produce toxic radicals for combined therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Multifunctionalities into a Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is still challenging. Herein, integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich organic cages and the photoactive porphyrin moieties together, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF), Cage&#8208;PorCOF, is successfully synthesized. After incorporating metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) into the cage&#8208;based COF, Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) are subsequently constructed for the CO2 photoreduction. Catalytic experiments show impressive performance in CO2 photoreduction with CO generation rates of up to 48,748 and 28,446 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the first initiating hour for Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) respectively, which is attributed to the synergistic effects from CO2&#8208;affinity of the porous frameworks and incorporated metal atoms, the light&#8208;absorption and charge separation ability of metalloporphyrin groups as well as the fully exposed single&#8208;atomic catalytic sites confirmed by both experimental and theoretical analyses. This study demonstrates that by the integration of multiple functionalities into 3D porous solids, highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 conversion can be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12:&#160;A Geometrically Closed, but Electronically Open Triple&#8208;Shell Icosahedral Gold Cluster and its Geometrically Open Counterpart</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aesthetic Platonic solids have been known since ancient times and the structure of all five Platonic solids are also found in chemical compounds. While gold sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and gold nanoparticles with an icosahedral structure have been known for a long time, a multi&#8208;shell icosahedral gold cluster at the intermediate size between 13 and thousands of atoms has been elusive. Here we present the synthesis and crystallographic characterization of the first three&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)121. The gold core in 1 is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates, but surprisingly no staple motifs are formed. A second cluster, Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)122, cocrystallizes and is identified as having a closed electronic shell, but can be considered as a geometrically open pendant of 1. The unique clusters are characterized experimentally by EDX, UV/Vis, DLS, EPR, and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

A second cluster, Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)122, cocrystallizes and is identified as having a closed electronic shell, but can be considered as a geometrically open pendant of 1. The unique clusters are characterized experimentally by EDX, UV/Vis, DLS, EPR, and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>S&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced "Proton Fence Effect" Enables Selectivity Switching Between CH4 and CO in Photo&#8208;Assisted CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upcycling CO2 into high&#8208;value C1 products is impressive for achieving carbon neutrality and energy sustainability, while rational modulation of C1 product selectivity is one of the biggest challenges in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) due to the competing reaction pathways and thermodynamic limitation. Here, we showcase a &#8216;proton fence&#8217; strategy enabled by in situ adsorbed *OH on sulfur vacancies (SV) to ultraselectively switch the C1 product between CH4 and CO during CO2RR, with Faraday efficiency of 93.6% and 95.3%, respectively. In situ measurements uncover that the photo&#8208;generated holes counteract Cu2+ electroreduction to retain the intact structure of CuInS2/CuS, while *OH dissociated from water can spontaneously anchor toward SV to hinder the local proton migration, completely circumventing multiproton products. Meanwhile, the preferential desorption of *CO from Cu centers adjacent to the *OH&#8208;anchored SV renders the exclusive formation of CO. In the absence of SV, *CO can be further hydrogenated in a lower free energy/even spontaneously to afford CH4. The proposed proton confinement effect furnishes a promising reference for the selectivity control of eCO2RR, and the photo&#8208;assisted electroreductive protocol demonstrates a paradigm of in situ stabilization of electron&#8208;intolerant catalytic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Activities of CYP152 Peroxygenases towards Non&#8208;carboxylic Substrates Reveal Novel Substrate Recognition Mechanism and Catalytic Versatility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring and exploiting the catalytic promiscuity of enzymes is a central topic and captivating challenge in enzymology. CYP152 peroxygenases are attractive biocatalysts for diverse reactions under mild conditions using H2O2 as cofactor. However, their substrate scope is limited by a carboxyl group required for substrate assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis, following the well&#8208;accepted principle that heme&#8208;dependent H2O2&#8208;utilizing enzymes employ a carboxyl group within their active sites to facilitate H2O2 activation. Herein, we reveal for the first time that several CYP152 family members can directly degrade various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group, exhibiting novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities. Through crystal structure analysis, isotope tracing experiments, and QM/MM calculations, we elucidate that the phenolic hydroxyl group activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent(s) functionally replaces the carboxyl group, forming hydrogen bonds with the conserved arginine leading to Compound I formation. The oxygen atom of the newly formed hydroxyl group originates from water, bypassing the conventional oxygen rebound step. These findings provide first insights into the mechanisms of P450 peroxygenases towards non&#8208;carboxylic substrates, expanding our knowledge of biological C&#8208;H activation and C&#8208;halogen bond cleavage beyond canonical P450 reactions. This discovery holds immense potential for harnessing these enzymes in innovative strategies for industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable and Ultrathin Dual Entangled Network Polymer Electrolytes for Safe Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying ultrathin and flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance is crucial for scale&#8208;up production of solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) metal batteries (SSMBs). However, the challenges of poor processing scalability, insufficient intrinsic mechanical strength, and limited ionic transport capacity remain unaddressed. Herein, an ultrathin 9.7 &#956;m solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane featuring a dual&#8208;polymer entangled network is meticulously engineered through an arrayed multi&#8208;nozzle electrospinning technique with a swelling&#8208;hot pressing process using polyacrylonitrile and poly(ether&#8208;block&#8208;amide), which exhibits an exceptional voltage tolerance, enhanced tensile strength, and superior thermal stability. The soft ether oxygens segments in multiblock copolymers complex with Na+ to promote the rapid hopping transport of Na+. Meanwhile, interconnected electronegative channels based on carbonyl and cyanogen groups serve as Na+ conduits to smooth ion fluctuations and accelerate Na+ selective conduction simultaneously. The obtained inorganic&#8208;organic composite solid electrolyte interface with the improved mechanical strength of ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolytes effectively suppresses Na dendrites with low overpotential over 500 h. The solid&#8208;state cells paired with layered oxides deliver a capacity retention of over 91.1% between 25 &#176;C and 65 &#176;C, and assembled pouch cells exhibit impressive energy density over 100 cycles, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale application of ultrathin structure in the SSMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism for Unconventional Anodic Reaction of Aldehyde&#160;Oxidation for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anodic reactions&#160;involving non&#8208;faradaic&#160;process&#160;has significantly expanded the potential application of anodic&#160;oxidation half&#8208;reactions.&#160;Metallic Cu&#160;materials can catalyze an unconventional anodic aldehyde&#160;oxidation&#160;reaction involving the non&#8208;faradaic&#160;H2&#160;production (AOR&#8208;H2). AOR&#8208;H2&#160;has distinct advantages of ultra&#8208;low thermodynamic potentials and high value&#8208;added redox products, etc., but the question of exactly how reduction steps occur during AOR&#8208;H2, is something which has long puzzled scientists. Here we illustrate the novel synergistic mechanism&#160;of non&#8208;electrochemical/electrochemical redox steps in AOR&#8208;H2. Aldehyde undergoes hydration, deprotonation, and spontaneous C&#8208;H homolytic cleavage to generate H2, and then is electrochemically oxidized to form carboxylate. Decorating Cu catalysts with metallic&#160;Pt species, supported by theoretical calculations, leads to a twelvefold increase in the intrinsic activity&#160;of AOR&#8208;H2.&#160;This work&#160;inspires&#160;researchers&#160;to&#160;develop novel&#160;cathodic and anodic reactions&#160;involving the non&#8208;faradaic&#160;process&#160;for breaking through the limit&#160;of&#160;existing&#160;energy conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Mg2+ Dication Weakly Stabilized/Coordinated in Solution: Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity and Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first soluble and stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating and chemically robust carborate anions [HexCB11Cl11]&#8208; is described. Mg[HexCB11Cl11]2 (1), prepared by reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with 2 equiv of [Ph3C][HexCB11Cl11], consists, in the solid state, of a central Mg2+ surrounded by two [HexCB11Cl11]&#8208; anions. In solution, experimental and molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center. Yet, reflecting weak anion/cation interactions, species 1 polymerizes 1&#8208;hexene and coordinates alkynes. However, 1 displays no reaction with HSiEt3 at room temperature, consistent with a low hydridicity of the hard (HSAB) Mg2+ center. Contrasting with 1 (FIA = 264 kJ mol&#8208;1; FIA: Fluoride Ion Affinity), salt Mg[(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]2 (2), incorporating the more basic ammoniododecaborate [(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]&#8208; anion, is&#160; less Lewis acidic (FIA = 214.7 kJ mol&#8208;1) and unreactive with alkenes/alkynes. Salt 1 effectively catalyzes alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation via an initial alkene/alkyne coordination/initiation, as suggested by experimental and computational data. It does also efficiently catalyze (with a catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol%) the hydrosilylation of CO2 to CH4 in the presence of HSiEt3. Salt 1 promotes the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, and it is an active imine hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of H2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Human H ferritin (HuHf) has excellent potential as a nanocarrier for the selective delivery of anticancer metal&#8208;based drugs to tumour cells. Here, we addressed the interaction of the gold monocarbene compound Au(NHC)Cl with HuHf by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS)&#160;measurements, which provide the metalation state of the protein subunits and demonstrate the involvement of protein cysteines in gold binding. The adduct between Au(NHC)Cl and HuHf was studied by cryo&#8208;EM measurements, resulting in a high&#8208;resolution 3D density map at 1.51 &#197;. The cryo&#8208;EM structure shows a novel tetranuclear gold(I) cluster, located in a surface pocket of each subunit where it is bound to Cys90 and Cys102. The short inter&#8208;metal distances are diagnostic of the occurrence of aurophilic interactions. The present work demonstrates the usefulness of cryo&#8208;EM to investigate the interactions between metal&#8208;based drugs and their protein targets/carriers also leveraging the strong signal of transition metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Staggered ABC&#8208;Stacking Cobalt&#8208;Triptycene Framework for Accelerating CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks are highly efficient photocatalysts due to their highly tunable structures and favorable electronic properties. However, achieving control over framework stacking arrangements, such as the staggered ABC&#8208;stacking, presents significant challenges. This difficulty arises from the inherently unfavorable energetics of the ABC arrangement and weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions compared to other stacking modes. Herein, a cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework with a staggered ABC&#8208;stacking arrangement was successfully synthesized in the aqueous phase, achieving a 90% yield. Experimental evaluations revealed that this framework achieved a CO production rate of 4.43 mmol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, which is comparable to the most reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Moreover, density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the ABC&#8208;stacking cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework exhibits lower activation energy (0.079 eV) for water molecules, reduced Gibbs free energies for key intermediates *COOH (0.76 eV) and *H (0.73 eV), and the highest reaction rate increment (7.488 times). Furthermore, principal component analysis reveals a strong correlation between the CO production rate and factors such as the Ik value, optical bandgap, and &#916;G*H, revising the previous held notion that &#916;G*COOH is the primary determinant of catalytic performance. These results offer valuable insights into the design principles of advanced photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Transaminase&#8208;Triggered Cascades for the Synthesis and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to complex indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids is described that relies on transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael methodology. In one case, a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction enables dynamic kinetic resolution.








Abstract
Biocatalysis is now a well&#8208;established branch of catalysis and the growing toolbox of natural, evolved and designer enzymes is enabling chemistry previously deemed inaccessible. However, most enzyme methodologies have been developed for functional group interconversions, such as the conversion of a ketone into an amine or alcohol, and do not result in the generation of significant 3D molecular complexity. The application of enzyme&#8208;triggered reaction cascade methodologies has the potential to transform simple substrates into complex sp3&#8208;rich molecules in one step. Herein, we describe a single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to high&#8208;value, complex indolizidine, and quinolizidine alkaloids, which relies on a transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction. This approach allows access to architecturally complex, natural&#8208;product&#8208;like N&#8208;heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. Significantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase plays a dual role in generating complex N&#8208;heterocycles and where a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3&#8208;rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing five stereocenters, as single isomers.

         <title>Efficient Semitransparent Organic Solar Modules with Exceptional Diurnal Stability Through Asymmetric Interaction Induced by Symmetric Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetric molecular structure of 4FY has been shown to induce an &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221;, which promotes a higher degree of molecular packing than in Y6. The asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area semitransparent organic solar modules that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions. 








Abstract
The symmetry&#8208;breaking design strategy of nonfullerene acceptor can improve the performance of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs). However, no report exists on the &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221; induced by symmetric molecular structure in nonfullerene acceptors. Herein, we showcase that 2D fluorophenyl outer groups in symmetric 4FY promote dipole&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly through asymmetric molecular interactions, resulting in a tighter packed structure than Y6 with the same symmetric geometry. Such unique properties lead to high&#8208;performance layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs, accompanied by simultaneously reduced energy and recombination losses and improved charge&#8208;related characteristics. ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY achieve notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.81%, average visible transmittance of 45.43%, and light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.91%. Moreover, exceptional diurnal cycling stability is observed in the ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY with much prolonged T80 up to 134&#160;h, which is about 17 times greater than the reference PCE10&#8208;2F/Y6. Lastly, we fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar modules based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY (active area of 18 cm2), which shows PCE of 6.78% and the highest LUE of 3.10% to date for all&#8208;narrow bandgap semitransparent organic solar modules. This work demonstrates that asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area ST&#8208;OSCs that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions.

         <title>Molecule Differentiation Encoding Microscopy to Dissect Dense Biomolecules in Cellular Nanoenvironments below Spatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule differentiation encoding microscopy by orthogonal tandem repeat DNA identifiers is reported to digitize the dense biomolecules below spatial resolution. The method encodes each copy of the same biomolecules into different types of DNA barcodes based on stochastic multiplexed reactions. It transforms the overlap of the same spectrum into the overlap of different spectra, overcoming the common challenge of optical crowding.








Abstract
Cellular biomolecules may exhibit dense distribution and organization at the nanoscale to govern vital biological processes. However, it remains a common challenge to digitize the spatially dense biomolecules under the spatial resolution of microscopies. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle method, molecule differentiation encoding microscopy by orthogonal tandem repeat DNA identifiers is reported, to resolve the copy numbers of dense biomolecules in cellular nanoenvironments. The method encodes each copy of the same biomolecules into different types of DNA barcodes based on stochastic multiplexed reactions. It can transform the overlap of the same spectrum into the overlap of different spectra. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to automatically quantitate overlapping spots and individual spots. Using this method, RNAs in the cytoplasm, DNA epigenetic modifications in the cell nucleus, and glycans and glycoRNAs on the cell surface are dissected, respectively. It is found that all these biomolecules present dense distribution with diverse degrees in crowded cellular nanoenvironments. Especially, an average 17% copies of U1 glycoRNA of single cells are gathered in various nano environments on the cell surface. The strategy provides a powerful tool for digitally quantitative visualization of dense biomolecules below the spatial resolution of microscopies and can provide insights into underlying functions and mechanisms of the dense distribution information.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangements of the Alkaloid Intermediate Geissoschizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19E&#8208;geissoschizine is a key precursor in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Using enzymatic assays and gene silencing, three CYPs were identified from C. roseus that oxidize this compound to four alkaloid scaffolds: strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline, and mavacurane. Mutational analysis reveals how active&#8208;site changes fine&#8208;tune product specificity, highlighting nature's strategy for metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Plants can generate structural diversity by enzymatic rearrangement of a central intermediate. 19E&#8208;geissoschizine is one such chemically versatile intermediate that plays a central role in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Here we report how 19E&#8208;geissoschizine undergoes oxidative transformations to generate four distinct alkaloid scaffolds through the action of three biosynthetic enzymes. Using in vitro enzymatic assays and gene silencing, we demonstrate how these three cytochrome P450 enzymes in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus transform 19E&#8208;geissoschizine into strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline&#8208;type, and mavacurane&#8208;type alkaloids. We use mutational analysis to show how minimal changes to the active site of these similar enzymes modulate product specificity. This work highlights how substrate reactivity and enzyme mutations work synergistically to generate chemical diversity.

         <title>A Bench&#8208;Stable Fluorophosphine Nickel(0) Complex and Its Catalytic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein present the synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable Ni(0) complex, [Ni(PFPh2)4], stabilized by vastly underexplored fluorophosphine ligands. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and Kumada&#8208;Tamao&#8208;Corriu cross&#8208;coupling reactions as well as in Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#9472;N bond formation reactions, indicates its promising potential as alternative to conventional Ni(0) sources.








Abstract
We herein present a fluorophosphine&#8208;based nickel(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] (1), which is highly stable in air and water. [Ni(PFPh2)4] can be obtained from a one&#8208;pot reaction of [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 with Ph2P(&#9552;O)&#8211;PPh2, involving a unique in situ reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) and a simultaneous fluorination by the BF4&#8722; anion. This complex does not only incorporate a nickel center in the zero&#8208;oxidation state, resulting from a Ni(II) precursor, but also includes fluorophosphine ligands, which typically disproportionate immediately in solution. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] as highly stable Ni(0) pre&#8208;catalyst in combination with additional phosphine ligands, such as dppf (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene), in various coupling reactions uncovers its high catalytic activity and versatility, which is superior to [Ni(COD)2] (COD&#9552;cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene) as conventional Ni(0) source.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Synthesis of Sulfonic Acid Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Achieved by COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF Transformation for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#9472;C bond linked COF have synthesized through the photothermal catalysis under visible light, which can be a photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. A new photoinduced thermally&#8208;driven postsynthetic strategy has been developed to construct COFs via crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation, the COF showing an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of benzylamine.








Abstract
Although photothermal catalysis is a clean, efficient, and green approach to access organic products, its application in the synthesis and transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains unprecedented. Herein, we report the photothermal catalytic synthesis of C&#9472;C bond linked COF under visible light, which can be a reusable photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. Furthermore, we have developed a new postsynthetic modification strategy to construct COFs by photoinduced thermally&#8208;driven hydroamination via crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. The obtained COF containing sulfonic acid group showed an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of alkyl arenes under mild reaction conditions. These results not only enrich the COF synthetic methodology but also open a new route to access COFs in a green and sustainable way.

         <title>Indole&#8208;Quinoline Transmutation Enabled by a Formal Rhodium Carbynoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt developed as a trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:) precursor can be utilized in single&#8208;atom skeletal editing, rapidly enabling indole&#8208;quinoline transmutation in a unique manner. N&#8208;unprotected and 2&#8208;nonsubstituted indoles were well&#8208;tolerated, thus providing a complementary approach to other recently developed protocols.








Abstract
Skeleton editing is an emerging and powerful tool in organic chemistry because it can simplify synthetic procedures towards complex molecules. Herein, we present an approach for indole&#8208;quinoline transmutation through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;carbon insertion into the C2(sp2)&#9472;C3(sp2) bond of an indole with an &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt that we developed. This protocol involves a formal trifluoromethyl rhodium carbynoid (CF3C+ = Rh) resembling a trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:), allowing facile access to an array of quinolines in moderate to high yields. Potential applications in the late&#8208;stage skeletal editing of pharmaceutical and natural product derivatives, preparation of adapalene analogs, scaled&#8208;up synthesis, and transformations of products are highlighted. Finally, a computational study was conducted to support the envisioned mechanism.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Interactions Between Hydrophobic Tag&#8208;Conjugated DNA Nanoprobes and Cell Membrane Facilitates ATP Imaging in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a conformational switching&#8208;based strategy was developed for dynamically modulate interactions between hydrophobic tag&#8208;conjugated DNA nanoprobes (HT&#8208;DNPs) and cell membrane, enabling selective and efficient functionalization of target cells with HT&#8208;DNPs. The constructed HT&#8208;DNPs could be selectively anchored to target cells or accumulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for specific ATP imaging.








Abstract
Conjugating hydrophobic tags to oligonucleotides facilitates the swift and efficient creation of membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoprobes. However, the membrane&#8208;anchoring of these hydrophobic tag&#8208;conjugated DNA nanoprobes (HT&#8208;DNPs) lacks specificity among different cell types. To address this challenge, we herein report a conformational switching&#8208;based strategy for selectively anchoring HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells. In our design, HT&#8208;DNPs with extended or compact conformations possess weak or strong interactions with cell membrane, respectively. Thus, interactions between HT&#8208;DNPs and cell membrane can be dynamically controlled by altering the conformation of HT&#8208;DNPs. Initially, the extended HT&#8208;DNPs exhibit poor membrane&#8208;anchoring ability that is impute to their weak hydrophobic interactions with cell membrane. However, in slightly acidic conditions, HT&#8208;DNPs intercalated with DNA i&#8208;motif&#8208;forming sequences can fold into a compact conformation and exhibit strong hydrophobicity, thus achieving selective and efficient anchoring of HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells in such environments. Utilizing this method, we constructed HT&#8208;DNPs for imaging of ATP in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our results indicate that these HT&#8208;DNPs can effectively accumulate at tumor sites for specific ATP imaging following intravenous injection. This strategy paves new avenues for the selective and efficient functionalization of target cells with various membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanostructures, including DNA nanoprobes, DNA nanocircuits, and DNA nanomachines.

         <title>Artificial Cation&#8211;Chloride Co&#8208;Transporters for Chloride&#8208;Facilitated Lithium/Magnesium Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial cation&#8211;chloride co&#8208;transporter was realized using a porous organic framework with weak surface charge and narrow pores that achieved the simultaneous selective separation of Cl&#8722; and alkaline ions. With the help of this co&#8208;transport, high&#8208;flux and highly selective Li+ sieving was achieved from NaCl&#8208;rich brines, out&#8208;performing reported membranes and reversing the current industrial brine&#8208;based lithium extraction process.








Abstract
Inspired by nature, many artificial ion sieving materials have been developed, shedding light on the next&#8208;generation ion, e.g., Li+, extraction applications. Artificial co&#8208;transporters remain difficult to construct since they have a much more complex ion&#8208;sieving property. For example, the cation&#8211;chloride co&#8208;transporters have both alkaline ion and chloride ion selectivity but no alkaline ion/chloride ion selectivity. We here demonstrate a method to construct artificial co&#8208;transporters, using a porous organic framework membrane which has a relatively disordered stacking structure and rich quaternary ammonium groups paired with counter&#8208;ions. This imparts the membrane with extremely narrow pores (&#8764;0.3&#160;nm) and almost no surface charge, enabling size&#8208;based high alkaline ion selectivity against other cations, high Cl&#8722; selectivity against other anions, but almost no alkaline ion/Cl&#8722; selectivity. Such synchronized sieving property allows us to enhance the extraction of high&#8208;value cations (Li+) by simply feeding excessive low&#8208;value anions (Cl&#8722;). As a demonstration, we realized high&#8208;flux (0.44&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) and highly selective (selectivity: 185) Li+/Mg2+ separation by reversing the current industrial brine&#8208;based lithium extraction process, i.e., sieving Li+ before removing NaCl.

         <title>Adaptive Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S Clusters: Consistent Redox Behavior versus Reversible Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are critical in a number of important biological processes, where their structural integrity can be maintained or reversibly transformed. However, it remains ambiguous how Fe&#8208;S clusters adapt to electrochemical demands for electron transport through redox&#8208;induced structural transformations. In this study, three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters comprising similar or distinct cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in different oxidation states have been synthesized. These chemically interconvertible clusters exhibit strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, irrespective of the structural differences in the core. Subsequent investigations indicate that the chloride ligand in cluster 2 is spontaneously replaced by the solvent molecule in solution and therefore only the solvent&#8208;ligated species exhibits an observable redox behavior that is almost identical to that of the chloride&#8208;free clusters 3 and 4. A comprehensive analysis of the redox behavior suggests that the intriguing redox events in the CV curves can be correlated to the electrochemical transformations between the chloride&#8208;free clusters. This work provides an insight into how Fe&#8208;S clusters maintain a stable redox behavior through structural transformations that can facilitate electron transfer in certain cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Filler with Anion&#8208;Constrained Centers in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries based on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is hindered by their low Li+ conductivity and safety risks posed by the growth of lithium dendrites. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we designed a cationic porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;142) and introduced it as a filler into SPEs to obtain a composite polymer electrolyte&#160;(CPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE. The cationic imidazolium sites could effectively constrain the movement of anions through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the design of the imidazolium&#8208;based building units allowed the cationic sites to be located within the framework, which promoted the transport of Li+. Density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which PAF&#8208;142 promoted the dissociation of lithium salts and enhanced Li+ transport.&#160;Benefiting from these advantages, the Li+ conductivity of quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte&#160;(QCPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE reached 8.77&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 20 &#176;C. Additionally, a stable interface with abundant inorganic&#160;components was formed between PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE and the lithium electrode, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, thereby achieving stable long cycle of the Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//Li cell for more than 8500 h. The Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//LFP cell demonstrated excellent cycle life exceeding 1400 cycles. This study proposes a promising SPEs performance&#8208;enhancing solution, advancing cutting&#8208;edge lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A member of a new family of glycopeptides, named saarvienin A, was isolated from a rare actinomycete Amycolatopsis sp. YIM10. Extensive NMR and MS analyses revealed a halogenated peptide core comprising four amino acids cyclized via a ureido linkage with an exocyclic 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)propyl residue connected to a five&#8208;sugar/aminosugar chain. Two of the three aminosugars constitute the N&#8208;methylated and N,O&#8208;dimethylated derivatives of eremosamine (4&#8208;epi&#8208;vancosamine) that have not been reported in any natural product. Saarvienin A exhibits potent activity against a range of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, effectively overcoming vancomycin and daptomycin resistance in clinical isolates. It demonstrates an eight&#8208;fold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against methicillin&#8208;resistant, vancomycin&#8208;intermediate, and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus compared to vancomycin.</dc:description>

         <title>Temporary Structural Supports for Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The range of functional proteins that can be prepared by chemical protein synthesis includes those bearing complex modifications and incorporating D&#8208;amino acids, and exceeds what can be accessed by biological means, but the technique is still limited by the unfavorable solution behavior of many synthetic protein intermediates in buffer, leading to inefficient ligation, purification, and in vitro folding. One approach to address this limitation is the use of temporary structural supports &#8212; chemical modifications, usually solubilizing functionalities such as polyamines or carbohydrates &#8212; that are installed on either the backbone or side chains of the synthetic intermediates and removed at a later stage of chemical protein synthesis. The basic processes for introducing and removing such temporary structural supports are reminiscent of the canonical protecting groups ubiquitous in organic chemistry. However, unlike the synthesis of small organic molecules, where solubility is rarely an issue, the purpose of temporary structural supports is to modulate the solution behavior of the synthetic intermediates. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of temporary structural supports for chemical protein synthesis and organize them into three categories: 1) Supports to improve solubility; 2) Supports to assist chemical ligation; and 3) Supports to promote folding.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C with High&#8208;Density Atomically Dispersed Mn Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts as alternatives presents an attractive solution for enhancing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and reducing costly platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. Manganese&#8208;based nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C) is anticipated to exhibit durability due to its weaker Fenton reaction propensity. However, a key obstacle lies in boosting intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and increasing the density of Mn active sites, crucial for practical integration into fuel cell operations. Herein, a three&#8208;step method is developed to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C materials with a rich mesoporous structure as highly effective ORR catalysts. The high Mn loading (3.42 wt%) promotes the generation of Duo&#8208;MnN4 active sites, demonstrating outstanding performance and durability for fuel cells. Specifically, the exceptional performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) reaches 649 mW cm&#8722;2 and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC) achieves 770 mW cm&#8722;2. Notably, the durability of the Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst in PEMFC is reported for the first time, showing only an 18.4 % decay after 30,000 square&#8208;wave cycles. This work provides a unique perspective and a systematic design strategy for building feasible nonprecious metal catalysts with a high active site density, addressing the challenges of inefficiency and performance limitations across various electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

However, a key obstacle lies in boosting intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and increasing the density of Mn active sites, crucial for practical integration into fuel cell operations. Herein, a three-step method is developed to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn-N-C materials with a rich mesoporous structure as highly effective ORR catalysts. The high Mn loading (3.42 wt%) promotes the generation of Duo-MnN4 active sites, demonstrating outstanding performance and durability for fuel cells. Specifically, the exceptional performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) reaches 649 mW cm&#8722;2 and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC) achieves 770 mW cm&#8722;2. Notably, the durability of the Mn-N-C catalyst in PEMFC is reported for the first time, showing only an 18.4 % decay after 30,000 square-wave cycles. This work provides a unique perspective and a systematic design strategy for building feasible nonprecious metal catalysts with a high active site density, addressing the challenges of inefficiency and performance limitations across various electrocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Hydrogen Bond Mediated Mass Transfer toward Industrial Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid migration of reactive ions across the electrolyte&#8211;catalytic sites interface is crucial in various catalytic processes. Herein, we introduce hydrogen bond to bridge the intrinsic gap at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface, mediating the diffusion of hydroxide ions. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH, wherein the oxygen atom within the oxyanions established hydrogen bond with H2O molecules in the electrolyte. Operando spectroscopy indicated that both water electrolysis activity and hydroxide concentration exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped dependence on the electrostatic potential of functionalized group, which formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalysis. The sulfate&#8208;modified NiCo OOH achieved an ultralow energy consumption of 4.23 kWh m&#8208;3H2 in the industrial electrolyzers, predicting that the electricity consumption can be reduced by 16,000 TWh.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol by Cu4 Clusters with Adjacent Cu Single Atoms Anchored on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3CH2OH conversion comprising atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu4) and single Cu sites coordinated with 2N and O anchored on two&#8208;step calcinated C3N4 (Cu4/Cu1@CN) is reported. It was found to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to ethanol with production rate of 154 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98%, the yield rate and selectivity exceed most of the reported results for ethanol production. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that the high efficiency of this catalyst arises from the strong synergy beween Cu4 clusters and adjacent Cu single atoms, which facilitates OC&#8722;CO coupling and promotes ethanol production.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights to Cation Effects in Electrolytes for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional understanding of electrocatalytic reactions has primarily focused on the covalent interactions between adsorbates and catalyst surfaces, often overlooking the significant influence of the electrolyte on the catalytic process. Recently, researchers have highlighted the pivotal role of cations in the electrolyte, demonstrating their capability to modulate the reaction pathways and thus the activity and selectivity. These findings underscore the need for a deeper, atomic&#8208;level understanding of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This perspective presents the mechanisms through which cations affect electrocatalysis, with a focus on the hydrogen&#8208;bond network, the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, the electric field within the electrochemical double layer, and the local electronic properties of catalysts. It provides a summary of the influences of cations on various electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, future research directions are provided to maximize the potential of leveraging the cation effects in the design of more efficient electrolyte systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;organization of unordered molecules into ordered, spatiotemporal patterns of complex structures through non&#8208;equilibrium reaction&#8211;diffusion (RD) processes is ubiquitous in nature across all scales. Unlike most RD processes that typically lead to transient patterns, periodic precipitation reactions governed by the Liesegang phenomenon are distinguished by the formation of stable, permanent structures. This unique characteristic makes them valuable tools in the development of hierarchical multifunctional materials, an area that has seen significant progress in recent decades. This review summarizes the fundamental aspects of the Liesegang precipitation phenomenon, focusing on the key characteristics, compositional features, inherent properties, and formation mechanisms of Liesegang patterns in chemical systems, while also highlighting their occurrence in biological and geological settings. We discuss recent advancements in applying periodic precipitation to address global challenges in microelectronics and environmental monitoring, concluding with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the promising future applications of the Liesegang phenomenon in materials science, nanotechnology, medicine, and environmental engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Dendrimer Nanogels for DNA Delivery and Gene Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solving the dilemma between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors is one of the biggest challenges in gene delivery. Cationic dendrimer assemblies with hierarchical structure, smart and biomimetic behaviors have been developed for drug/gene delivery in vivo. Here, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels with high yield and purity, tunable size, uniform morphology, and good colloidal stability were synthesized using the emulsion&#8208;free method, which cannot be obtained by the miniemulsion method. Importantly, the dendrimer nanogels integrate the advantages of low&#8208;generation dendrimer and stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer, thus achieving dual&#8208;active groups, o&#8208;hydroxyl amine units, temperature&#8208;responsiveness, polyampholyte property, and self&#8208;triggered aminolysis. With these unique properties, dendrimer nanogels can &#8220;temporarily&#8221; acquire high charge density through the covalent crosslinking of low&#8208;generation dendrimer for improved DNA compression, promoted cell internalization and lysosomal escape, and efficient DNA delivery, followed by self&#8208;triggered aminolysis in to small dendrimers to control DNA release, reduce cytotoxicity, and facilitate metabolism in vivo. Compared to high&#8208;generation dendrimers, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels display higher gene transfection and therapeutic efficacies, and lower side effects simultaneously. This work provides a facile strategy for the preparation of low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels that break up the contradiction between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors in gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixing and Matching of Hybrid Megasynthases is a Hub for the Evolution of Metabolic Diversity in Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modular megasynthases, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), are molecular assembly lines that biosynthesize many pharmaceutically and ecologically important natural products. Understanding how these compounds evolve could inspire the artificial evolution of compound diversity by metabolic engineering. Over the past two decades, a number of seminal studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of natural product evolution. However, the evolution of NRPS and PKS assembly lines remains poorly understood, especially for NRPS/PKS hybrids. Here, we provide substantial evidence for a remarkable cluster&#8208;mixing event involving three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters, resulting in the emergence of novel peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids that were named minutumamides. By combining retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis with structure&#8208;guided genome mining we could discover a potential evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis. In addition, we were able to trace nostopeptolide&#8208;related module and domain blocks in various other biosynthetic pathways indicating a surprisingly vivid mixing and matching of biosynthesis genes in the evolution of NRPS and cis&#8208;acyltransferase PKS/NRPS pathways, which was previously regarded as a unique feature of trans&#8208;acyltransferase PKS. These remarkable insights into the evolutionary plasticity of NRPS&#8208;PKS assembly lines provide valuable guidance for pathway engineers looking for productive combinations that yield "non&#8208;natural" hybrid natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrogenation of CO2 using Cationic Cu Atomically Dispersed on 2D &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous development of novel catalytic approaches is crucial for advancing efficient CO2 hydrogenation processes. Drawing inspiration from single&#8208;atom catalysis and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, we designed a new 2D single&#8208;atom catalyst with excellent thermal stability by thermally treating Cu&#8208;adsorbed &#947;&#8208;AlOOH nanosheets, which yielded a Cu/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst with high activity in the hydrogenation of CO2 yielding methanol (CH3OH), dimethyl ether (DME), and CO as products. The active Cu sites are monodispersed and highly stable, due to their cationic oxidation state and their substitution for penta&#8208;coordinated aluminum (AlP) sites on particle surfaces.&#160; This study demonstrates an efficient approach for achieving a high CO2 hydrogenation rate (30.45 mol/mol/h) using a catalyst system that lacks metallic Cu centers, traditionally considered essential for H&#8322; dissociation, and employs what was previously thought to be an inert metal oxide (&#947;&#8208;Al2O3) for CO and CH3OH production. Ongoing mechanistic studies aim to elucidate the synergy between cationic Cu single atoms and &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, a Lewis acid support, in facilitating hydrogen (H2) activation and methanol formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Chiral Bisphosphine Ligands with a Terminal Olefin Enables Asymmetric Orthogonal Auto&#8208;Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (ATC) leverages the multiple roles of the catalyst, facilitating the direct synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials in a highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner. However, in conventional ATC, employing a single catalyst imposes significant limitations on the variety of catalyzed reactions. Herein, we present a novel catalysis strategy termed "orthogonal auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (OATC)", which provides the unique opportunity to develop more efficient chemical transformations that cannot be achieved with existing catalytic modes. An unprecedented tandem annulation process involving four different catalytic cycles via asymmetric OATC is demonstrated. The enantiodetermining step is a previously unrealized Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic lactonization. The key to the whole success lies in the development of a new class of chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos) that addressed not only the racemization issue of allylic ester products in classic &#960;&#8208;allylmetal chemistry, but also the inherent compatibility challenges in transition&#8208;metal/organo dual catalytic system. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the vital role of the terminal olefin in TOPhos, enabling the differentiation of competitive enantioselective pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Alkenylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine and Naphthalene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>External tuning of enamine intermediate has significantly expanded reaction space of typical aminocatalysis. Notwithstanding the progress of chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;oxidation of enamine intermediate, electro&#8208;oxidation was left as a much less explored area, in stark contrast to the prosperous renaissance of electrochemistry in recent years. Challenges mainly come from the reactivity barrier as a consequence of heterogeneous electron transfer, and subtle stereo&#8208;control in ionic electrolyte solution under the influence of electric field. Herein, we report asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of carbonyl compounds using potassium alkenyl trifluoroborate as a model reaction to demonstrate the capability of primary amine catalysis under electrochemical conditions. By employing enamine redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) strategy, a new organic mediator, dimethoxyl naphthalene, was found to greatly enhance reactivity. Mechanistic studies uncover an ion&#8208;pair interaction between protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate that account for the exceptional enantioselectivity. This catalytic system demonstrates the best level of enantioselectivities in electro&#8208;oxidative enamine transformations so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Iron&#8208;Aluminium Reactivity for Dinitrogen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel bimetallic approach utilizing cooperative Fe&#8208;Al reactivity for N2 activation on the Cp*Fe(1,2&#8208;Cy2PC6H4AlEt) platform, effectively capturing two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#8208;N&#8801;N&#8208;Al coordination. Characterizations of the N2&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;Al dimer (2) using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveals its electronic structure as a resonance hybrid between Fe(+2)&#8208;Al(+1) and Fe(0)&#8208;Al(+3). The flexible, covalent Fe&#8208;Al bonding facilitates the subsequent alkylation of the Al site with nBuLi, leading to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex (3) that enables the silylation of the terminal N atom. Our findings highlight the significance of leveraging Fe&#8208;Al effects as an electron buffer to achieve facile N2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Ultrathin MOL/MOL S&#8208;Scheme Heterostructures Toward Boosted&#160;Photocatalytic Charge Kinetics for Efficient H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic efficiencies highly depend on the kinetic behaviors of photogenerated electrons in catalysts. Herein, based on the promising metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), we design and build an advantageous architecture of ultrathin MOF&#8208;layer (MOL) heterojunctions by a facile pH&#8208;adjusted electrostatic assembling of pre&#8208;exfoliated porphyrinic and pyrene&#8208;based MOLs. Such an architecture constitutes an S&#8208;scheme junction to drive interfacial charge separation, features ultrathin structures to shorten charge transfer distances, and maximizes accessible metal sites to facilitate terminal charge reaction, thoroughly promoting the charge kinetics in materials. The resulting MOL/MOL composites perform a significantly enhanced catalytic activity for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution, 8.5 and 106 times that of individual MOLs. Further fine&#8208;tuning into more reactive metal nodes achieves an optimal H2 production (2027 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1) with a high apparent quantum yield of 2.75% without additional cocatalysts, ranking among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activities from all&#8208;MOF photocatalysts. This work demonstrates an accessible and universal methodology to realize a superior ultrathin MOL/MOL heterojunction architecture toward accelerated charge kinetics, providing valuable insights for the development of efficient photocatalyst systems for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Recognition of a DNA Four&#8208;Way Junction by an M2L4 Metallo&#8208;cage, Inspired by a Simulation&#8208;Guided Design Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) play an important biological role in DNA repair and recombination, and viral regulation, and are attractive therapeutic targets. Compounds that recognise the junction structure are rare; in this work, we describe cationic metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages as a new type of 4WJ binder with nanomolar affinities. A combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments show that the size and shape of a compound comprising square planar Pd or Pt and anthracene&#8208;based ligands is an excellent fit for the 4WJ cavity. Whilst the cage is also capable of binding to three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) and Y&#8208;fork structures, we show that the 4WJ is the preferred DNA target, and that duplex B&#8208;DNA is not a competitor. Among 3WJs, T&#8208;shape bulged 3WJs are bound more preferably than perfect Y&#8208;shaped 3WJs. Whilst previous work studying M2L4 metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages has focused on binding inside their structures, this work exploits the external aromatic surfaces of the supramolecule, creating a supramolecular guest that ideally matches the DNA host cavity. This approach allows available structures to be identified as potential junction binders and then screened for their fit to a nucleic acid junction target using simulations. This has potential to significantly accelerate discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Tunnel TaOx Passivating Interlayer Enables Long&#8208;term Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;based photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells offer significant advantages for solar&#8208;to&#8208;clean fuel conversion but face challenges such as surface recombination and poor stability, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of device failure mechanisms and effective mitigation strategies. Using nickel decorated n&#8208;type silicon (n&#8208;Si/Ni) as a model photoelectrode, we demonstrate that surface restructuring during operation initially passivates surface recombination but eventually blocks photogenerated hole transfer, leading to device failure. To mitigate this challenge, an ultrathin (&lt;1 nm) tantalum oxide (TaOx) interlayer is introduced via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This TaOx layer serves as both a passivating contact and a corrosion&#8208;resistant coating. The n&#8208;Si/TaOx/Ni electrode achieves an increased photovoltage from 150 mV to 500 mV and significantly extends the device lifespan, maintaining over 90% performance for 500 h in 1 M KOH at 1.52 V versus RHE. These results highlight the implementation of amorphous TaOx in enhancing both the efficiency and durability of silicon&#8208;based PEC systems, providing a simultaneously passivating and protection strategy for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies under harsh conditions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Silicon-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells offer significant advantages for solar-to-clean fuel conversion but face challenges such as surface recombination and poor stability, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of device failure mechanisms and effective mitigation strategies. Using nickel decorated n-type silicon (n-Si/Ni) as a model photoelectrode, we demonstrate that surface restructuring during operation initially passivates surface recombination but eventually blocks photogenerated hole transfer, leading to device failure.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Networks Mediated by Redox&#8208;Responsive Neighboring&#8208;Group&#8208;Participating Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) typically require external catalysts to facilitate efficient crosslinker exchange, which can limit the reprocessability of the network due to leaching and degradation of the catalyst. In this study, the use of catalysts was avoided by employing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (BCN) bis&#8208;alkyl halide crosslinker with selenium&#8208;based neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) to enhance the rate of bond exchange. This thermally mediated C&#8208;N alkyl exchange and the associated flow behavior enabled the intrinsically ionic network (which possesses antimicrobial properties) to be both chemically recycled and repaired and reprocessed under mild conditions. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of the network can be regulated by the reversible redox responsiveness of selenium atoms within the network. This novel type of NGP&#8208;based CAN therefore has potential to enrich designs for catalyst&#8208;free dynamic networks with high performance and modulated dynamicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionated Perylenebisimides as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers: Intersystem Crossing, Electron Spin Dynamics and Application in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thionation induced intersystem crossing (ISC) in perylenebisimide (PBI) derivatives was studied. The triplet state lifetimes of the thionated PBIs are substantially shortened (0.12 &#956;s &#8722; 0.78 &#956;s) as compared to the unsubstituted PBI (ca. 130 &#956;s). Moreover, there is a clear trend of shortening of the triplet excited state lifetimes and the degree of thionation of the carbonyl groups in PBI. These findings rationalize the previous report of&#160;&#160;the contradictory&#160;lower 1O2 quantum yields for the PBI derivatives with more carbonyl groups thionated. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectral study shows that the zero field splitting parameters D (1625 &#8722; 1992 MHz) of the lowest triplet states of thionated PBI are larger than that of the pristine PBI chromophore (D = 1166 MHz), which is attributed to the influence of sulfur atoms. Interestingly, the electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of the TREPR spectra is inverted at longer delay time. Importantly we observed ISC for the dianion of the thionated PBI derivatives, and photoexcited dianion species can be used as super strong reductant for photocatalysis with the advantage of long excited state lifetimes (18~85 &#956;s), and the excited state oxidation potentials are &#8722;1.47 ~ &#8722;1.77&#160;V (vs. Fc/Fc+).</dc:description>

         <title>Spatio&#8208;chemical and spatio&#8208;temporal processes of hierarchical multicompartments: Diffusion&#8208;controlled communication between nano&#8208; and microcompartments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Exploring the synergy of feedback behavior and molecular communication between micro&#8208; and nanocompartments is of great implication for the development of advanced hierarchical living&#8208;like materials. Non&#8208;covalent interactions are the driving forces for dynamic and temporal events in biomimetic structures. Herein, pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical multicompartments (HMC) are constructed via hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions between azobenzene units and phospholipid layers through the integration of two distinct structural units: phospholipid&#8208;membranized coacervates (Coa@DMPC) and azobenzene&#8208;functionalized polymersomes (Azo&#8208;Psomes). This enables to study spatio&#8208;temporal signal pathways for biomimetic pH homeostasis and the triggering of feedback&#8208;controlled peroxidase&#8208;like behavior of Azo&#8208;Psomes within HMC. Compared with undocking systems, the information transmission process within HMC shows a high efficiency. Besides the continuous addition of nutrients, the synchronization of two different biomimetic reactions in HMC requires the spatial loading of glucose oxidase and L&#8208;phenylalanine ammonia lyase in coacervates and of L&#8208;phenylalanine or beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Azo&#8208;Psomes exhibit pH&#8208;responsive feedback&#8208;controlled behavior. The pH&#8208;responsive membrane of Azo&#8208;Psomes is responsible for the spatio&#8208;temporal peroxidase&#8208;like activity of lumen&#8208;integrated beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Finally, this strategy provides a new approach to constructing more complex biomimetic systems by interconnecting at least two membrane&#8208;containing compartments to further explore the synergistic mechanisms and feedback behaviors among artificial cell communities.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of polarized N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) based on an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine scaffold is presented. In contrast to regular NHOs the unique bicyclic heterocyclic core allows the incorporation of various substituents in close proximity to the highly polarized exocyclic C&#8211;C bond. The donor properties of the new carbon&#8208;based ligand class were quantified and the coordination chemistry explored. Alkenyl or alkynyl groups at the C5&#8208;position lead to spontaneous cyclization to yield imidazo[2,1,5&#8208;de]quinolizines. The unique cyclization strategy was compatible with a wide range of substitution patterns and yields highly electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;delocalized heterocycles. The electronic structure of the novel partially antiaromatic heterocycle was thoroughly investigated. One&#8208;electron oxidation occurs at low potentials and lead to a stable monomeric radical&#8208;cation confirmed by XRD, which showed solution phase fluorescence expanding into the field of open&#8208;shell organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208;Promoted Decomposition of Cysteine&#160;Ester (ITPDC): A General&#160;Platform&#160;for Controllable Release of Reactive Sulfur Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endogenously generated&#160;reactive sulfur species&#160;(RSS) play critical roles in various physiological processes. RSS donors can enhance our understanding of RSS chemical biology and open new avenues for treatmenting&#160;RSS&#8208;associated diseases. Nevertheless, general strategies&#160;for the controllable release of distinct RSS remain&#160;lacking. Herein, we present the first general platform for&#160;controllable release of RSS&#160;with oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4, based on the&#160;intramolecular thiol&#8208;promoted decomposition of cysteine ester (ITPDC). We first rationally&#160;designed ITPDC&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#160;donors&#160;that avoid&#160;electrophilic byproducts&#160;and exhibit high H2S&#160;release efficiencies (&gt;50%). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory&#160;calculations elucidated&#160;the detailed&#160;pathways of&#160;pH&#8208;controllable&#160;H2S&#160;release from ITPDC, and computational studies also&#160;predicted&#160;other H2S&#8208;related RSS release from&#160;the&#160;ITPDC&#8208;based motifs. Importantly, we&#160;developed a series of ITPDC&#8208;based donors&#160;capable of releasing various RSS, including persulfide, hydrogen persulfide, sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Moreover, fluorescent imaging demonstrated the successful cellular delivery of H2S, persulfide, and SO2&#160;from these donors, and the ITPDC&#8208;based&#160;motif was&#160;employed to create a light&#8208;triggered donor.&#160;We anticipate that these&#160;innovative chemistries will provide valuable tools for studying sulfur biology and for developing new RSS donors and&#160;bio&#8208;orthogonal cleavage techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>An Engineered Biocatalyst for Enantioselective Hydrazone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective reduction of hydrazones provides a convergent and versatile route to synthesize hydrazine&#8208;containing motifs that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However current methods require the use of precious metals, costly chiral ligands and/or forcing reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a biocatalytic approach for enantioselective hydrazone reduction using engineered imine reductases. Following evaluation of an in&#8208;house panel of &gt;400 IRED sequences, we identified a single IR361 I127F L179V variant that promotes reduction of Cbz&#8208;protected hydrazones. Introduction of an additional two mutations via directed evolution afforded HRED1.1 that is 20&#8208;fold more active than the parent template and promotes reduction of a variety of protected hydrazones in high yields and selectivities (&gt;99% e.e.), including in preparative scale biotransformations. Structural analysis of HRED1.1 provides insights into the origins of its unique hydrazone reductase activity. This study offers a powerful biocatalytic route to synthesize valuable chiral hydrazine products and further expands the impressive range of transformations accessible with engineered imine reductases.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Complexity of Divalent Hydride Electrolytes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries via a Data&#8208;Driven Framework with Large Language Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are essential for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, the exploration of divalent hydrides is hindered by complex ionic migration mechanisms and reliance on &#8220;trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8221; methodologies. Conventional approaches, which focus on individual materials and predefined pathways, remain inefficient. Herein, we present a data&#8208;driven artificial intelligence framework that integrates a comprehensive SSE database with large language models and ab initio metadynamics (MetaD) simulations to accelerate the discovery of hydride SSEs. Our study reveals that hydrides incorporating neutral molecules have great potential, with MetaD revealing novel &#8220;two&#8208;step&#8221; ion migration mechanisms. Predictive models developed using both experimental and computational data accurately forecast ionic migration activation energies for various types of hydride SSEs. In particular, some SSEs with carbon&#8208;containing neutral molecules exhibit notably low activation energy, with barriers as low as 0.62 eV. This framework enables the rapid identification of optimized SSE candidates and establishes a transformative tool for advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Uni&#8208;Electrolyte: An Artificial Intelligence Platform for Designing Electrolyte Molecules for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes are an essential part of rechargeable batteries such as lithium batteries. However, electrolyte innovation is facing grand challenges due to the complicated solution chemistry and infinite molecular space (&gt;1060 for small molecules). This work reported an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, namely Uni&#8208;Electrolyte, for designing advanced electrolyte molecules, which mainly includes three parts, i.e., EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor. New molecules can be designed by combining high&#8208;throughput screening and generative AI models from more than 100 million alternative molecules in the EMolCurator module. The molecule properties including frontier molecular orbital information, formation energy, binding energy with a Li ion, viscosity, and dielectric constant, can be adopted as the screening parameters. The EMolForger and EMolNetKnittor modules can predict the retrosynthesis pathway and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation mechanism for a given molecule, respectively. With the assistance of advanced AI methods, the Uni&#8208;Electrolyte is strongly supposed to discover new electrolyte molecules and chemical principles, promoting the practical application of next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Affinity Molecular Recognition in Water and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous&#8208;phase molecular recognition pairs with ultrahigh binding affinity hold immense value in biotechnology and chemical applications. However, the rational design of synthetic pairs with such exceptional binding strength has long remained a significant challenge, with notable progress achieved only in recent years. In this Minireview, we begin by defining the term &#8220;ultrahigh&#8208;affinity&#8221; through a comprehensive analysis of available data on aqueous&#8208;phase molecular recognition by water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic hosts. Based on&#160;this foundation, we provide a detailed overview of the latest advancements in various classes of ultrahigh&#8208;affinity receptors, extracting key design principles that drive their remarkable performance. We further highlight emerging applications of ultrahigh&#8208;affinity molecular pairs in biomedical materials, spanning bioorthogonal chemistry, biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery, and toxin sequestration. These examples underscore the transformative potential of ultrahigh&#8208;affinity recognition in addressing real&#8208;world biomedical challenges. Finally, we offer a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the future of this rapidly evolving field, exploring potential directions for designing more diverse and functional ultrahigh&#8208;affinity molecular recognition tools. By bridging the gap between fundamental science and practical applications, this Minireview aims to inspire the development of next&#8208;generation molecular recognition systems and foster deeper integration between supramolecular chemistry and biomedical materials, paving the way for innovative solutions to pressing biomedical needs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed direct addition of (hetero)aryl C&#8722;H bond to an alkene provides an expedited route to construct benzylic stereocenter from readily available arene and alkene feedstocks with complete atom&#8208;economy. However, creation of more than one stereocenter through enantioselective C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation remains a challenging goal. Here we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydroheteroarylation of cyclopentenes to construct 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. A series of heteroaryl C&#8722;H bonds were cleaved site&#8208;selectively and added regio&#8208; and enantioselectively to an unactivated alkene containing an amide coordinating group, delivering valuable enantioenriched cyclopentane scaffolds containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8208;tertiary or 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8208;tertiary stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Halide Manipulation for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine&#8208;rich inorganic perovskites possessing desirable bandgaps as well as high thermal and chemical stability are facing serious issues of low polymorphic stability, while chlorine&#8208;rich inorganic perovskites hold outstanding thermodynamic stability but suffer from low efficiency. Here, we develop function&#8208;gradient inorganic perovskites adopting a surface halide substitution strategy, where a stable chlorine&#8208;rich skin protects efficient iodine&#8208;rich layers, incorporating high stability of chlorine&#8208;rich perovskites with high efficiency of iodine&#8208;rich perovskites. This strategy simultaneously passivates surface defects and stabilizes the photoactive polymorphs of perovskite, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 21.2% for unit cells (0.16 cm2) and 19.2% for solar modules (23.9 cm2). Notably, the compositional gradient mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and enhances resistance to environmental erosion. Thus, our devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1000&#8208;hour storage in air and 3200&#8208;hour operation under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at 40 &#176;C, representing the most stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks at the Edge of Stability: Mediating Node Distortion to Access Metastable Nanoparticle Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as unconventional precursors for nanoparticle synthesis, with potential to leverage their tunable structures and chemistry to achieve nanomaterials with structures and compositions inaccessible via traditional synthetic routes. Here we use in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) measurements to investigate how the dynamic structure of MOFs at the edge of stability influences their transformation into different metastable polymorphs.

Focusing on the titanium&#8208;based MOF MIL&#8208;125, we demonstrate that manipulating the chemical environment to facilitate transformation of the Ti8 node geometry promotes formation of metastable, nanometer&#8208;scale TiO2 brookite rather than the more common anatase and rutile TiO2 polymorphs typically produced through MOF pyrolysis at high temperature. These findings highlight the potential to harness the MOF topology and chemical environment to design and control node distortions and enable access to exotic metastable nanoparticle states.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Induced Transformation of Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Large Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural transformation of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters is of significant interest, because of its relevance to the formation mechanisms and stability of metal clusters. Herein, we report three large homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2, synthesized from the same precursor 2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;CAg via fine&#8208;tuning the reduction rate. X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrates that Ino decahedral Ag13 units serve as building blocks in all three nanoclusters. Remarkably,  Ag98  undergoes an intercluster transformation in methanol. It initially converts into  Ag74 , thenAg74reacts withAg98to formAg86, which eventually is transformed into the thermodynamically stableAg74. Time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) confirms such a multi&#8208;step reaction process during the transformation, identifyingAg86as the key intermediate. Our findings not only provide new insights into the structural transformation pathways of nanoclusters, but also enhance the understanding of transformation mechanisms, contributing to the rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchically Self&#8208;Assembled Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Gels for Guest Segregation and Electrical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for macroscopic materials with differentially addressable spaces based on molecular containers has long been driven by their great potential for diverse practical applications pertaining guest selective capture and release. Herein, we report a class of gels (G1&#8208;NH2, G1&#8208;UPy, G2&#8208;NH2, and G2&#8208;UPy) that are formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of anion&#8208;coordinated architectures. The well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of the cavities within anion&#8208;coordinated architectures endow the gels with different internal phases, which is beneficial to differentiate the release profiles of guest molecules (dimethylethanolamine, choline, and propyl trimethylammonium) depending on their binding affinity. This study also introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real&#8208;time via electrical characterization. This work may thus provide a useful strategy for selective solid&#8208;phase molecular separation.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Studies of Multi&#8208;Carrier Dynamics in Electrochemically&#8208;charged Colloidal CdSe/CdS Core/Shell Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) in optoelectronic devices and photocatalysis inevitably involves them in charged states. The carrier and exciton dynamics of electrochemically charged NCs in solutions have yet to be reported. Herein, the electrochemical charging effects in colloidal CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) are systematically investigated using static spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) and in situ transient absorption spectroscopy. Static SEC reveals the presence of in&#8208;gap trap states from 0.9 eV below the conduction band edge. Negligible changes of transient absorption spectra and kinetics were observed from OCP to more anodic potentials within the QD band gap. At cathodic potentials, the negatively charged QDs show band edge trion decay with a lifetime of 690 &#177; 31 ps, and slower 1P to 1S electron relaxation with time constants of 12.4 &#177; 0.8 ps assigned to the spin blockade effect and 316 &#177; 35 ps assigned to phonon bottleneck effect. Our study reveals rich effects of charging on QD excited state under nearly native conditions</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Schiff Base Complexes for Chemiluminogenic Bioprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes were found to display enchanting chemiluminescence upon reaction with reactive oxygen species. The unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion was responsible for the unexpected chemiluminescence. Nanoparticles derived from chemiluminogenic iridium(III) Schiff base complexes were successfully employed as chemiluminescence imaging probes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Chemiluminogenic bioimaging has emerged as a promising paradigm due to its independence from light excitation, thereby circumventing challenges related to light penetration depth and background autofluorescence. However, the availability of effective chemiluminophores remains limited, which substantially impedes their bio&#8208;applications. Herein, we discovered for the first time that cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes can unexpectedly generate chemiluminescence. Notably, the chemiluminescence reaction was rapid, with a half&#8208;life of only 0.86&#8197;s, significantly faster than previously reported examples. Unlike conventional chemiluminescent scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of the chemiluminogenic iridium(III) complex is its unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion upon reaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, the chemiluminogenicity of these complexes is not influenced by the cyclometalating ligands but is closely associated with the Schiff base ligand, allowing for tuning of the emission colors via altering the cyclometalating ligands. Additionally, we formulated one of the Schiff base complexes (1) as water&#8208;soluble chemiluminogenic nanoparticles (CLNPs) and successfully employed them as activatable chemiluminescence bioprobes for precise and rapid imaging of hypochlorite&#8208;related biological events both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We believe that this significant finding of the development of chemiluminogenic Schiff base complexes will greatly facilitate the designing of innovative chemiluminophores for theranostic applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nondirected and Regioselective Arylation of Internal Alkenes with Simple Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective insertion of (hetero) aryl groups into the C&#8722;C double bond of unactivated internal alkenes by nondirected arene&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H activation has been achieved. The design and development of a new ligand&#8208;supported palladium catalysis, enables quick access to trisubstituted alkenes, especially E&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylalkenes, from unfunctionalized simple raw materials in moderate to high yields, with excellent regio&#8208; and stereocontrol.







Abstract
Regioselective functionalization of internal alkenes has become a highly efficient approach for preparing stereochemically defined multi&#8208;substituted olefins. Unlike traditional methods that require directing groups, activating groups, or active chemical bonds (e.g., halide, pseudo halide, organometallic reagent, etc.), there remains a strong demand for nondirected and selective functionalization of unactivated alkenes with simple coupling partners, both in academic research or industrial applications. Herein, we report the development of a pyridone&#8208;oxazoline (Pyoox) type ligand that combines the features of both pyridone and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline in assisting Pd&#8208;catalyzed olefination. This ligand enables the activation of simple (hetero) arenes and internal alkenes within a single reaction system. A nondirected and regioselective arylation from simple raw materials has been achieved, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted olefins in moderate to excellent yields, with excellent regio&#8208;/stereocontrol. Experimental and computational studies on mechanisms offer insight into the distinctive properties and performance of this ligand&#8208;promoted catalysis. The synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the simplified synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Conformal Reconstruction and Dual&#8208;Vacancy Engineering Breaks Kinetics Limitations for Energetic Aqueous Dual&#8208;Cation Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By refining the local proton environment, we have realized precise manipulation of in situ reconstruction to yield dual vacancies and three&#8208;dimensional diffusion channels. The tailored dual vacancies favor the adsorption of charge carriers and ensure conformal reconstruction, at the same time, the residual Al presents the pining effect to suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, resulting in stable and energetic dual&#8208;cation storage.







Abstract
Efficient aqueous energy storage with non&#8208;metallic ions is highly desired but challenged by achieving kinetically favorable surface/interface storage chemistry. Herein, by refining the surface proton environment, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with hydrogen&#8208;aluminum dual vacancies and 3D diffusion channels are demonstrated upon conformal surface reconstruction. An energetic NH4+/H+ dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry is enabled, leading to a remarkable gravimetric specific capacity of up to 604&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;cycle stability. Combining in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we reveal and visualize the conformal reconstruction process and the reversible dual&#8208;cation storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the dual&#8208;vacancy coupling helps the dissolution of inert Al from LDHs for enriching active sites. At the same time, the residual Al shows the pining effect on the [MnO6] octahedron to restrain the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The manganese sites adjacent to Al vacancies promote the adsorption of NH4+/H+ and the H vacancies facilitate the adsorption of NH4+, responsible for an optimal dual&#8208;cation storage chemistry. This work demonstrates how the dual vacancies emerge to modulate the carrier migration and thereby the capacity, providing a viable solution of surface/interface optimization for efficient aqueous energy storage.

         <title>Mitigating Diffusion&#8208;Induced Intragranular Cracking in Single&#8208;Crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 via Extended Solid&#8208;Solution Behavior</title>

This study outlines a design strategy to enhance the mechanical integrity of single&#8208;crystal LNMO cathodes by extending solid&#8208;solution behavior. Combined experimental and modeling approaches identify stress distribution within the crystal and demonstrate the role of Mg doping in mitigating intragranular cracking.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal cathodes have been investigated for their inherent resistance to intergranular cracking due to the absence of grain boundaries. However, these materials exhibit significant intragranular cracking, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of extended solid&#8208;solution reactions on mitigating crack formation in magnesium&#8208;doped single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (Mg&#8208;SC&#8208;LNMO) cathodes. With Mg acting as a structural pillar, the overall volume change was reduced by nearly 50&#8201;%, the two&#8208;phase reaction was effectively suppressed, and the Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficient was doubled. Continuum modeling based on experimental observations demonstrates that Mg doping significantly reduces the internal stress induced by lithium diffusion, thereby preserving the mechanical integrity of single&#8208;crystal LNMO. This improvement leads to enhanced electrochemical performance and durability. Our study provides new insights into mechanically robust single&#8208;crystal cathodes and proposes a design strategy to improve the durability of next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Metastable Oxygen Redox Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;free Li0.693[Li0.153Ni0.190Mn0.657]O2 (LLNMO) exhibits outstanding electrochemistry by harnessing both cation and anion redox activities. It features a metastable structure with both edge&#8208;sharing (E) and face&#8208;sharing (F) local geometries, distinct from conventional O3&#8208;type structures. The face&#8208;sharing local configuration provides enhanced stability and flexibility to modulate the interlayer interactions during de&#8208;/lithiation.







Abstract
Simultaneously harnessing cation and anion redox activities in the cathode is crucial for the development of high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, achieving long&#8208;term stability for both mechanisms remains a significant challenge due to pronounced anisotropic volume changes at low lithium content, unfavorable cation migration, and oxygen loss. Here, we demonstrate exceptionally stable cation and anion redox behavior in a metastable, cobalt&#8208;free layered oxide, Li0.693[Li0.153Ni0.190Mn0.657]O2 (LLNMO). After 50&#8197;cycles at 50&#8197;mA/g (~0.2&#8197;C), the cathode retains 97.4&#8201;% of its initial capacity (222.4&#8197;mAh/g) with negligible voltage decay. This remarkable stability is attributed to its metastable O6&#8208;type structure (R&#8208;3m symmetry) with unique local geometry. The face&#8208;sharing connectivity between lithium layers and alternating transition metal (TM) layers effectively suppresses TM migration&#8208;induced voltage decay during anion redox. Additionally, the structure balances interlayer cation/cation and anion/anion repulsions, resulting in minimal expansion and contraction during de&#8208;/lithiation (&lt;2.3&#8201;% along the c&#8208;axis) and excellent structural reversibility. These findings highlight that layered oxides with a metastable framework are promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Urea Complete Conversion to Compound Fertilizer in Industrial&#8208;Scale Tandem Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An industrial&#8208;grade tandem system was developed to fully convert urea (or urea wastewater) into compound fertilizer while generating H2. In a typical cycle, 200&#8197;g of urea was used to produce 232&#8197;L of pure H2 and 1580&#8197;g of solid compound fertilizer (KH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4) without further separation. The core is to develop an electrocatalyst (S&#8208;NiOOH&#8208;Ni(OH)2) with exceptional activity for urea oxidation.







Abstract
A compound fertilizer with NH4H2PO4 and KH2PO4 offer significant advantages in enhancing both crop yield and quality. Ammonia (NH3) is essential for the synthesis of the compound fertilizer, which was produced by an energy intensive chemical process. Developing efficient and environmental friendly methods to produce ammonia&#8208;containing compound fertilizers is crucial and extremely challenging. Here, we present a tandem catalysis system capable of achieving complete conversion of abundant urea into compound fertilizer in industrial&#8208;scale reactors by combining electrochemical and subsequent chemical processes. In a typical cycle, with the use of 200&#8197;g urea, 1580&#8197;g of solid compound fertilizer (KH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4) and 232&#8197;L of pure H2 are produced without any further separation process. The key to the realization of this system is to precisely control the rate of urea consumption and NO2&#8722; formation in electrochemical process. By maintaining a precise molar concentration ratio of urea to NO2&#8722; at 1/2 in electrolyte, urea can completely react with NO2&#8722; to form N2, while CNO&#8722; can be converted into NH4+ to form compound fertilizer in the second step of H3PO4 treatment, achieving complete conversion of urea without by&#8208;products formation. This method remarkably reduces H2 production potential while allowing for extraction of ammonia from urea&#8208;containing wastewater or urine to create pure compound fertilizer at an anticipated lower price than that of current market.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while CNO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can be converted into NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form compound fertilizer in the second step of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; treatment, achieving complete conversion of urea without by-products formation. This method remarkably reduces H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production potential while allowing for extraction of ammonia from urea-containing wastewater or urine to create pure compound fertilizer at an anticipated lower price than that of current market.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Density Catalytic Sites Grafting on 2D&#8208;Metal Oxides for Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing 2D&#8208;nanocofined metal atomic&#8208;site grafting strategy, involving the thermal conversion of catalyst precursor loaded single metal hydroxide layer within silica bilayer envelope, produced the high density single atomic catalytic sites stably and homogeneously embedded on isolated 1&#8197;nm&#8208;thin metal oxide nanosheets, which demonstrated outperforming activity in catalyzing acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
Installing well&#8208;defined high density single&#8208;atomic catalyst (SAC) sites is highly desired for the synergistic cooperative effect in efficient chemical synthesis but elusive to synthesize due to unavoidable atomic segregation into clusters or particulates. We implemented a 2D&#8208;nanoconfined SAC grafting strategy. Inside a bilayer silica envelope, single metal hydroxide layer, pre&#8208;loaded with the catalytic metal (Pt, Pd, Ir) precursors, underwent controlled thermal conversion to the homogeneously embedded SACs decorated onto the in&#8197;situ generated 1&#8197;nm&#8208;thin transition metal oxide (TMO) nanosheet. Ultranarrow confined slit&#8208;space exclusively availed laterally emerging cation vacancies of TMO host, as atomic scale sockets to capture SACs within 2D&#8208;plane while vertically restricting the atomic aggregation into nanoparticulates. High density SACs stably decorated on isolated TMO nanosheet, could be obtained in a controllable manner. Well&#8208;defined SACs on TMO were conveniently employed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of a variety of alcohols with quite high activities outperforming reported catalysts. In&#8208;depth, mechanistic investigation revealed the dramatic enhancement in acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction rates by following distinct reaction pathways (concerted or stepwise) depending on the density of SACs cooperativity effect. Such advantageous effect is distinct from the reactions on isolated metal sites in low&#8208;density SACs or nanoparticle surface.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Selectively Activated Aromatic Rings for High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The Co&#8208;NTTA MOF (NTTA=5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings in diverse chemical environments, is synthesized as the high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate Li&#8208;ion battery anode. Both the NTTA ligands and Co cations participate in a 51&#8208;electron reversible redox reaction. The &#8220;structure&#8208;property&#8221; relationship is deeply elucidated, and for the first time, selective activation of different aromatic rings within a single MOF has been revealed.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered promising candidates for anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their designable structure, abundant active sites, and well&#8208;organized porosity. However, the structural factors governing active site utilization and Li&#8208;ion storage kinetics remain inadequately understood. In particular, the Li&#8208;ion storage behaviors of aromatic rings with high LUMO energy levels and situated in varying chemical environments remain a highly debated issue. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;based MOF (Co&#8208;NTTA, NTTA ligand: 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings situated in diverse local environments, is deliberately designed and synthesized. Experimental characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations have verified the occurrence of a reversible electrochemical reaction involving a total of 51 electrons among the NTTA ligands, cobalt cations, and Li+ ions. Unlike the traditional concept of superlithiation, the three inner aromatic rings are selectively activated by &#960;&#8208;aromatic conjugation networks and &#960;

&#960; stacking, contributing to a reversible 6&#8208;electron pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation reaction. Conversely, the three outer aromatic rings remain inert toward Li+ ions. Impressively, the Co&#8208;NTTA MOF anode, with selectively activated aromatic rings, delivers a reversible capacity of up to 956&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates exceptional high&#8208;rate durability, further supporting a 4.3&#8197;V lithium&#8208;ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor with high energy/power density.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Dimethyl Ether from Syngas over Nanoparticle&#8208;Derived Bifunctional Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst that exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability in the single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether reaction. Comprehensive results obtained from HAADF&#8208;STEM, XPS, and in&#8197;situ UHV&#8208;FTIRS demonstrate the formation of highly dispersed Pd clusters/particles confined on a nanoparticulate ceria matrix with interfacial Pd2+ sites, accounting for the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
The single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether (STD) process offers both economic and technical advantages over the current two&#8208;step industrial process that utilizes Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. Here, we report a highly active bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, in which Pd colloids dispersed in a nanoscale CeO2 matrix serve as the key building block for the methanol&#8208;active component, efficiently catalysing the STD reaction. For Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 with a high Pd&#8208;CeO2 interface concentration, CO conversion and dimethyl ether yield are significantly increased compared to Pd supported on Al2O3. Systematic investigations using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques reveal the formation of highly dispersed palladium clusters/particles confined within the nanoparticulate CeO2 matrix. The superior catalytic performance in both activity and stability observed for the Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 in the STD reaction stems from the active cationic palladium interfacial species and the presence of adjacent O vacancies.

         <title>Achieving Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution Phase from Carbon Dots Confined in Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step high&#8208;temperature coprecipitation method is firstly developed to encapsulate citrate&#8208;derived carbon dots into NaYF4 nanocrystals, which protects the triplet excitons of carbon dots from quenching and provides a stable environment for room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in solution phase.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted growing interest in the construction of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. However, in the solution phase of CDs, it is still challenging to obtain efficient and stable phosphorescent emission due to the intense quenching effect by dissolved oxygen and solvent molecules. Herein, we report robust phosphorescence in the solution phase, achieved by encapsulating citrate&#8208;derived CDs into NaYF4 nanocrystals via a one&#8208;step method of high&#8208;temperature coprecipitation. Combined characterizations show that the triplet emission from CDs is related to the abundance of C=O in the CDs, the formation of ionic&#8208;bond networks around the CDs, and the spatial confinement and quenching inhibition effects of NaYF4 nanocrystals. Notably, the transition of CDs@NaYF4 from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity can be easily achieved by simple surface modulation of NaYF4 nanocrystals, which allows the RTP of CDs to be maintained in either polar or nonpolar solvents. In addition, CDs@NaYF4 exhibits stable afterglow in different pH environments, suggesting its excellent stability. Finally, we demonstrated the application of CDs@NaYF4 in 3D printing, oily anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns, and cell imaging. Our work can serve the controllable preparation of solution&#8208;phase RTP materials and their various applications.

&lt;p&gt;A one-step high-temperature coprecipitation method is firstly developed to encapsulate citrate-derived carbon dots into NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals, which protects the triplet excitons of carbon dots from quenching and provides a stable environment for room-temperature phosphorescence in solution phase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted growing interest in the construction of room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. However, in the solution phase of CDs, it is still challenging to obtain efficient and stable phosphorescent emission due to the intense quenching effect by dissolved oxygen and solvent molecules. Herein, we report robust phosphorescence in the solution phase, achieved by encapsulating citrate-derived CDs into NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals via a one-step method of high-temperature coprecipitation. Combined characterizations show that the triplet emission from CDs is related to the abundance of C=O in the CDs, the formation of ionic-bond networks around the CDs, and the spatial confinement and quenching inhibition effects of NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals. Notably, the transition of CDs@NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity can be easily achieved by simple surface modulation of NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals, which allows the RTP of CDs to be maintained in either polar or nonpolar solvents. In addition, CDs@NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits stable afterglow in different pH environments, suggesting its excellent stability. Finally, we demonstrated the application of CDs@NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in 3D printing, oily anti-counterfeiting patterns, and cell imaging. Our work can serve the controllable preparation of solution-phase RTP materials and their various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helically Chiral Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems Comprising N&#8208;Heterotriangulenes: Stabilization of the Cationic Species by &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>

[5]Helicene&#8208;bridged dimeric N&#8208;heterotriangulenes were synthesized. Their successive oxidation allowed the study of the electronic coupling between the nitrogen centers. The radical cation with its strong coupling is a Class III mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer system. The dication exhibits a quinoidal structure with partial diradical character. The cationic species display strong Cotton effects extending up to 2000&#8197;nm in circular dichroism spectra.







Abstract
We report the efficient stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cations in a dimeric N&#8208;heterotriangulene bridged by a rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated [5]helicene backbone (NTH). The rigid scaffold exhibits helical chirality, allowing the enantiomers to be separated and their chiroptical properties studied, including circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Successive oxidation towards the radical cation NTH&#8901;+ and dication NTH2+ reveals strong electronic communication between the two nitrogen&#8208;centers, as demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, electrochemistry, UV/Vis/nIR spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. CD measurements of the enantiomerically pure cations reveal strong Cotton effects in the nIR region extending up to 2000&#8197;nm. Density functional theory confirms the observed enhanced electronic communication, classifying NTH&#8901;+ as a Robin&#8208;Day Class III mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer (MV&#8211;CT) system. NTH2+ exhibits a quinoidal structure with partial diradical character and open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, as shown by variable temperature EPR measurements. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy shows the photo&#8208;induced generation of NTH&#8901;+ in the presence of a suitable electron acceptor.

         <title>Intrinsic Distortion against Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Stability Na&#8208;Ion Layered Mn&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fire&#8208;new &#8220;intrinsic distortion against Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion&#8221; mechanism in Na&#8208;ion layered Mn&#8208;rich oxides, that is, counteracting the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion upon electrochemical cycling by introducing intrinsic structural distortion during the material synthesis due to their opposite deformation orientations, is unveiled to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of the cathodes.







Abstract
Layered manganese&#8208;rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid&#8208;scale sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) distortion of Mn3+ always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials. Herein, we unveil the &#8220;intrinsic distortion against J&#8208;T distortion&#8221; mechanism to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of LMRO cathodes. The intrinsic distortion simply constructed by introducing bulk oxygen vacancies is systematically confirmed by advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, atomic&#8208;scale imaging characterizations, and theoretical computations, which can counteract the J&#8208;T distortion during cycling due to their opposite deformation orientations. This greatly decreases and uniformizes the lattice strain within the ab plane and along the c axis of the material, thereby alleviating the P2&#8208;P&#8242;2 phase transition as well as suppressing the edge dislocation and intragranular crack formation upon repeated cycles. As a result, the tailored P2&#8208;Na0.72Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode featuring intrinsic distortion delivers a considerably enhanced cycling durability (91.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles) without sacrificing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox capacity (186.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;C). This intrinsic distortion engineering paves a brand&#8208;new and prospective avenue toward achieving high&#8208;performance LMRO cathodes for SIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Layered manganese-rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion of Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials.

         <title>Integrating Circular Polarized Luminescence and Long Persistent Luminescence in Cu8 Cage&#8208;Like Clusters via Ligand Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral cage&#8208;like Cu8&#8722;Cl clusters integrating circular polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) were successfully achieved via a stepwise ligand engineering approach. These are the first copper clusters to demonstrate both CPL and LPL properties, as well as the longest luminescent lifetime observed in copper clusters. This study emphasizes the importance of surface ligands in shaping the desired luminescent properties.







Abstract
Copper clusters with diverse luminescent properties are of particular interest. In this study, a series of Cu8 clusters with cage&#8208;like structures was synthesized and characterized. By employing a stepwise ligand engineering strategy that progressively introduced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties, we successfully synthesized R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8722;Cl, the first copper cluster to demonstrate both CPL and LPL. The CPL originates from the chiral metal core induced by the chiral alkynyl ligand, whereas the LPL is attributed to the inherent properties of chlorine&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine, which is retained and modified after ligation. The polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film containing Cu8 clusters displays lifetimes of up to 75.18&#8197;ms at room temperature and an afterglow exceeding 1.5&#8197;s, marking the longest luminescent lifetime recorded for molecular copper&#8208;cluster&#8208;based materials known to date. Additionally, R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8722;Cl shows excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence and variations in luminescence when UV light is switched on and off, highlighting its potential for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. This work not only presents innovative cage&#8208;like copper cluster structures but also offers new approaches for designing multifunctional clusters.

         <title>Tailoring Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose Binders for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 via Thermal Pulse Sintering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal pulse sintering is proposed to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) binder by converting carboxyl groups into ether linkages (&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8208;). This process produces uniform binder coatings on LiCoO2, forming protective layers and enhancing charge carrier pathways for high&#8208;voltage operation, paving the way for scalable and cost&#8208;effective multifunctional binder development.







Abstract
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the commercial cathode binder for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, presents several practical challenges, including insufficient conductivity, weak adhesion to active materials, and the use of toxic N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for slurry preparation. However, while most water&#8208;soluble binders can address the aforementioned issues, they fail to meet the requirements of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. In this work, we innovatively employed a thermal pulse sintering strategy to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC), enabling their application in 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 (93&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 cycles).

     alt="Tailoring Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose Binders for High-Voltage LiCoO2 via Thermal Pulse Sintering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermal pulse sintering is proposed to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) binder by converting carboxyl groups into ether linkages (-C&#8722;O&#8722;C-). This process produces uniform binder coatings on LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forming protective layers and enhancing charge carrier pathways for high-voltage operation, paving the way for scalable and cost-effective multifunctional binder development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the commercial cathode binder for lithium-ion batteries, presents several practical challenges, including insufficient conductivity, weak adhesion to active materials, and the use of toxic N-methylpyrrolidone for slurry preparation. However, while most water-soluble binders can address the aforementioned issues, they fail to meet the requirements of high-voltage cathodes. In this work, we innovatively employed a thermal pulse sintering strategy to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC), enabling their application in 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (93&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 cycles). This strategy facilitates the decomposition of electrochemically active carboxyl groups, leading to ring opening reactions that generate numerous ether linkages (-C&#8722;O&#8722;C-) without introducing undesirable side effects on LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting components form additional charge carrier (i.e., Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) pathways on the cathode surface. Additionally, the heating process also promotes uniform coating of the binder on the surface of LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, creating a protective layer that inhibits interfacial side reactions. Through proposing a scalable and economic manufacturing technology of multifunctional binder, this work enlightens the avenues for practical high-energy-density batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Using &#8220;Porous Water&#8221; for High&#8208;purity Carbon Monoxide Electrosynthesis from Dilute Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous electrolyte with high CO2 physical adsorption capacity, was constructed to continuously produce high&#8208;purity CO from dilute CO2. Interfacial CO2 concentration gradient drives the spontaneously desorption of CO2 under reductive potential, excluding other gaseous species in product stream. Combined high CO2 concentration and surface exchange between K ions and Si&#8208;OH, gives continuous production of CO with purity of 97.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% from 15&#8201;% CO2.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of high&#8208;purity carbon monoxide (CO) from captured carbon dioxide (CO2) remains energy&#8208;intensive due to the unavoidable CO2 regeneration and post&#8208;purification stages. Here, we propose a direct high&#8208;purity CO electrosynthesis strategy employing an innovative electrolyte, termed porous electrolyte (PE), based on &#8220;porous water&#8221;. Zeolite nanocrystals within PE provide permanent pores in the liquid phase, enabling physical CO2 adsorption through an intraparticle diffusion model, as demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations and in situ spectral analysis. Captured CO2 spontaneously desorbs under applied reductive potential, driven by the interfacial CO2 concentration gradient, and is subsequently reduced electrochemically. The high CO2 concentration in PE enhances mass transfer, and surface ion exchange between Si&#8722;OH groups and K+ ions on the zeolite surface generates a stronger interfacial electric field, promoting electron transfer steps. This optimized kinetics for mass and electron transfer confers heightened intrinsic activity toward CO2 electroreduction. The PE&#8208;based electrolysis system demonstrated superior CO Faradaic efficiency and partial current density compared to the conventional CO2&#8208;fed system. A circular system using PE and a Ni&#8722;N/C cathode realized continuous production of high&#8208;purity CO (97.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) from dilute CO2 (15&#8201;%) and maintained &gt;90.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% under 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with significantly reduced energy consumption and costs.

         <title>Boosting Li&#8722;CO2 Battery Performance via High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts: Insights into Configurational Entropy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different mix configurational entropy (&#9653;Smix) values supported on carbon nanofibers were designed to serve as the cathode catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, demonstrating a positive correlation between &#9653;Smix and catalytic activity.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries have attracted considerable attention for their ability to combine CO2 fixation and conversion with high&#8208;density energy storage. However, sluggish kinetics of CO2 reduction and evolution reactions at cathodes lead to large overpotentials and poor cyclic stability. To address this issue, it is critical to develop advanced cathode catalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), a new class of catalysts, have exhibited exceptional catalytic activities in various electrochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the intrinsic relationship between mix configurational entropy (&#9653;Smix) and catalytic properties of HEAs remains unclear. Herein, we prepared a series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different &#9653;Smix values supported on carbon nanofibers as cathode catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. Experimental and computational results reveal a positive correlation between &#9653;Smix and catalytic activity, attributed to charge redistribution among elements with different electronegativities. The Li&#8722;CO2 battery using the alloy catalyst with the maximum &#9653;Smix value delivers the largest capacity of 6160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, the lowest charge potential plateau below 4.0&#8197;V, and remarkable cycling stability (550&#8197;cycles/5500&#8197;h), surpassing most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, fabrication of pouch cells with low noble metal loading demonstrates the practical potential of HEAs for Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. This work provides insights into high&#8208;entropy engineering for advanced electrocatalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Organic Molecules via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free, safe mechanochemical method for hydrogenation and dehalogenation is presented. Using catalyst&#8208;plated vessels and H2 gas, various functional groups are efficiently reduced at ambient conditions. Alkenes and alkynes are fully hydrogenated in 20&#8197;min (&gt;99&#8201;% yield). Carbonyls are converted to alcohols (95&#8211;99&#8201;% yield), while nitro groups are reduced to amines (&gt;95&#8201;% yield). Dehalogenation of chloro&#8208;, bromo&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;compounds proceeds efficiently. Choice of catalyst and reaction conditions enable chemoselective transformations. This versatile approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, recyclable system for hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Mechanochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O, as well as N&#8722;O and C&#8722;X bonds is successfully achieved without the use of solvents, ligands, or catalyst powders via ball milling. A variety of catalysts are electroplated onto the walls of the milling vessel, allowing for simple recycling and reuse of the catalytic material. Hydrogen gas is directly introduced into the milling vessel, eliminating the need for hydrogen donor compounds which contribute to waste production and suboptimal atom economy. This approach enables the quantitative hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, achieving near&#8208;complete conversion within just 20 minutes at ambient temperature and pressures as low as 1.5&#8197;bar. Carbonyls, nitro groups, and organohalides were converted within reaction times of up to 12&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations suggest the reaction to be following established mechanisms for hydrogenation. Finally, chemoselective hydrogenation of various reducible functional groups was explored, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical approach with simple catalyst recycling for hydrogenation reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced theoretical modeling unveils that, under working conditions of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, the Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) undergoes potential&#8208;dependent structural evolution, which transiently generates a novel type of dangling active site that is the key to its superior activity, shedding new light on the design of highly active SACs.

The Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with an oxidation state of III anchored on the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C) delivers superior activity for catalyzing the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to produce CO, but its mechanism remains contentious and the commonly adopted FeN4&#8208;C model is not a conformant model for Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C but for Fe(II)&#8722;N&#8722;C. Herein, employing the grand&#8208;canonical ensemble modeling with the density functional theory method benchmarked against the high&#8208;level wavefunction theory method, we first identify the conformant model for Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C to be FeN1C3&#8208;C, and we then unveil that the Fe(III)N1C3&#8208;C SAC generates a novel type of dangling active site transiently under working conditions, in which the Fe single&#8208;atom leaves from the anchoring site by breaking all the Fe&#8722;C bonds but retains a stable binding to the substrate by the Fe&#8722;N bond. Thus, we further elucidate that this flexible dangling active site of Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C renders a convoluted reaction network with facile CO2 activation, which delivers superior activity for eCO2RR. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and concrete insights into the design of highly active SACs.

         <title>Binding&#8208;Site Purification of Actives (B&#8208;SPA) Enables Efficient Large&#8208;Scale Progression of Fragment Hits by Combining Multi&#8208;Step Array Synthesis With HT Crystallography</title>

&#8220;Ne te lave pas, j'arrive.&#8221; No work&#8208;up or purification required! Cheap robotics&#8208;based high throughput synthesis of crude reactions mixtures, married to high throughput X&#8208;Ray crystallography, leads to savings in time, energy and solvent use, and was applied to fragment elaboration vs the atypical bromodomain PHIP(2). Overall, &gt;1800 reactions were performed in a few weeks and 22 crystal structures were solved showing that binding can be detected on even weak fragments, with 3 showing an unexpected binding pose. A final compound displayed acceptable binding to the bromodomain (IC50=34&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Fragment approaches are long&#8208;established in target&#8208;based ligand discovery, yet their full transformative potential lies dormant because progressing the initial weakly binding hits to potency remains a formidable challenge. The only credible progression paradigm involves multiple cycles of costly conventional design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyse medicinal chemistry. We propose an alternative approach to fragment elaboration, namely performing large numbers of parallel and diverse automated multiple step reactions, and evaluating the binding of the crude reaction products by high&#8208;throughput protein X&#8208;ray crystallography. We show it is effective and low&#8208;cost to perform, in parallel, large numbers of non&#8208;uniform multi&#8208;step reactions, because, even without compound purification, crystallography provides a high&#8208;quality readout of binding. This can detect low&#8208;level binding of weakly active compounds, which the target binding site extracts directly from crude reaction mixtures. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we have expanded a fragment hit, from a crystal&#8208;based screen of the second bromodomain of pleckstrin homology domain&#8208;interacting protein (PHIP(2)), using array synthesis on low&#8208;cost robotics. We were able to implement 6 independent multi&#8208;step reaction routes of up to 5 steps, attempting the synthesis of 1876 diverse expansions, designs entirely driven by synthetic tractability. The expected product was present in 1108 (59%) crude reaction mixtures, detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). 22 individual products were resolved in the crystal structures of crude reaction mixtures added to crystals, providing an initial structure activity relationship map. 19 of these showed binding pose stability, while, through binding instability in the remaining 3 products, we could resolve a stereochemical preference for mixtures containing racemic compounds. One compound showed biochemical potency (IC50=34&#8197;&#956;M) and affinity (Kd=50&#8197;&#956;M) after resynthesis. This approach therefore lends itself to routine fragment progression, if coupled with algorithmically guided compound and reaction design and new formalisms for data analysis.

         <title>Giant Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in a Chiral Polar Crystal based on Helical One&#8208;dimensional Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical 1D lead halide perovskites crystallized in the polar C2 space group demonstrate strong circular dichroism and achieve an extraordinary 15&#8197;V open&#8208;circuit voltage via the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE). This work highlights low&#8208;dimensional crystal symmetry engineering as a transformative approach for designing high&#8208;performance BPVE materials.







Abstract
Chiral polar crystals composed of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) conducting materials exhibit unique physical phenomena. The present study focused on helical 1D&#8208;structured lead halide perovskite derivatives with chiral naphthylethylamine as organic cations, (R or S&#8208;NEA)[PbI3](R&#8208;NEA=R&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine, S&#8208;NEA=S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine). A thermally controlled crystallization method has successfully yielded crystals with a polar chiral space group of C2. The crystals show significantly intense signals of circular dichroism (CD) originating from the asymmetrical electronic transition characteristic of helical 1D structure. In addition, generation of an anomalous zero&#8208;bias photocurrent (bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)) was observed with an open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 15&#8197;V, which is five times larger than the band gap. This study suggests that parallel arrangements of the helical semiconducting materials are the promising way to obtain chiral polar crystal exhibiting high performance BPVE.

         <title>Creation of Dopant&#8208;Plasmon Synergism in Double Perovskites for Bias&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical Synthesis of Bromohydrins and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>

Lead&#8208;free Cs2AgCuBiBr6 perovskite with body&#8208;embedded Ag nanoparticles synergistically improve the utilization efficiency of photogenerated carrier and the adsorption and oxidation of Br&#8722;, ensuring the high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of bromohydrins and H2O2 in an unbiased photoelectrochemical system.







Abstract
The integration of photoexcited charge carriers into the synthesis of valuable chemicals offers substantial sustainability benefits, particularly by replacing toxic and costly oxidants and reductants typically used in conventional processes. The efficiency of such transformations is fundamentally governed by the ability to optimize light absorption and charge carrier dynamics within photoelectrodes/photocatalysts. Herein, we present a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;substituted double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 photoanode, embedded with plasmonic Ag nanoparticles, for bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical production of bromohydrins and H2O2. Spectroscopic analyses, coupled with three&#8208;dimensional finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations, demonstrate that the inclusion of Ag nanoparticles significantly enhances electromagnetic energy utilization and improves carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the Cu2+ and Ag nanoparticles results in a 7&#8208;fold increase in the yield of 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol, compared to pristine Cs2AgBiBr6, alongside an impressive H2O2 productivity of 25.8&#8197;&#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu2+ substitution strengthens Br&#8722; adsorption and oxidation, promoting the bromohydroxylation of alkenes via electrophilic addition in the bulk solution. These findings offer critical insights into the design of advanced metal halide perovskites for sustainable and solar&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <title>Identical Grain Atomic Force Microscopy Elucidates Facet&#8208;Dependent Restructuring of Copper for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron backscatter diffraction is uniquely combined with identical grain atomic force microscopy to successfully elucidate the surface topography of different Cu facets for CO2 electro&#8208;reduction. The statistic slope distribution function is introduced to quantify the topography to link the asymmetry of the surface restructuring. From this analysis, surface restructuring varies based on crystal facets, which inherit their original facet structure.







Abstract
Studies on the catalyst restructuring during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) are limited and mostly focused on Cu (001) or (111) single crystals as model systems. A comprehensive overview of the dynamic restructuring of different Cu facets is lacking. Here, we first reveal the facet&#8208;dependent restructuring of polycrystalline Cu electrodes through electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and identical grain atomic force microscopy (AFM). This combined analysis provides new insights into the evolution of crystal domains (EBSD) and surface topography (AFM) at varying conditions (e.g., applied potential and oxidative&#8208;reductive pulses). The statistic slope distribution function was applied to study the restructuring asymmetry on five Cu facets (i.e., planar vs. atom stepped). We find that planar Cu (001) shows a square&#8208;shaped morphology after eCO2RR with 4&#8208;fold asymmetry restructuring behavior, while triangular features dominate on Cu (111), evidenced by surface changes with 3&#8208;fold asymmetry. 2&#8208;fold restructuring is observed for Cu (114), (212), and (124) with atom steps, resulting in forming elongated structures. Therefore, the surface restructuring is dominated by the asymmetry of its facet lattice structure (i.e., planar vs. atom&#8208;stepped). This work underscores the potential of combining techniques to elucidate the relationship between surface restructuring and crystal facets on different length scales.

         <title>Practical High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by the In&#8208;Situ Fabrication of Main&#8208;Chain Fluorinated Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A main&#8208;chain fluorinated polymer electrolyte that integrates high oxidative resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene with lithium metal compatibility of polyether (FEOP) was developed, enabling the practical 4.7&#8197;V solid&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cells with an energy density of 405.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintain stable cycling over 70 cycles.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes are crucial for advancing safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. Therefore, such electrolytes must possess stability with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and lithium metal, ensuring efficient interfacial contact and high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity. In this study, we present a novel main&#8208;chain fluorinated polymer electrolyte, FEOP, synthesized through cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization. FEOP integrates high oxidative resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene with lithium metal compatibility of polyether, achieving an oxidation potential of up to 5.6&#8197;V and an anion&#8208;involved solvation structure. The exceptional stability enables NCM811 cells to deliver an impressive cycling life of 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;C up to 4.5&#8197;V. Furthermore, at ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.7 and 4.9&#8197;V, both NCM811 and LNMO cells demonstrate stable cycling over 700 cycles, marking the longest lifespan for polymer&#8208;based batteries under these challenging conditions. Moreover, 4.7&#8197;V solid&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cells incorporating FEOP exhibit an energy density of 405.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintain stable cycling over 70 cycles, while successfully passing industry&#8208;standard nail penetration tests. Moreover, FEOP demonstrate excellent compatibility with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading electrode (70&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), achieving an exceptional areal capacity of 16.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These results provide a solid foundation for designing practical electrolytes that enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction on M3N@C80 (M=Lu, Sc): Reactivity and Reversibility Enable Chemical Separation of Metallofullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction on M3N@Ih&#8208;C80 (M=Lu, Sc) has been utilized to yield [5,6]&#8208;closed [4+2] cycloadducts that were fully characterized (HPLC, MS, UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations). The unique reactivity and thermal reversibility of endohedral metallofullerenes enable an efficient separation strategy, thereby advancing scalable synthesis for future applications.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes are chemically more inert compared to empty fullerenes, primarily due to their intramolecular electron transfer. In this work, we report an inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction on M3N@C80 (M=Lu, Sc), where they show significantly higher reactivity than empty fullerenes. The molecular structures of the [4+2] cycloadducts were unambiguously characterized. Moreover, the cycloadducts can fully revert to pristine M3N@C80 via retro&#8208;cycloaddition upon thermal treatment. With the unusual reactivity and reversibility, the IEDDA reaction enables an effective separation approach for metallofullerenes from their soot extracts, opening path to efficient and economical scale&#8208;up synthesis of metallofullerenes in laboratory and industrial settings.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Photothermal Agents: A Universal Platform for Smart Immune NIR&#8208;Agonists for Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>

Our research presents a versatile platform for developing photoimmunotherapy agents that selectively activate immunogenic cell death in tumor cells upon NIR light irradiation, priming an effective anti&#8208;tumor immune response.







Abstract
Selective ablation of tumor cells allows safe eradication, thereby minimizing off&#8208;target damage, while specifically inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) rather than commonly non&#8208;immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells enables activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune response against residual cancer cells, including metastatic lesions. Herein, we present a general strategy leveraging a novel photothermal agent (PTA) that concomitantly enables precise tumor killing and activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The unique PTA scaffold exhibits unexpected inherent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting capability and potent near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal activity, inducing NIR&#8208;controlled immunogenic pyroptosis in various tumor cell lines via targeting ER stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner. Moreover, both ER&#8208;targeting and NIR&#8208;activity of our scaffold can be modulated on demand by chemical caging/uncaging, allowing quick activation with diverse biological and bioorthogonal molecular triggers. The potency of this universal platform is demonstrated via its application to develop a membrane protein&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;agonist that selectively activates ICD in tumor sites while priming anti&#8208;tumor immunity, minimizing off&#8208;target effects and enhancing efficacy against mouse breast tumors. This versatile approach could lead to customization of various personalized and effective immune NIR&#8208;agonists for specific photoimmunotherapy applicable to diverse solid tumors.

Switchable polymerization from mixtures of epoxide congeners can yield oxygenated block copolymers with diverse functionality, yet remains unexplored due to similar reactivities. Here, well&#8208;defined polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers were synthesized via switchable process from mixtures of terminal epoxides/internal epoxides/o&#8208;phthalaldehyde/CO2. The copolymers, with acid/base labile properties, enable sequence&#8208;controlled depolymerization.







Abstract
Switchable catalysis from monomer mixtures has been emerging as a powerful technique to synthesize various useful block copolymers, yet represents a significant challenge in polymer chemistry. Herein, we present the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers through switchable polymerization from mixtures of terminal epoxides, internal epoxides, o&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) and CO2. The exclusive chemoselectivity of terminal epoxide or internal epoxide was achieved by controlling the reaction atmosphere. The dynamic equilibrium of acetal anion and alkoxy anion is the key to the successful switch from terminal epoxides/OPA copolymerization to internal epoxides/CO2 copolymerization. Computational studies elucidated the kinetic and thermodynamic preferences underlying this selective polymerization. The acid/base labile nature of the block copolymers enables their sequence&#8208;controlled chemical recycling/degradation. These novel polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers with facilely sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization/depolymerization capabilities will enable their further tailored applications and contribute to the development of a circular plastic economy.

The Zr6 cluster in MOFs exhibits diverse connectivity (3&#8211;12), yet the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF remained elusive. Using a geometric preassembly strategy, the rare 7&#8208;connected Zr6&#8208;cluster MOFs is synthesized, bridging this gap&#8208;akin to discovering new elements in the periodic table. Finally, the narrow pores of the 7&#8208;connected MOF enable efficient hexane isomer separation.







Abstract
Zirconium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) exhibit a wide range of Zr6 cluster connectivities, from 3&#8208;connected to 12&#8208;connected, enabling diverse structural designs. However, odd&#8208;numbered connectivities, especially the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOFs, are exceptionally rare due to geometric symmetry challenges. To address this, we developed a geometric pre&#8208;assembly strategy to achieve targeted cluster connectivity. Using this approach, we synthesized NU&#8208;5001 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L)2]}, a Zr&#8208;MOF featuring 7&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters, derived from the precursor 6&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF, NU&#8208;5000 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H3&#8208;L)2]}. NU&#8208;5000, constructed with a tritopic chiral linker H3&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;[6&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,6&#8208;triyl]tribenzoic acid}, forms a (3,6)&#8208;connected ant topology. Introducing a tetratopic chiral linker, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol tetracarboxylic acid H4&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;[2,2&#8217;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,6,6&#8217;&#8208;tetrayl]tetrabenzoic acid}, enabled an additional connection, resulting in NU&#8208;5001 with a (3,4,7)&#8208;connected topology. The H4&#8208;L linker acts as either fully 4&#8208;connected or 3&#8208;connected with one arm uncoordinated. Additionally, NU&#8208;5001M {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L) (H3&#8208;L)]}, an isostructural variant, was synthesized using a mix of H3&#8208;L and H4&#8208;L linkers. NU&#8208;5001&#8217;s unique pore structure and slight flexibility enable distinct adsorption behaviors for hexane isomers, highlighting its potential for kinetic separations. This work completes the Zr6 cluster connectivity landscape and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning Zr&#8208;MOF connectivities through rational linker design, paving the way for rare, low&#8208;symmetry frameworks with tailored properties.

         <title>Engineering the Catalytic Superlattices for Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage with A high Compositional Conversion Degree</title>

The MoS2/M&#8208;ONG (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) superlattice is constructed by 100&#8201;% MoS2/M&#8208;ONG interfaces. The catalytic interface achieves excellent bidirectional reaction kinetics. During the discharge process, the conductivity and Na+ transport are enhanced through the S&#8722;M&#8722;O bond. In the charging process, the interface boosts Na2S adsorption and decomposition by single&#8208;atom Co catalyst.







Abstract
A major obstacle of transition metal disulfides in sodium&#8208;ion batteries is compositional irreversible conversion, leading to fast capacity decay. Here, we propose to engineer a catalytic superlattice structure for achieving a record&#8208;high compositional reversible conversion degree (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The superlattice is constructed by alternately stacking MoS2 layers and nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal layers (MoS2/M&#8208;ONG SL, M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) with 100&#8201;% MoS2/M&#8208;ONG interfaces, in which the metal atoms bridge the two layers through S&#8722;M&#8208;O chemical bonds. Using MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL as a model, the unique superlattice structure shows excellent electron and Na+ transport properties during discharge and charge. Moreover, the Co&#8208;ONG boosts Na2S adsorption and decomposition by forming Co&#8208;3d and S&#8208;3p hybridization. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL shows a high compositional reversible conversion degree(&#8776;100&#8201;%), as proven by a series of in&#8208;/ex situ spectroscopic analyses. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL exhibits a stable cycling stability of 300.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an ultrasmall capacity decay rate of 0.41&#8201;% per 100&#8197;cycles. This work offers a noteworthy perspective on the design and fabrication of conversion&#8208;type materials, emphasizing the crucial role of interface engineering in achieving excellent bidirectional reaction kinetics.

         <title>&#8216;Tearing Effect&#8217; of Alloy&#8211;Support Interaction for Alloy Redispersion in NiRu/TiO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; of alloy&#8208;support interaction on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles, where the NiRu nanoparticles on the interface redisperse to smaller ones like to be torn apart.







Abstract
Supported alloy catalysts have been extensively applied to many significant industrial chemical processes due to the abundant active sites with distinguishable geometry and electron states. However, a detailed in situ investigation of the interaction between support and alloy nanoparticles is still lacking. Here, a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles is in situ discovered by environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) with a dramatic redispersion process of alloy nanoparticles from ~25&#8197;nm to 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm under the repeated hydrogen reduction. Dual&#8208;driven by the distinct alloy&#8208;support interaction involving the restructuring of alloy nanoparticles and growth of TiOx overlayer, larger NiRu alloy nanoparticles spontaneously disintegrate into atoms migrating on support. Atoms are finally captured by the defects generated on TiO2 during the repeat reduction, which also confines the further growth of the newly alloy nanoparticles. Owing to this specific alloy&#8208;support interaction, smaller alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 support are much more stable than the bigger ones, which holds promise for industrial applications as durable catalysts. This novel metal&#8208;support interaction with the &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; revealed on supported alloy catalysts provides new knowledge on the structure&#8208;performance relationships in all the alloy catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

Atoms are finally captured by the defects generated on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during the repeat reduction, which also confines the further growth of the newly alloy nanoparticles. Owing to this specific alloy-support interaction, smaller alloy nanoparticles on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support are much more stable than the bigger ones, which holds promise for industrial applications as durable catalysts. This novel metal-support interaction with the &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; revealed on supported alloy catalysts provides new knowledge on the structure-performance relationships in all the alloy catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Fully Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells Based on Synergistic Ostwald Ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully screen&#8208;printed process for low&#8208;cost manufacturing significantly enhances the commercial competitiveness of perovskite solar cells. We found that a reversible and sustainable ripening process was activated by integrating MAPa/H2O in both externally and internally into perovskite crystals. The fully screen&#8208;printed PSCs exhibits an efficiency of 19.47&#8201;% and an operational stability over 1,000&#8197;h with maintaining 91.6&#8201;% of the highest efficiency.







Abstract
Fully screen&#8208;printed process for low&#8208;cost manufacturing significantly enhances the commercial competitiveness of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the controllable crystallization in screen&#8208;printed perovskite thin films using high&#8208;viscosity ionic liquids has been suggested to be difficult, which hampers further development of fully screen&#8208;printed perovskite devices in terms of application expansion and performance improvement. Here, we report a synergistic ripening strategy to fully control crystallization by employing methylamine propionate (MAPa) ionic liquid and water (H2O, moisture in the air). We found that a reversible and sustainable ripening process was activated by integrating MAPa/H2O in both externally and internally into perovskite crystals. MAPa effectively prevents the loss of organic salts and maintains the dispersion of Pb&#8208;I framework, preventing the perovskite component loss and decomposition. H2O and organic salts trends to form hydration complexes, which lowers the energy barrier and enhances the reactivity of the humidity&#8208;induced Ostwald ripening reaction. These improvements allow the screen&#8208;printed perovskite thin films achieve controlled secondary growth and ion exchange, thereby reducing defects and optimizing energy level alignment. The resulting fully screen&#8208;printed PSCs exhibits a record power conversion efficiency of 19.47&#8201;% and an operational stability over 1,000&#8197;h with maintaining 91.6&#8201;% of the highest efficiency under continuous light stress at maximum power point.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Patternable and Healable Polymer Semiconductor Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Disulfide Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both photo&#8208;patterning and thermal&#8208;healing functions have been successfully integrated into a single diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductor with relatively high charge mobility for the first time, by leveraging the dynamic covalent disulfide bonding of thioctic acid (TA) groups. The results show that thin film of P3 exhibits excellent photo&#8208;patterning capability under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, with sensitivity of 210&#8197;mJ&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and contrast of 1.2. Moreover, the scratched patterned thin films can be well healed after exposure to chloroform vapor and further thermal annealing, and simultaneously the charge mobility can be restored.







Abstract
Apart from charge transport property, polymer semiconductors with patternable and healable functions are highly demanding for the fabrication of organic circuits. Herein, by leveraging the dynamic covalent disulfide bonding of thioctic acid (TA) groups, we successfully integrate photo&#8208;patterning and thermal&#8208;healing capabilities into a single diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductor for the first time. The results show that the thin film of DPP&#8208;based conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor polymer with TA groups in the side chains exhibits excellent photo&#8208;patterning capability under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, with sensitivity (S) of 210&#8197;mJ&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and contrast (&#947;) of 1.2. Importantly, the patterning process has minimal impact on thin film morphology, interchain stacking, and charge transport mobility. Moreover, the patterned thin films, which were initially scratched, can be well healed after exposure to chloroform vapor and further thermal annealing, and simultaneously the charge mobility can be restored. In comparison, the scratched thin film of PDPP4T without TA groups in the side chains achieves only 82.6&#8201;% recovery of scratch depth and 54.5&#8201;% recovery of charge mobility under the same conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing multifunctional polymer semiconductors by incorporating TA groups in the side chains, offering a new pathway to lithography&#8208;compatible, self&#8208;healing smart flexible devices.

         <title>Redirecting On&#8208;surface Cycloaddition Reactions in a Self&#8208;assembled Ordered Molecular Array on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis on chemically inert substrates via thermal activation is extremely challenging in ultra&#8208;high vacuum, suffering from a severe &#8220;desorption problem&#8221;. Here, we report an extraordinary [2+2]+[2+2] cycloaddition via dehydrohalogenations in a highly ordered self&#8208;assembled molecular array on graphite, where the cycloaddition products are embedded as defective individuals or chains (grain boundaries) even with productivities over 30&#8201;%.







Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise carbon nanostructures in ultra&#8208;high vacuum has seen extensive progress on metal surfaces. However, this remains challenging on chemically inert surfaces. It is because the thermally activated C&#8722;C coupling encounters a severe &#8220;desorption problem&#8221; on weakly interacting substrates. In this study, we report an extraordinary [2+2]+[2+2] cycloaddition triggered by mild annealing (~210&#176;C) in a highly ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular array on graphite using scanning tunneling microscopy. In contrast to irregular dendritic fragments typically obtained on metal substrates, large supramolecular islands are observed here with cycloaddition products and other polymers over 30&#8201;%, which are embedded as defective individuals or chains (grain boundaries). First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the energy barriers of the multiple dehydrohalogenation and cycloaddition reactions are reduced by catalytic Fe atoms but remain energetically unfavorable. A distinct driving mechanism is proposed for redirecting the reactions on graphite surface, where additional intermolecular coupling, steric hindrance, and interfacial interactions play significant roles. This study introduces a new paradigm for understanding on&#8208;surface synthesis on non&#8208;metal substrates.

         <title>Synergistic Zn and MoS2 Tailored Co&#8722;N/C Environments Enabling Bifunctional ORR/OER Electrocatalysis for Advanced Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 composite catalyst was developed, leveraging the synergistic activation of Zn and MoS2 to optimize structure and electronic density. This significantly enhanced ORR/OER performance, achieving low overpotentials, ultra&#8208;high specific capacity, and long cycle life in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, demonstrating great potential for energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
To better adapt lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) and overcome their sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, designing efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic materials is essential. In this study, we successfully constructed a bifunctional ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 catalyst by tailoring the Co&#8722;N/C center with Zn incorporation and MoS2 encapsulation. Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co&#8722;N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS2 establishes Mo&#8722;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8722;N/C. In Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn and MoS2 synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO2 formation/decomposition, while Zn&#8242;s environmental adaptability and MoS2&#8242;s encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01&#8197;V, an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 25,026&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single&#8208;atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

Introducing MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; establishes Mo&#8722;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8722;N/C. In Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, Zn and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation/decomposition, while Zn&#8242;s environmental adaptability and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8242;s encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01&#8197;V, an ultra-high specific capacity of 25,026&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single-atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium-oxygen batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Post&#8208;deposition Treatment of Sb2Se3 Enables Defect Passivation and Increased Carrier Transport Dimension for Efficient Solar Cell Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a post&#8208;deposition treatment process for Sb2Se3 solar cells. Upon this treatment, the P atoms from P2O5 not only passivate the defects in Sb2Se3 film but also bring (Sb4Se6)n ribbons closer together. This suppresses the carrier recombination and increases the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% for Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.







Abstract
Post&#8208;deposition treatment in thin film preparation can compensate for the inability of directly deposited films by fundamentally altering the chemical, electrical, morphological and defect properties. However, as an emerging photovoltaic material, the synthesis of Sb2Se3 film has so far been unable to effectively adjust the carrier transport and defect properties, thereby hindering performance improvement. In this study, we report that P2O5 can serve as a post&#8208;deposition treatment material to modify the chemical and electrical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films. Through experimental analysis, we discover that P atoms from P2O5 can occupy the Se vacancy and convert the deep&#8208;level anti&#8208;site defect (SbSe) to a shallower defect (PSe), rendering efficient defect passivation. Simultaneously, P&#8208;doping induced lattice distortion closes the ribbon spacing of (Sb4Se6)n, promoting efficient carrier transport from one dimension to three dimensions. This structure reduces the restriction of carrier transport in low&#8208;dimensional materials, which suppresses the carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination and improves the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% in thermal evaporation derived Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells. This study provides a novel strategy and guidance for passivating deep&#8208;level defects and modifying the crystal structure of low&#8208;dimensional solar cell materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Emissive Oligonucleotides Grafted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal and Gene Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA is utilized as both the amphiphilic and functional molecule to modify &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and efficient photothermal properties. The resulting nanoparticles show unique and advantageous properties, including higher NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, more efficient cytoplasm delivery, and higher tissue penetration, ultimately realizing well&#8208;performed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided low&#8208;temperature PTT&#8208;gene combined therapy.







Abstract
In order to address the strong hydrophobicity and function limitation of NIR&#8208;II emissive phototheranostic &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs), appropriate modifications are necessary to impart water dispersibility and functionality to CPs. This study uses DNA as the hydrophilic and functional unit to modify CPs, synthesizing CP&#8208;g&#8208;DNA amphiphilic copolymers and producing water&#8208;dispersible oligonucleotide&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer nanoparticles (OCPNs) by self&#8208;assembly. In addition to DNA&#8242;s gene regulation abilities that can combine with the low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy of CPs for enhanced tumor therapy, OCPNs display unique characteristics as novel nanomaterials. On one side, DNA changes the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and results in a two&#8208;fold enhancement in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, which greatly benefits tumor imaging. On the other side, DNA varies the surface properties of OCPNs and the nano&#8208;bio interactions. OCPNs exhibit multiple cellular internalization pathways, including caveolae/lipid raft&#8208;mediated uptake for cytoplasm delivery, which may enhance gene transfection combined with the photothermal&#8208;promoted lysosome escape. Moreover, OCPNs can quickly accumulate in tumors due to their higher tissue penetration capability. Taken together, a strategy of using DNA to enable and advance the phototheranostic applications of CPs has been demonstrated, and the distinct properties of OCPNs will open up new biological application opportunities in the future.

         <title>Spatially Separated Redox Centers in Anthraquinone&#8208;grafted Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the process of synergistic multi&#8208;reactions for hydrogen peroxide production, the directional transport of charge carriers is crucial. We present an anthraquinone&#8208;grafted UiO&#8208;66 with piezo&#8208;photocatalytic capabilities, which enables spatially separated redox reaction sites. This strategy of separating redox sites enhances the separation and utilization efficiency of charge carriers, providing a reliable approach for green energy and environmental technologies.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air is promising but its large&#8208;scale application is still challenging as insufficient reaction active sites and low reaction efficiency. We have applied molecular engineering methods to design an anthraquinone molecularly (AQ) grafted metal&#8211;organic framework piezo&#8208;photocatalyst (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ) for H2O2 generation from water and air. The catalyst achieves a peak H2O2 yield of 7872.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 by facilitating two critical reactions: single&#8208;electron water oxidation (WOR) and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (ORR) on spatially separated redox sites. Experiments and computational simulations reveal efficient charge separation through a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;chain transfer mechanism. Electrons and holes are selectively transferred to AQ and UiO&#8208;66 promoting ORR and WOR under ultrasound and visible light. The high reaction rate of ORR (rapid generation of endoperoxide) compensates for the slow kinetics of WOR (generation of OH*) and greatly increases the rate of full&#8208;reaction of H2O2 production. Additionally, a continuous flow tubular reactor equipped with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ catalytic membranes affords 96&#8201;% removal of organic dyes by a in situFenton process under visible light and water flow, confirming the significant potential of the catalyst for practical applications. This work deepens the understanding of directional carrier migration at piezo&#8208;photocatalytic spatial separation sites, opening new pathways for environmentally friendly and efficient H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>The Ratio of sp2 and sp3 Hybridized Carbon Determines the Performance of Carbon&#8208;based Catalysts in H2O2 Electrosynthesis from O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, carbon&#8208;based catalysts are widely adopted. Our statistical analysis connivingly reveals that the ratio of sp2 to sp3 hybridized carbon, rather than the widely believed oxygen functional groups, is the key structural property determining the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Introducing oxygen&#8208; or carbon&#8208;containing functional groups is a widely adopted strategy to optimize the performance of carbon&#8208;based catalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR). Nevertheless, the specific contributions of these functional groups to enhance activity and selectivity are not well&#8208;defined and continue under debate. In this study, we systematically modified carbon materials by controlling the contents of oxygen functional groups (OFGs) and carbon functional groups (CFGs). Surface compositions were accurately quantified using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR performance was evaluated using a rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Through reliable statistical analyses, including partial least squares regression and linear regression, we explored the correlations between the surface compositional features &#8211; specifically the ratios of OFGs, CFGs, and sp2/sp3 hybridized carbon &#8211; and the catalytic performance metrics such as onset potential and H2O2 selectivity. Our findings challenge existing paradigms by demonstrating that the sp2/sp3 ratio is a critical factor in determining catalytic selectivity and a certain correlate with the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR onset potential. By tuning this ratio, we achieved nearly 100&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0.4&#8211;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and onset potential approached the thermodynamic potential (0.766&#8197;V vs. RHE for the O2/HO2&#8208; process), pointing a new direction in designing and developing advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 synthesis.

     alt="The Ratio of sp2 and sp3 Hybridized Carbon Determines the Performance of Carbon-based Catalysts in H2O2 Electrosynthesis from O2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, carbon-based catalysts are widely adopted. Our statistical analysis connivingly reveals that the ratio of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized carbon, rather than the widely believed oxygen functional groups, is the key structural property determining the catalytic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing oxygen- or carbon-containing functional groups is a widely adopted strategy to optimize the performance of carbon-based catalysts for the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;ORR). Nevertheless, the specific contributions of these functional groups to enhance activity and selectivity are not well-defined and continue under debate. In this study, we systematically modified carbon materials by controlling the contents of oxygen functional groups (OFGs) and carbon functional groups (CFGs). Surface compositions were accurately quantified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;ORR performance was evaluated using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Through reliable statistical analyses, including partial least squares regression and linear regression, we explored the correlations between the surface compositional features &#8211; specifically the ratios of OFGs, CFGs, and &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized carbon &#8211; and the catalytic performance metrics such as onset potential and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. Our findings challenge existing paradigms by demonstrating that the &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ratio is a critical factor in determining catalytic selectivity and a certain correlate with the 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;ORR onset potential. By tuning this ratio, we achieved nearly 100&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity within 0.4&#8211;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and onset potential approached the thermodynamic potential (0.766&#8197;V vs. RHE for the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; process), pointing a new direction in designing and developing advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of Degradable and Sequence&#8208;Controlled Aliphatic Polysulfones by Group Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical SO2&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of aliphatic polysulfones utilizing the strategy of group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP) is disclosed. This novel method enables the precise construction of a diverse array of aliphatic polysulfones with ABC sequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the non&#8208;desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement pathway plays a key role in the GTRP process. The obtained polymer exhibits optical properties that are comparable to those of commercially used polycarbonate. It also demonstrates complete degradability under strong basic conditions at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The incorporation of sulfur atoms into polymer backbones for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, such as aliphatic polysulfones, not only enhances degradability but also imparts many distinctive properties to these materials. Traditional synthetic methods encounter substantial challenges in achieving sequence&#8208;controlled aliphatic polysulfones with high molecular weights (MW), which significantly limits their applications. We report a novel approach for synthesizing aliphatic polysulfones using the strategy of sulfonyl radical&#8208;mediated group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP). This protocol employs a practical SO2&#8208;free pathway and produces a series of ABC sequence&#8208;defined high&#8208;MW polymers (up to 199.2&#8197;kg/mol). The resultant aliphatic polysulfone exhibits remarkable full&#8208;degradability at ambient temperature under strong basic conditions, and offers optical properties &#8211; including refractive index and Abbe number &#8211; comparable to those of commercially utilized polycarbonate. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to corroborate the non&#8208;desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement mechanism implicated in the GTRP process.

         <dc:description>
A radical approach for hydrogenative perdeuteration of unactivated alkenes under cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis was developed. The addition of a suitable base plays a key role in controlling two competing pathways by switching the catalytic performance of cobalt/photoredox catalysis. A perdeutero&#8208;arylation was also demonstrated, giving a polydeuterated heterocyclic compound with a quaternary carbon.







Abstract
A radical approach for hydrogenative perdeuteration of unactivated alkenes under cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis is described. The addition of a suitable base plays a key role in controlling two competing pathways by switching the catalytic performance of cobalt/photoredox catalysis. Base&#8208;assisted cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis promoted a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of alkenes to afford deuterated alkenes via multiple repeating deuterium atom transfer/hydrogen atom abstraction processes, while consecutive reductive deuteration of alkenes proceeded in the absence of a base to afford polydeuterated alkanes. One&#8208;pot hydrogenative perdeuteration and perdeutero&#8208;arylation were also developed, providing access to various polydeuterated aliphatic compounds.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalysts Derived from Water&#8208;Induced Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Aerogel for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast transformation process and underlying formation mechanism of water&#8208;induced pure metal&#8211;organic framework aerogels are demonstrated. The derived edge&#8208;enriched oxygen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom nickel sites anchored on the defective carbon belts (a&#8208;Ni/DCBs) display excellent catalytic activity and durability toward electrochemical water oxidation, resulting from the optimized electronic structure and reduced thermodynamic energy barrier.







Abstract
Research on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) aerogels is relatively scarce, primarily constrained by the limited availability of synthetic methods. Herein, a water&#8208;induced rapid conversion process of MOF powder to MOF aerogel is demonstrated, where the macroscopic transition is essentially due to the reassembly of microscopic constituent units and the rapid alteration of morphological structure. The derived catalyst possesses abundant holes left by the acid leaching process, leading to the high enrichment of O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites on the concomitant carbon edges. Consequently, such a catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, only requiring a low overpotential of 279&#8197;mV to drive the benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the reduced OER energy barrier over the edge&#8208;enriched O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites, as compared with internal O&#8208;coordinated sites and traditional N&#8208;coordinated sites. This is primarily attributed to the optimization effect of distinctive O&#8208;coordinated structure and synergistic edge effect on the electronic structure of active Ni centers.

         <title>Unraveling the Essential Role of Consecutive Protonation Steps in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction when Using Au Nanorods in a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of Au nanorods not only improves the selectivity and production rate of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction but also provides crucial insights into the pivotal role of protonation steps and reaction intermediates, particularly highlighting the rate&#8208;determining *CO to *CHO conversion.







Abstract
The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process (PCET) plays a crucial role in both natural and artificial photosynthesis, including CO2 fixation chemistry. However, difficulties in capturing the transient intermediates generated during the protonation process impede the clarification of the fundamental mechanism behind photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Herein, we report a general killing two birds with one stone strategy by spatially confining Au nanorods within a typical porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Interestingly, 2.4&#8208;fold increase in CH4/CO selectivity and 12&#8208;fold increase in CH4 production were observed after loading of Au nanorods, indicative of a strengthened protonation process in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. More importantly, the plasmonic effect from Au nanorods simultaneously boosted the in&#8197;situ Raman signals of *CO and *CHO intermediates on the Au&#8722;O&#8722;Zr active site. The evident protonation process was further clarified in a control H/D kinetic isotope experiment. This work highlights the significance of successive protonation steps for boosting CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Multifunctional Polymer Interphase with Fast Kinetics for Ultrahigh&#8208;rate Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quinone polymer (PPPA) interphase with a planar and linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure can significantly boosts the performance of AZIBs. The expansion of &#960;&#8208;conjugated planes in PPPA molecules accelerates the transfer of intramolecular electrons during charge/discharge, which boosts the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+, redistributes Zn2+ flux and facilitates diffusion of Zn2+. This results in dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;rate Zn deposition.







Abstract
Polymer interphase on Zn anodes obviates dendrite growth and significant side reactions including corrosion and hydrogen evolution in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), however has drawbacks of slow kinetics and large overpotential for Zn plating/stripping that prevent practical application especially under high&#8208;rate conditions. Here, a multifunctional polymer interphase with fast kineticsis reported, using poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) as an electrolyte additive. PPPA, with linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and enriched polar pyridine (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to form a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in situ. The PPPA SEI is efficient to block direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode, and regulate the interfacial solvation structure and Zn depostion. Importantly, the expanding &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of PPPA is shown to provide abundant 2D open channels for rapid Zn2+ transport, and the delocalized &#960; electrons form a space electrostatic field to facilitate de&#8208;solvation and diffusion of Zn2+. As a result, the Zn metal anode with PPPA/ZnSO4 electrolyte exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3 % at current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201; cm&#8722;2, and excellent cycle lifespan for over 2000 cycles (400&#8197;h) at current density 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and plating/stripping capacity of 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||MnO2 full battery exhibited a discharge capacity of 74.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles at the current density of 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, demonstrating practical feasibility. It is concluded that judicious engineering of polymer additives and interphase will benefit the development of commercial AZIBs with fast kinetics for high&#8208;rate applications.

Exploring the High&#8208;Pressure Induced Abnormal Blueshift in MnS@CdS QDs: Unlocking New Mechanisms for Optoelectronic Applications







Abstract
Mn d&#8722;d emission has been a star transition&#8208;metal activated phosphors that were extensively used in optoelectronic devices. However, due to the complex and elusive luminescence mechanism, the full potential of this material remains largely untapped. Here, we designed a core&#8211;shell structure of MnS@CdS quantum dots (QDs) to investigate the effect of the internal strain on the Mn emission. Upon pressure processing, an unexpected blueshift of Mn emission was achieved. When the pressure reached a pressure of 2.1&#8197;GPa, the conventional redshift of Mn emission reappeared. Remarkable color transition from red to orange and then back to red was observed during pressure treatment. Further analysis revealed that the application of external pressure facilitated the diffusion of Mn atoms into the CdS shell, strengthened host&#8208;dopant coupling and mitigated the lattice mismatch rate within the MnS@CdS QDs. These factors resulted in a reduction in phonon coupling strength and an increase in energy transfer efficiency from the exciton of the CdS host lattice to the Mn dopants, thus ultimately accounting for the abnormal blueshift of Mn d&#8722;d emission. Our findings represent a significant breakthrough in the quest for precise control and regulation of Mn&#8208;related emission, offering insights into the underlying luminescence mechanism of Mn emission.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electric Field of an S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction by an Ultrasonication&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Effect for Sonocatalytic Therapy of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with traditional antibiotic therapy, photo&#8208; and sonodynamic therapies generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for effectively combating drug resistance. This study address challenges in the low ROS generation efficiency of piezoelectric materials and sonosensitizers through molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy indicates advantages in combating antibiotics&#8208;resistant bacteria and deep tissue infections, but challenges remain in the less efficient charge transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of sonosensitizers. Herein, an effective bactericidal strategy is developed through enhancing the interfacial electric field (IEF) of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions by an ultrasonication&#8208;triggered piezoelectric effect. Hollow barium titanate (hBT) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared through template etching, followed by in situ assembly of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with Zn2+ to obtain hBT@ZnTCPP. Both experimental and theoretical evidences support the notion that an IEF is generared from ZnTCPP to hBT. Compared to metalloporphyrins with Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+, the stronger reduction of ZnTCPP induced by elevation of the orbital energy level of porphyrins after Zn2+ coordination leads to formation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The ultrasonication&#8208;activated polarization field enhances IEF and boosts energy band bending of hBT@ZnTCPP to promote electron&#8208;hole separations and ROS generations. Planktonic methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and their derived biofilms are completely destroyed within 5&#160;min under ultrasonication through up&#8208;regulating genes of glucose catabolism and ion transportation and down&#8208;regulating genes of ribosomal synthesis and transmembrane transporter. Thus, this study demonstrates molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic therapy of bacterial infections.

         <title>Polar Three&#8208;dimensional Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Realize Highly Sensitive Self&#8208;driven Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide hybrid perovskite has been reported to drive highly sensitive self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection due to its superior semiconducting attributes and bulk photovoltaic effect. This work further promotes the development of high&#8208;performance ultraviolet photodetection and provides a new path for assembling novel optoelectronic devices without external bias voltage.







Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) triggered by spontaneous polarization in polar organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has brought unprecedented development opportunities for self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection. However, the currently reported ultraviolet optoelectronic devices are dominated by low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites, in which low carrier mobility limits the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time a polar three&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, namely MHyPbBr3 (1, MHy=methylhydrazine), that achieves high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven ultraviolet photodetection. Benefitting from the large spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconductor attributes, 1 exhibits 0.33&#8197;V BPVE and high carrier mobility lifetime product (&#956;&#964;) of 1.972&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm&#8722;2&#8201;V&#8722;1 under ultraviolet illumination. Notably, such merits contribute to efficient self&#8208;driven photodetection, where responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) reach up to 198&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 and 1.42&#215;1013 Jones, surpassing most reported ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, based on the reversible phase transition of 1, we have achieved controllable ultraviolet photoelectric detection. This work will shed light on the fabrication of high&#8208;response self&#8208;driven ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Extendable Synthesis of Organic Cations for In Situ Construction of Hybrid Metal Halides with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence and Strong Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extendable synthetic strategy has been developed for in situ construction of a library of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) with tailored sulfonium A&#8208;site organic cations. The template reaction with precise modular and regioselective control enables tuning of the reactants and reaction pathway, resulting in functional OIHMHs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) or strong second harmonic generation (SHG).







Abstract
The A&#8208;site organic components of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) significantly impact their crystal structure and optoelectronic properties. However, chemical modification of A&#8208;site cations has been mostly limited to commercial organic precursors, which restricts the structural variability of OIHMHs for optimal functionalities. Herein we have proposed an extendable synthesis approach to the direct procurability of various organic cations with desireable structures for the in situ construction of a library of OIHMH materials. The template condensation reaction between dimethyl sulfoxide and acetone derivatives yields A&#8208;site organic cations with exquisite control of modularization and regioselectivity within the OIHMH crystallization system. The as&#8208;fabricated OIHMHs demonstrated highly efficient linear optical photoluminescence or nonlinear optical second harmonic generation, promising potential applications in photonic devices. This in situ synthetic strategy offers a structural extension of OIHMHs and establishes a fundamental methodological platform for screening functional OIHMH materials.

         <title>Triplet Exciplex Mediated Multi&#8208;Color Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow Mate&#8208;rials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bi&#8208;component room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that display a near&#8208;infrared afterglow have been prepared. The triplet state of the host has been shown to transfer energy to the dopant via a triplet exciplex, leading to a highly persistent emission.







Abstract
Organic long&#8208;lived phosphorescent materials demonstrating ultra&#8208;long photoluminescence have practical advantages owing to their flexible design and easy processability. However, the exact photophysical process underpinning the persistent&#8208;luminescent continues to elude full understanding, and the principles governing the compatibility of hosts and guests remain elusive. In this work, a new type of nonradiative energy transfer mechanism is proposed for the bi&#8208;component RTP system. Different from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter&#8208;type energy transfer, this energy transfer mechanism primarily relies on a triplet exciplex to exchange the electron. This facilitates the formation of triplet excitons that are otherwise difficult to excite directly. An evaluation methodology is devised to gauge the potential of a specific dopant&#8208;host combination toward generating pronounced afterglow. According to this framework, the enhancement of the afterglow is proportional to the decrease in the activation energy (&#916;G&#8800;) associated with the electron transfer reaction between the dopant and the host. Notably, when the &#916;G&#8800; too larger, no observable afterglow occurs, as higher &#916;G&#8800; values significantly impede the electron transfer reaction between the two components. Furthermore, the remarkable dependence of afterglow intensity on the dopant concentration renders the bi&#8208;component RTP system highly promising for applications requiring ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and broad&#8208;spectrum detection capabilities.

         <title>Efficient Methane Purification Using a Robust and Recoverable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions have led to an ultra&#8208;microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on a tetratopic bithiophene derivative. The HOF is characterized by good chemical stability even in concentrated acid and base solutions, and dense packing density and high adsorption selectivity toward acetylene and carbon dioxide for efficient purification of methane, as well as facile material regeneration.







Abstract
Efficient separation and purification of methane is a key step in promoting its wide application as an environmentally friendly energy carrier and an important chemical raw material. Development of single solid adsorbents simultaneously combining robust structure, high separation capacity, and easy performance recovery is highly desired but quite a challenge for realizing methane depuration. In the present study, we report an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework compound constructed from a tetracyano bithiophene&#8208;functionalized ligand. Similar to the acting principle of enzymes, multisite supramolecular interactions endow the material with not only extraordinary chemical stability in wide pH range including 12&#8197;M HCl and 20&#8197;M NaOH solutions but also highly selective recognition of acetylene and carbon dioxide over methane. The packing densities and adsorption selectivities toward acetylene and carbon dioxide are the highest reported for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework materials. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its highly efficient methane purification ability from binary and even ternary mixed gases, with not only methane productivities up to 2.34&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 but also moderate regeneration energy. Furthermore, the title compound can be easily regenerated in almost quantitative yield via simple rato&#8208;evaporation of its dichloromethane solution once its activity is attenuated or lost.

         <title>Step&#8208;Edge Guided Homoepitaxy Enables Highly Reversible Zn Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a step&#8208;edge guided homoepitaxy mechanism to precisely regulate nucleation, growth and the reversibility of Zn anode, which enables ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. The resultant Zn(0002) epitaxy achieves unprecedented reversibility and stability over thousands of hours in Zn metal batteries. Reversible electrochemical epitaxy may bring breakthrough toward energy&#8208;dense metal batteries.







Abstract
Metal anodes are of profound impact towards the realization of energy&#8208;dense rechargeable batteries. However, the &#8220;hostless&#8221; metal redox always presents the disordered plating/stripping, aggravated by the side reactions and local anisotropy that cause the formation of excessive dendrites/voids and quickly lead to battery failure. Here we report step&#8208;edge guided homoepitaxy enabling ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Zn plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. Through engineering the atomic terrace height on the mono&#8208;oriented Zn(0002) foil anodes, both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane epitaxy aligned to the underlying Zn lattice are demonstrated via the favored edge nucleation and strong interfacial interaction driven by the surface/interface energy minimization, achieving the electrochemical homoepitaxy of continuous, submillimeter&#8208;scale Zn(0002) crystal with nearly 100&#8201;% theoretical density. Accordingly, we achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;%, high depths of discharge exceeding 51&#8201;% and 82&#8201;% along with record&#8208;high lifetimes of over a thousand and hundreds of hours, respectively, in zinc metal batteries. The breakthrough results provide new insights on the intrinsic metal plating/stripping from the view of reversible homoepitaxy for rechargeable energy&#8208;dense metal batteries.

Abstract
Achieving efficient long&#8208;wavelength organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge due to the energy gap law, which leads to increased non&#8208;radiative decay rates as the emission wavelength shifts to longer regions. Herein, a strategy of constructing folded three&#8208;dimensional architectures is proposed to explore new orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics. Innovatively, naphthalene is selected as a bridge to connect O&#8208;bridged triphenylamine donor and planar dibenzo[a,c]phenazine acceptor respectively via simple Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling. In this way, a series of rigid orange&#8208;red emitters with &#8220;U&#8221;&#8208;shaped, folded &#8220;Z&#8221;&#8208;shaped and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped configurations are elaborately constructed by modifying end groups, adjusting the numbers of naphthalene and donor, and regulating the linkage sites. The excited state natures and photophysical properties of the emitters can be effectively regulated and optimized by changing three&#8208;dimensional architectures. Finally, the prepared emitter QX36 achieves a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate, a higher radiative rate and a higher photoluminescence quantum efficiency. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based QX36 present the excellent electroluminescent performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.3&#8201;% and EQE of 20.6&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which are the leading values of solution&#8208;processed orange&#8208;red OLEDs. This work demonstrates the promising potential of folded TADF based naphthalene backbone as emitters for future efficient solution&#8208;processed long&#8208;wavelength OLEDs.

The click chemist's playground: The most important certainty&#8208;of&#8208;chance outcome of click chemistry was the realization that perfect reactions can exist. Chemistry is about bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking reactions between atoms and molecules. So, the emergence of &#8220;perfect reaction&#8221; status promises to be transformative to the very heart of chemistry, and thence to the range of benefits for mankind that its future evolution may hold.

         <title>Smart Targeting Layer on Silver Nanowire Electrodes Achieving Efficiency Breakthroughs in ITO&#8208;Free Conventional Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored functional targeted molecules to form self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) that precisely wrap around the surface of silver nanowire electrodes. This smart targeting layer enables simultaneous flexible work function tuning and hydrophilicity enhancement for silver nanowire electrodes, resulting in efficiency breakthroughs in conventional flexible organic solar cells with ITO&#8208;free electrodes and exceptional mechanical flexibility.







Abstract
Silver nanowire (AgNW) electrodes, known for their intrinsic flexibility and tunable optoelectronic properties, have garnered considerable attention for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in conventional OSCs, their low work function (WF) causes energy&#8208;level mismatches with classic aqueous hole transport layers (HTLs), while their poor hydrophilicity hinders the formation of optimized HTL morphology and crystallinity, posing challenges to their integration into high&#8208;performance OSCs. To address these issues, functionally targeted molecules with a thiol group at one end and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing, hydrophilic functional groups at the other are precisely engineered to wrap around the AgNW electrodes. The thiol group facilitates the formation of robust self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) on the AgNW electrodes through stable S&#8722;Ag chemical bonds at room temperature. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups generate notable molecular and interfacial dipoles that effectively raise the WF of AgNW electrodes. Notably, the hydrophilic groups not only improve electrode wettability but also promote strong hydrogen bonding interactions with HTL, leading to substantial improvements in the morphology and crystallinity of the HTL. This precision wrapping strategy enables the fabrication of high&#8208;efficient conventional flexible OSCs, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 18.84&#8201;% (certified at 18.56&#8201;%) for flexible OSCs based on ITO&#8208;free transparent electrodes.

         <title>Leveraging Carbon Quantum Dot Spacers as Dual Proton/Electron Boosters to Upgrade TiO2@Polydopamine Photocatalysts for pH&#8208;Resilient Conversion of O2 into H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CDs act as spacers to buffer the concentration of protons of the interspatial microenvironment between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, which sustain high and stable local acidity therein and, at the same time, boost the transfer of protons and photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 cores to their PDA shells with excellent kinetic matching with each other.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, which is generally jeopardized by the kinetic mismatch between photogenerated electron transfer and proton supply. To address the challenge, here we proposed a new core&#8211;shell design of nanocomposite catalysts comprising of carbon quantum dot (CD)&#8208;topped TiO2 nanoparticles encapsulated by polydopamine (PDA) shells, which delivered stable catalytic activity across a pH range of 1&#8211;9, exhibiting a photocatalytic generation rate of H2O2 that reached 18.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in methanol and 8.66&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in water. This extraordinary, pH&#8208;tolerant photocatalytic generation of H2O2 was benefited from the innovative use of CDs, interspaced between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, not only as a reservoir of protons to buffer the local acidic microenvironment but also as a proton/electron dual booster to sustain an excellent kinetic match between the proton and photogenerated electron transfer, thus enabling the O2 reduction to selectively proceed via two&#8208;electron reaction pathway over a wide pH span.

         <title>Mass Activity Elucidation of Cobalt&#8208;Based Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Utilizing Depth&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy in the Presence of Various Cations with Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass activity of oxygen evolution reaction over cobalt oxide (CoOx) deposited on Ti substrate decreases with higher loading because of the non&#8208;uniform distribution of the active layer in the bulk direction. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis reveals that the active layer is affected by the dissolved alkali metal cations rather than chloride ions, resulting in a distinct performance.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis is a kinetically sluggish reaction that requires catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity. Cobalt oxide (CoOx) is among the best performing OER catalysts and has been reported to have &#8220;bulk activity&#8221; with active sites distributed within the material. Herein, we examined the distribution of OER activity over &#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2 loaded CoOx deposited on anti&#8208;corrosive Ti substrate in 1&#8197;M KOH with and without various cations with chloride (X&#8722;Cl, X=Li, Na, K). Depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed. In a thin sample with ~20&#8197;nm thickness, uniform oxidation was observed, but a thicker sample with ~80&#8197;nm thickness had active oxidized phases close to the surface and an unexpected inactive Co0 phase concurrently occupying about three&#8208;quarters of the CoOx layer in the depth direction, which accounted for the mass activity loss. The formation of Co0 in the bulk is attributed to the galvanic replacement reaction between CoOx and the metallic Ti substrate, which is not observed on the carbon substrate. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the type of cations rather than Cl&#8722; impacts the OER performance likely due to their interaction with superoxo species.

Herein, we examined the distribution of OER activity over &#956;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; loaded CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; deposited on anti-corrosive Ti substrate in 1&#8197;M KOH with and without various cations with chloride (X&#8722;Cl, X=Li, Na, K). Depth-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed. In a thin sample with ~20&#8197;nm thickness, uniform oxidation was observed, but a thicker sample with ~80&#8197;nm thickness had active oxidized phases close to the surface and an unexpected inactive Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; phase concurrently occupying about three-quarters of the CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layer in the depth direction, which accounted for the mass activity loss. The formation of Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in the bulk is attributed to the galvanic replacement reaction between CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and the metallic Ti substrate, which is not observed on the carbon substrate. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the type of cations rather than Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; impacts the OER performance likely due to their interaction with superoxo species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>H&#8208;Bonds in Carbon Quantum Dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 to Boost Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer for Piezoelectric&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process based on carbon quantum dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) was constructed for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. The intermolecular H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5 accelerate PCET in the ORR, and this facilitated the adsorption of O2 onto the C sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway.







Abstract
Tuning proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. CQDs&#8208;C3N5 exhibited a remarkable piezo&#8208;catalytic synthesis rate of 5025&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under ambient conditions, surpassing that of most reported piezoelectric materials. This efficiency is attributed to the intermolecular H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5, which significantly accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric&#8208;generated charges, from the dipole field of the C3N5 plane, and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H&#8208;bond networks. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto the C2 sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway. Additionally, a piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction system was constructed for oxytetracycline&#8208;rich wastewater purification, with effectively effects on chemical oxygen demand, antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and antibiotic&#8208;resistant genes degradation, etc. This study highlights the critical role of H&#8208;bond networks for tuning PCET in the ORR and provides a comprehensive understanding for the precise control of catalytic reaction kinetics through molecular structural engineering.

         <title>Intrinsically Photothermal&#8208;Driven and Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Enabled by Multifunctional Dynamic Covalent Organic Photothermal Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional photothermal molecule is introduced for the fabrication of novel versatile light&#8208;driven reconfigurable liquid crystal elastomers. The obtained materials possessed both photothermal&#8208;responsiveness and reconfigurability. Three demonstration models, a biomimetic flower, a soft gripper, and a weightlifting actuator have been created to demonstrate the reconfigurability of actuators.







Abstract
Intrinsically photothermal&#8208;responsive soft actuators possessing reconfigurability have attracted great attention due to their ability to change their actuation mode to satisfy diverse practical applications. However, challenges remain in designing and fabricating organic photothermal molecules featuring polymerizable or cross&#8208;linkable groups, especially those with multifunctional properties. Here, a novel class of versatile light&#8208;driven reconfigurable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, denoted as PUOLCE, has been developed. The multifunctional dynamic covalent organic photothermal molecules, serving as chain extenders, photothermal agents, and dynamic covalent bond precursors, are chemically bonded into LCEs, thereby endowing the LCEs with photothermal&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic properties. The intrinsic photothermal effect of PUOLCE allows the exchange reaction of dynamic oxime&#8208;carbamate bonds to undergo rapid welding under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Leveraging the NIR&#8208;assisted welding strategy, the PUOLCE&#8208;based building units are capable of assembling into various complex actuators with new deformation modes. Besides, the assembled actuators can be easily reconfigured to perform different mechanical tasks (e.g., flower blooming, grasping objects, and elevating objects) under NIR illumination. Furthermore, the PUOLCE actuators can be controlled globally or locally for light&#8208;driven locomotion by controlling the area exposed to the NIR irradiation. This work provides insights into the development of adaptive soft actuators with tunable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities.

         <title>An Authentic Al=Si Double Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first example of a bona fide Al=Si double bond stabilized in a four&#8208;membered anionic AlSi3 cycle, which exhibits an unprecedentedly short Al&#8722;Si bond length of 2.283(1)&#8197;&#197; and a high Wiberg bond index (WBI) of 1.31. We illustrate the typical double bond reactivity through the intramolecular activation of C&#8722;H bonds of the Tip group (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), as well as through intermolecular reactions with sulfur sources.







Abstract
Aluminatasilenes are the elusive heavier counterparts of the well&#8208;known borataalkenes in which the B=C double bond is formally replaced by an Al=Si moiety. We report the isolation of a four&#8208;membered anionic AlSi3 cycle with a bona fide Al=Si double bond, which is obtained by the reaction of 2&#8197;eq. of disilenide Tip2Si=SiTipLi with H2AlCl (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl). X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis confirm the double bond character with a very short Al&#8722;Si bond of 2.283(1)&#8197;&#197; and high Wiberg bond index (WBI) of 1.31. Intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by the Al=Si bond and the reactions with sulfur sources confirm typical double bond reactivity.

         <title>Localized Alkaline Microenvironments Enhanced upon Tip Effects for Efficient Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuO nanowires can effectively accumulate OH&#8722; in the solution through the tip&#8208;enhanced effect, creating a highly alkaline microenvironment and thereby providing conditions for electrochemical in situ disinfection.







Abstract
The electrochemical disinfection mechanism primarily relies on a high&#8208;voltage pulsed electric field and electrocatalytic generation of highly oxidative radicals but suffers from shortcomings of either high voltages (dozens of kV) or significant gas supply. This study proposes an in situ electrocatalytic sterilization strategy that forms localized alkaline microenvironments in neutral electrolytes under a constant current of &#8722;12&#8197;mA at a relatively lower voltage (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE). The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H3O+) from the solution during H2 evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH&#8722;, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and finite element analysis (FEA) reveal that the nanowire&#8208;derived tip&#8208;enhanced effect significantly enhances OH&#8722; accumulation around the cathode, effectively inactivating Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 107&#8197;CFU/mL within 3 minutes at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V. The resulting increase in OH&#8722; concentration drives rapid sterilization by inhibiting bacterial ATP synthesis and inducing oxidative stress. This method can efficiently inactivate microorganisms in a short time, while having minimal impact on the overall pH of the environment, making it a safe and environmentally friendly approach.

This study proposes an &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; electrocatalytic sterilization strategy that forms localized alkaline microenvironments in neutral electrolytes under a constant current of &#8722;12&#8197;mA at a relatively lower voltage (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE). The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the solution during H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and finite element analysis (FEA) reveal that the nanowire-derived tip-enhanced effect significantly enhances OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation around the cathode, effectively inactivating &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;) at 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;CFU/mL within 3 minutes at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V. The resulting increase in OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration drives rapid sterilization by inhibiting bacterial ATP synthesis and inducing oxidative stress. This method can efficiently inactivate microorganisms in a short time, while having minimal impact on the overall pH of the environment, making it a safe and environmentally friendly approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Precise Prediction of Micro&#8208; and Supra&#8208;pKa Based on 3D Descriptors Integrating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor, explicitly vectorizes molecular environments around protons, capturing covalent, non&#8208;covalent, and solvent effects for precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions. H&#8208;SPOC achieves the highest accuracy across SAMPL benchmarks, resolves stereoelectronic anomalies, predicts crystal&#8208;phase pKa variations, and correlates pKa with reaction rates, selectivity and pharmacokinetics, expanding its potential applications in drug design, molecular catalysis and materials science.







Abstract
Accurate pKa prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems. However, existing models often face challenges in addressing subtle stereoelectronic effects and conformational flexibility. This study presents H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor that captures covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions and incorporates solvent effects to predict site&#8208;specific pKa values accurately. H&#8208;SPOC was validated on multiple benchmark datasets, including SAMPL6, SAMPL7, and SAMPL8, where it outperformed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. H&#8208;SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including 2&#8208;acetoxybenzoic acid (the main components of aspirin) non&#8208;equilibrium conformations, glycine&#8216;s microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra&#8208;pKa predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated pKa with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H&#8208;SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.

         <title>Insights into Co&#8208;Catalytic Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Support Interactions for Boosting Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions between cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts and graphitic carbon nitride (Co&#8208;GCN) facilitate strong binding with lithium polysulfides through the formation of Li&#8722;N and Co&#8722;S bonds. This co&#8208;contribution of Co&#8208;GCN significantly lowers the activation energy (Ea) for the sulfur reduction reactions, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect and resulting in an enhanced electrochemical performances in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with abundant electrocatalytic centers has been identified as the most desirable strategy to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, the co&#8208;contribution from SAC and its support via their interactions for accelerating the sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) has so far received little attention, since the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, guided by density functional theory calculations, Cobalt&#8208;SACs supported on a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (Co&#8208;GCN), are selected to elucidate the co&#8208;catalytic role in enhancing the SRR. The inherent high charge polarity of GCN, combined with its unique tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine structure, offers multiple binding sites for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through Li&#8722;N bonds, as well as N/C&#8208;coordinated frameworks for anchoring Co&#8208;SACs. This structural configuration further amplifies the interaction with LiPSs via Co&#8722;S bonds. Consequently, both Co&#8208;SACs and GCN actively participate in sulfur reduction electrocatalysis by binding LiPS intermediates, lowering the conversion energy barrier of SRR. Benefitting from such unique synergy, the battery demonstrates outstanding rate performance (718.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;C) and yields a high areal capacity of up to 13.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1584.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) under a high areal sulfur loading of 8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 but a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1.

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Detecting Organic Semiconductors Featuring a Tetraheterocyclic Core with Reduced Ionization Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron acceptor containing an asymmetric tetraheterocyclic core with a reduced ionization potential has been shown to exhibit a narrow optical band gap of 1.00&#8197;eV and a remarkably low Urbach energy of 22.0&#8197;meV. The fabricated organic photodetectors demonstrate high specific detectivities comparable to those of germanium photodetectors at wavelengths below 1.2&#8197;&#956;m.







Abstract
Infrared organic semiconductors are crucial in organic optoelectronics, yet high&#8208;performance materials with photoresponse beyond 1.1&#8197;&#956;m (the limit of crystalline silicon) remain scarce due to the limit of building blocks including strong electron&#8208;donating units. Here, we report an asymmetric tetraheterocycle (TPCT) with a reduced ionization potential of 6.18&#8197;eV relative to those reported dithiophene&#8208;based electron&#8208;donating blocks, and TPCT&#8208;2F and TPCTO&#8208;2F constructed with TPCT as the core exhibit absorption onset up to 1&#8197;&#956;m and 1.4&#8197;&#956;m, respectively. Especially, TPCTO&#8208;2F possesses a narrow band gap of 1.00&#8197;eV and displays a small Urbach energy of 22.0&#8197;meV comparable to or even lower than those of some typical inorganic short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) semiconductors (13&#8211;44&#8197;meV). The organic photodetectors (OPDs) based on TPCT&#8208;2F achieve a peak detectivity (D*) of 2.2&#215;1013 Jones at 810&#8197;nm under zero bias, among the highest values for reported OPDs and on par with commercial silicon photodetectors. Impressively, TPCTO&#8208;2F&#8208;based OPDs demonstrate a wide response from 0.3 to 1.4&#8197;&#956;m and high D* comparable to germanium photodetector at wavelengths &lt;1.2&#8197;&#956;m with a maximum D* of 2.3&#215;1011 Jones at 1.06&#8197;&#956;m in SWIR region.

         <title>Integrating Two Photochromics into One Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Synergistically Enhancing Multiple Photocatalytic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating porphyrin and triphenylamine photochromics together, a photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed. The COF can synergistically enhance generation of both &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 for broad photocatalytic aerobic oxidations, demonstrating that precisely integrating multiple photochromics into one COF is a powerful strategy for the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for wide photoreactions.







Abstract
While photocatalytic oxidations are a category of important reactions in wide chemical synthesis, the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for broad oxidation reactions is still of a great challenge. Herein, by rationally integrating two photochromics, porphyrin and triphenylamine, a three&#8208;dimensional photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed for photocatalytic oxidations.

&lt;p&gt;By integrating porphyrin and triphenylamine photochromics together, a photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed. The COF can synergistically enhance generation of both &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for broad photocatalytic aerobic oxidations, demonstrating that precisely integrating multiple photochromics into one COF is a powerful strategy for the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for wide photoreactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While photocatalytic oxidations are a category of important reactions in wide chemical synthesis, the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for broad oxidation reactions is still of a great challenge. Herein, by rationally integrating two photochromics, porphyrin and triphenylamine, a three-dimensional photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed for photocatalytic oxidations. Characterization studies not only show the formation of a crystalline and three-dimensional porous framework, but also reveal its effective photochemical semiconductor properties derived from the porphyrin and triphenylamine moieties. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements indicate that the COF is an effective photocatalyst for the generation of both singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and superoxide radical anions (&#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Synergistically enhanced efficiency in all photocatalytic reactions of photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of alkylbenzenes and silanes as well as thioanisoles, and cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction of N-phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline and indole is confirmed by both experimental and theoretical studies, demonstrating its promising potential for broad photocatalytic oxidation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Enable Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded ether groups significantly enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons in COFs, and promote electron accumulation at the C=N imine bonds, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable solar fuels is a promising strategy for addressing energy crises and mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, the challenge of efficiently regulating photogenerated electrons to CO2 active sites remains a key hurdle for high&#8208;performance CO2 reduction. Herein, an embedded functional group, ether group is introduced into porphyrin&#8208;triazine COFs to regulate the transfer behavior of photogenerated electrons. The ether&#8208;embedded COFs (TOT&#8208;TAPP, BOD&#8208;TAPP and QOB&#8208;TAPP) demonstrate significantly faster charge transport and higher photoactivity compared with the corresponding non&#8208;ether&#8208;embedded counterpart COFs. The theoretical calculations and in situ characterizations reveal that the ether group could not only accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, but also lead to a more substantial accumulation of electrons at the CO2 adsorption region (C=N imine bond), thus greatly promoting the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Activating Organic Electrode for Zinc Batteries via Adjusting Solvation Structure of Zn Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ in organic electrolytes limits the Zn2+ storage performance of organic electrodes, particularly in thick electrodes with high mass loading. Here, adding 2&#8201;% H2O to an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O molecules into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly accelerating the de&#8208;solvation process and enabling the thick poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) electrode to exhibit high performance.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;organic batteries, combining the low cost and high capacity of Zn anodes with the tunable and sustainable properties of organic cathodes, have garnered significant attention. Herein, we present a zinc&#8208;organic battery featuring a poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) cathode, a Zn anode, and an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte, which delivers a high capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life (10,000 cycles) when tested with a low PBQS loading (2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The charge storage mechanism in the PBQS cathode involves solvated Zn2+ adsorption and consequent Zn2+ coordination with PBQS companied by de&#8208;solvation process, as confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis. However, sluggish Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation leads to a loss of Zn2+ coordination capacity when tested with higher PBQS loading (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) even at a low current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Remarkably, the addition of 2&#8201;% H2O to the DMF electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly facilitating the de&#8208;solvation process. As a result, the PBQS cathode (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) retains its Zn2+ storage capacity when using the modified electrolyte. This approach offers a new strategy for improving the rate performance of organic electrodes, complementing existing conductivity enhancements.

The single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether process offers both economic and technical advantages over the current two&#8208;step industrial synthesis. A highly active bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst is reported by Yuemin Wang, Silke Behrens et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202423273). Pd clusters/particles confined on the nanoparticulate ceria matrix feature abundant interfacial Pd2+ sites and adjacent O vacancies, accounting for the superior performance in both activity and stability.

In their Research Article (e202424391), Ayumi Ishii and co&#8208;workers present a giant bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in chiral polar crystals of helical 1D lead halide perovskites using chiral naphthylethylamine cations. The crystals, with a C2 space group, exhibit strong circular dichroism and an exceptional BPVE, achieving an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 15&#160;V&#8212;five times their band gap. These findings highlight the potential of chiral polar semiconductors for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic applications.

The cover artwork visualizes the dimeric N&#8208;heterotriangulene in front of a spiral staircase reflecting its helical chirality. The blue spheres represent the redox&#8208;active nitrogens, the connecting vibrant pathway symbolizes the charge transfer leading to a mixed&#8208;valence state enabled by the p&#8208;conjugated helicene backbone. The glowing orange helix illustrates the compound's ability to emit circularly polarized light, a property relevant to future chiroptical applications with low environmental impact.

The balance between the flexibility of the bipyridine&#8208;based diamine and the coordination domain's denticity drives the self&#8208;assembly of four distinct [Ag+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag+]&#8208;stabilized architectures, as reported by Bartosz Szyszko et al. in their Communication (e202423962). Using 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine leads to the formation of molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon links, while a 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde favors [2]catenanes and trefoil knot. The Frontispiece art accentuates the unique Solomon link architecture by depicting two interlocked, snake&#8208;like motifs that guard their cherished silver eggs.

Selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry has been seamlessly integrated with CuAAC. In their Research Article (e202500942), Wei Hou, Wei Zhou, Hongtao Xu et al. report a novel three&#8208;component reaction involving benzoselenazolones, alkynes, and azides. This reaction proceeds via a unique SeNEx&#8211;CuAAC tandem pathway, providing direct access to diverse 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles regioselectively with high atom economy. It was applied to successfully identify a potent Escherichia coli &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase inhibitor through target&#8208;based screening.

         <dc:description>
Under visible light, an enantioselective multicomponent reaction was achieved by exploiting natural enzyme diversity and biocompatible photochemistry.







Abstract
Despite remarkable advances in photoenzymatic methodologies, the development of photoenzymatic multicomponent reactions remains a significant challenge. In this Highlight, we showcase a recent breakthrough by Prof. Xiaoqiang Huang and co&#8208;workers, who achieved enantioselective triple&#8208;component radical sorting via visible light&#8208;induced biocatalysis under mild conditions. This innovative approach opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex molecules with high precision and efficiency, marking a remarkable advance in the field of enzymatic photocatalysis.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Two&#8208;Electron vs. Four&#8208;Electron Pathways</title>

The principles concerning the geometric size and chemical coordination of 2e&#8722; ORR catalysts were outlined to highlight the evolution of material design from 2e&#8722; ORR to 4e&#8722; ORR. Recent advances in atomically dispersed metal catalysts for 4e&#8722; ORR, including M&#8722;N&#8722;C coordination, light heteroatom doping, dual&#8208;metal coordination, and interactions with nanoparticles, were then thoroughly reviewed.







Abstract
Developing eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical devices for electrosynthesis, fuel cells (FCs), and metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) requires precisely designing the electronic pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process. Understanding the principle of developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and stable catalysts helps to reduce the usage of noble metals in ORR. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) emerge as promising alternatives to replace commercial noble metals due to their high utilization of active metal atoms, high intrinsic activity, and controllable coordination environments. In this review, the research tendency and reaction mechanisms in ORR are first summarized. The basic principles concerning the geometric size and chemical coordination of two&#8208;electron ORR (2e&#8722; ORR) catalysts were then discussed, aiming to outline the evolution of material design from 2e&#8722; ORR to four&#8208;electron ORR (4e&#8722; ORR). Subsequently, recent advances in ADMCs primarily investigated for the 4e&#8722; ORR are well&#8208;documented. These advances encompass studies on M&#8722;N&#8722;C coordination, light heteroatom doping, dual&#8208;metal atoms&#8208;based coordination, and interaction between nanoparticle (NPs)/nanoclusters (NCs) and atomically dispersed metals (ADMs). Finally, the setups for 2/4e&#8722; ORR applications, key challenges, and opportunities in the future design of ADMCs for the ORR are highlighted.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the basics of spin state theory and its key influencing factors, including crystal field, ligand environment, and valence changes. It further discusses how spin state affect peroxide activation by altering adsorption energy, energy barriers, and electron transfer, ultimately enhancing selective ROS generation for more sustainable peroxide&#8208;based oxidation applications.







Abstract
Peroxides are widely used in environmental applications due to their strong oxidizing properties, however, traditional activation methods often face challenges such as uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and high energy barriers. Recent advancements in spin state regulation provide a promising alternative to enhance the efficiency of peroxide activation. This review provides an overview of spin fundamentals and discusses the key factors affecting spin state in catalytic materials, including crystal field configuration, ligand environment, and valence changes. Subsequently, the role of electron spin state in peroxide activation is comprehensively analyzed, with a focus on how spin state regulation can tune adsorption energy, lower energy barriers, facilitate electron transfer between transition metals and peroxides, and promote selective ROS generation. Finally, this review briefly outlines the practical applications of peroxide activation in water treatment and concludes with a summary and perspectives on future research directions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of spin state regulation in advancing peroxide activation strategies.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;solid Fiber&#8208;shaped Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Fire Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;solid fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) with fire resistance were developed by incorporating an in&#8197;situ polymerized flame&#8208;retardant gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). Utilizing a dual mechanism of gas&#8208;phase radical scavenging and condensed&#8208;phase carbon formation, the GPE&#8208;based FLIBs exhibit no thermal runaway and maintain nonflammability under a range of abusive conditions.







Abstract
Flexible batteries such as scalable fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) hold great potential for powering wearable electronics due to their excellent electrochemical performance, flexibility, and weavability. However, the use of organic liquid electrolytes raises serious safety concerns, including leakage and combustion hazards. In this study, we develop fire&#8208;resistant lithium cobalt oxide/graphite FLIBs by employing an in&#8197;situ polymerized gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) incorporating 1,3,3,5,5&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) as a flame retardant and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as a crosslinker. This in&#8197;situ polymerization of GPE is well&#8208;suited for continuous FLIB production and enhances the electrolyte/electrode interface. The resulting GPE eliminates the inherent flammability of liquid electrolytes with zero self&#8208;extinguishing time, attributed to a dual flame&#8208;retardant mechanism: gas&#8208;phase free radical scavenging and condensed&#8208;phase carbon formation. Notably, the FLIBs using the flame&#8208;retardant GPEs demonstrate no thermal runaway and maintain nonflammability under various abusive conditions, including mechanical abuse (cutting or collision), electrical abuse (overcharging or overdischarging), and thermal abuse (overheating or fire hazards). Additionally, these FLIBs achieve excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles, and retain 99.4&#8201;% of capacity after 10,000 bending cycles, highlighting their outstanding durability. This work presents an effective and straightforward approach to greatly enhance the safety and practicality of FLIBs for wearable applications.

         <title>The Interplay Between Component Denticity and Flexibility Promotes the Formation of [AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI]&#8208;stabilised Links and Knots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between the diamine&#8216;s flexibility and the coordination domain&#8216;s denticity governed the self&#8208;assembly of four distinct [AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI]&#8208;stabilised architectures. Reactions with 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine produced molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link, while 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot. Selected assemblies showed interesting luminescent properties.







Abstract
A subtle interplay between the flexibility of the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;based diamine and the denticity of the coordination domain formed upon self&#8208;assembly enabled the formation of four distinct topologies stabilised by [Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag]2+ pairs. The reactions utilising 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine resulted in the formation of silver(I)&#8208;stabilised molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link. The 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot, demonstrating very close AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI distances. Two of the studied assemblies demonstrated interesting luminescent properties in the solid state.

&lt;p&gt;A subtle interplay between the flexibility of the 2,2&#8217;-bipyridyl-based diamine and the denticity of the coordination domain formed upon self-assembly enabled the formation of four distinct topologies stabilised by [Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pairs. The reactions utilising 2,6-diformylpyridine resulted in the formation of silver(I)-stabilised molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link. The 1,8-naphthyridine-based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot, demonstrating very close Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; distances. Two of the studied assemblies demonstrated interesting luminescent properties in the solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[C2N4H7O][NH2SO3]: High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Ditrigon Coupled Guanylurea Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on unit coupling strategy, a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) functional unit, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+), was proposed, and a novel KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like UV NLO crystal [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was designed and synthesized. This crystal achieves an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second harmonic generation response (6.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The Development of high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is critical in the field of optoelectronic functional crystals. High&#8208;performance NLO functional units are crucial for achieving desired target crystals. In this study, a promising group, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+, abbreviated as GU), was investigated using a unit coupling strategy. Furthermore, by modifying the KBe2BO3F2 template structure at the molecular level, the first metal&#8208;free guanylurea sulfamate [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was successfully synthesized. This crystal achieved an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.2&#215;KDP), and large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm). In addition, the remarkable phase&#8208;matching capability provides the potential for a fourth&#8208;harmonic generation (266&#8197;nm) in the Nd: YAG laser. Theoretical calculations indicated that GU and its favorable arrangement were primarily responsible for the large SHG effect and birefringence. Our study demonstrates that the GU group is promising for the development of UV NLO crystals.

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction Integrating Selenium(II)&#8211;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Chemistry and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4,5&#8208;Trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were synthesized regioselectively with high atom economy by seamlessly integrating selenium(II)&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry with CuAAC. This multicomponent reaction was applied to the successful identification of a potent Escherichia coli &#946;$\upbeta$&#8208;glucuronidase inhibitor through target&#8208;based screening. A mononuclear &#963;&#8208;bound copper(I)&#8208;acetylide complex was synthesized and used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.








Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tools for rapidly constructing compound libraries with sufficient molecular diversity and complexity. Herein, to fully leverage a third aspect of molecular diversity enabled by the selenium&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) reaction between alkynes and benzoselenazolones, a novel CuI&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction has been successfully developed. This reaction integrates SeNEx with CuAAC click chemistry, enabling rapid and regioselective synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high atom economy and good to excellent yields (65 examples, 50%&#8211;95%). Notably, this MCR demonstrates excellent functional group tolerance and features modular, predictable, robust, mild reaction conditions, and operational simplicity (air and water compatibility). Extensive mechanism studies have revealed that this reaction proceeds by a unique SeNEx&#8208;CuAAC tandem reaction pathway, distinguishing it from conventional copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click reactions. Importantly, a mononuclear &#963;&#8208;bound copper(I)&#8208;acetylide Cu1 was synthesized and confirmed to be an efficient catalyst for the SeNEx reaction. This discovery provides crucial mechanistic insights into the preferential reactivity of alkynyl groups toward SeNEx over CuAAC. Furthermore, preliminary biological activity screening identified compound 14 as a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli &#946;$\upbeta$&#8208;glucuronidase (EcGUS), with an IC50 value of 3.16 &#181;M. These findings underscore the significant potential of this MCR in synthetic chemistry, medical chemistry, and chemical biology.
