         <title>Changing the Reactivity of Zero&#8208; and Mono&#8208;Valent Germanium with a Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Bis(silylenyl)carborane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the chelating C,C&#8217;&#8208;bis(silylenyl)&#8208;ortho&#8208;dicarborane ligand, 1,2&#8208;(RSi)  2  &#8208;1,2&#8208;C  2  B  10  H  10  [R = PhC(NtBu)  2  ], leads to the monoatomic zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (&#8216;germylone&#8217;)  3  . The redox non&#8208;innocent character of the carborane scaffold has a drastic influence on the reactivity of  3  towards reductants and oxidants. Reduction of  3  with one molar equivalent of potassium naphthalenide (KC  10  H  8  ) causes facile oxidation of Ge  0  to Ge  I  along with a two&#8208;electron reduction of the C  2  B  10  cluster core and subsequent Ge  I  &#8208;Ge  I  coupling to form the dianionic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge  2  complex  4  . In contrast, oxidation of  3  with one molar equivalent of [Cp  2  Fe][B{C  6  H  3  (CF  3  )  2  }  4  ] as a one&#8208;electron oxidant furnishes the dicationic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge  2  complex  5  . The Ge  0  atom in  3  acts as donor towards GeCl  2  to form the trinuclear mixed&#8208;valent Ge  0  &#8208;&#8208;&gt;Ge  II  &lt;&#8208;&#8208;Ge  0  complex  6  , from which dechlorination with KC  10  H  8  affords the neutral Ge  2  complex  7  as a diradical species.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and mechanistic insights into C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus  Aspergillus fumigatus  however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulphur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulphurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8208;sulphur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified  A. fumigatus  strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme&#8208;mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryl&#8208;Acylcyclization between Enol Lactones and Organomagnesium Halides: Facile Synthesis of Indenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of rhenium&#8208;catalyzed aryl&#8208;acylcyclization between (hetero)arylmagnesium halides and enol lactones through a cascade Csp  2  &#8210;Csp  2  /Csp  2  &#8210;Csp  2  bond formation has been developed under mild reaction conditions. Indeed, a wide range of functional groups on both organomagnesium halides and enol lactones are well tolerated by the simple rhenium catalysis, thus furnishing polyfunctionalized indenones in one&#8208;pot fashion and with complete control of the regioselectivity. Moreover, this approach also provides a straightforward synthesis to neo&#8208;lignan and (  iso  )pauciflorol  F  . Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reaction involves a sequential of  syn  &#8208;carborhenation and intramolecular nucleophilic addition process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;range polariton&#8208;assisted energy transfer in organic microcavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;radiative energy transfer between spatially&#8208;separated molecules in a microcavity can occur when an excitonic state on both molecules are strongly&#8208;coupled to the same optical mode, forming so&#8208;called &#8216;hybrid&#8217; polaritons. Such energy transfer has previously been explored when thin&#8208;films of different molecules are relatively closely spaced (~100 nm). In this letter, we explore strong&#8208;coupled microcavities in which thin&#8208;films of two J&#8208;aggregated molecular dyes were separated by a spacer layer having a thickness of up to 2 &#956;m. Here, strong light&#8208;matter coupling and hybridisation between the excitonic transition is identified using white&#8208;light reflectivity and photoluminescence emission. We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8216;mesoscopic distances&#8217;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering in High Performance Ambipolar Emissive Mesopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesopolymers, with structural defects free, high solubility and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation of conjugated polymers, open a new avenue for organic optoelectronics. For example, organic light emitting transistors (OLETs) that integrate the functions of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) together, and are promising devices for next generation display technology and organic electrically pumped laser. However, in most cases, charge transport ability and light emitting strength are contradictory within one conjugated polymer. Therefore, the development of polymeric materials with high carrier mobility and light emitting ability becomes a key challenge. Herein, three low molecular weighted mesopolymers with thienopyrroledione&#8208;benzothiadiazole repeating units (meso&#8208;TBTF) were obtained by direct arylation polymerization of monomers. Resultant mesopolymers display strong solid state emission and high ambipolar carrier mobility, making them competitive candidates for light&#8208;emission devices. The molecular weights of meso&#8208;TBTF can be tuned by polymerization temperature, affording products with molecular weights of 3.8 kDa, 6.7 kDa, and 9.9 kDa for device characterization. All mesopolymers exhibit undetectable homo&#8208;coupling defects with gradiently&#8208;tunable energy levels and better electrical performance over the corresponding high molecular weight polymer. It is found that meso&#8208;TBTF with molecular weight of 6.7 kDa has the best electrical performance with an average mobility of 5.65 &#215; 10&#8208;3 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for electrons and 1.50 &#215; 10&#8208;2 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for holes, which are among the highest ambibipolar luminescent polymers. In summary, all mesopolymers have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of about 50% in solution and 10% in solid state. Polymer light emitting diodes of this material are fabricated to explore its potential use in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Anthracycline Utorubicin for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel anticancer compounds and their precision delivery systems are actively developed to create potent and well&#8208;tolerated anticancer therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel anthracycline, Utorubicin (UTO), and its preclinical development as an anticancer payload for nanocarriers. Free UTO was significantly more toxic to cultured tumor cell lines than the clinically used anthracycline, doxorubicin. Nanoformulated UTO, encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes, PS), reduced the viability of cultured malignant cells and this effect was potentiated by functionalization with a tumor&#8208;penetrating peptide (TPP). Systemic peptide&#8208;guided PS showed preferential accumulation in triple&#8208;negative breast tumor xenografts implanted in mice. At the same systemic UTO dose, the highest UTO accumulation in tumor tissue was seen for the TPP&#8208;targeted PS, followed by nontargeted PS, and free doxorubicin. Our study suggests potential applications for UTO in the treatment of malignant diseases and encourages further preclinical and clinical studies on UTO as a nanocarrier payload for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;valence compounds as polarizing agents for Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization in solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper we investigate a novel set of polarizing agents &#8208; mixed&#8208;valence compounds &#8208; by theoretical and experimental methods and demonstrate their performance in high&#8208;field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) NMR experiments in the solid state. Mixed&#8208;valence compounds constitute a group of molecules, in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, such polarizing agents can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP experiments in solid&#8208;state, with favorable conditions for dynamic nuclear polarization formation at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Hybrid Bi&#8208;microcompartments with Exocytosis&#8208;Inspired Behavior toward Fast Temperature&#8208;Modulated Transportation of living Organisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the unique characteristics of living cells, the creation of life&#8208;inspired functional ensembles is a rapidly expanding research topic, enabling transformative applications in various disciplines. Herein, we report a facile method for the fabrication of phospholipid and block copolymer hybrid bi&#8208;microcompartments via spontaneous asymmetric assembly at the water/tributyrin interface, whereby the temperature&#8208;mediated dewetting of the inner microcompartments allowed for exocytosis to occur in the constructed system. The exocytosis location and commencement time could be mediated by the buoyancy of the inner microcompartment and temperature, respectively. Furthermore, the constructed bi&#8208;microcompartments showed excellent biocompatibility and a universal loading capacity toward cargoes of widely ranging sizes; thus, the proliferation and temperature&#8208;programmed transportation of living organisms was achieved. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of complex mesoscale dynamic ensembles with life&#8208;inspired behaviors and provide a novel platform for on&#8208;demand transportation of various living organisms.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor biomarker&#8208;based theranostics has achieved broad interest and success in recent years. However, single biomarker&#8208;based recognition can cause false&#8208;positive feedback, including the on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor phenomenon by the absence of tumor&#8208;specific antigen. Besides, multi&#8208;biomarker&#8208;based recognition molecules often elicit nonspecific and undesired internalization when they bind to &#8216;&#8216;bystander&#8217;&#8217; cells. Herein, we report a universal DNA tetrahedral scaffold (DTS) that anchors on the cell membrane to load multiple aptamers and therapeutics for precise and effective theranostics. This DNA logic&#8208;gated nanorobot (DLGN) not only facilitates the precise discrimination among five cell lines, but also triggers the synergistic killing of effector aptamer&#8208;tethered synergistic drugs (EASDs) to target cancer cells. Logic&#8208;gated recognition integrated in aptamer&#8208;functionalized molecular machines will prompt fast tumor profiling,  in situ  capture and isolation, and safe delivery of precise medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Hole&#8208;Tunneling Heterojunction of Hematite&#8208;Based Photoanodes Accelerates Photosynthetic Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reported the rational design of single&#8208;atom metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (SMIS) heterojunctions based on earth&#8208;abundant Sn&#8208;doped hematite nanorods (SF NRs) for high&#8208;rate, efficient CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion and unveiled the details of dielectric field&#8208;assisted hole&#8208;tunneling dynamics at the SMIS heterojunctions. The results showed that the RuO  x  &#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe  2  O  3  photoanode (SMIS&#8208;3), which was prepared by a combined methodology of atomic deposition of 3.0 nm thick Al  2  O  3  overlayer with chemical grafting of atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  hole&#8208;collectors, gives an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of 52.0% under 370 nm light irradiation in 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer solution at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl, &gt;5&#8208;fold larger than that of the bare SF NRs photoanode. The characterization results clearly indicated that the dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al  2  O  3  /SF NRs interface. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber facilitates the fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  species, accelerating the O  2  &#8208;evolving reaction kinetics in the photoreaction compartment of PV&#8208;coupled artificial photosynthetic cells. Accordingly, a maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3 mmol&#8226;g  &#8208;1  &#8226;h  &#8208;1  was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO  2  &#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode, and an impressive overall quantum efficiency of 5.7% was recorded under 450 nm light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Strategy for CO2 Valorization Integrated with Organic Synthesis by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into solar fuels and/or fine chemicals is a promising way to enrich energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  However, the conventional reaction system for CO  2  photoreduction with pure H  2  O or sacrificial agents usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency, poor stability or cost&#8208;ineffective atom economy. Recent surge of integrating photocatalytic CO  2  valorization with selective organic synthesis into one reaction system indicates an efficient modus operandi that enables sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to  achieve the sustainable economic and social development goals. This paper reviews the current advances in cooperative photoredox reaction systems of integrating CO  2  valorization with organics upgrading based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The applications and virtues of this photoredox&#8208;based win&#8208;win coupling strategy, as well as the understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms are demonstrated. The ongoing challenges and prospects for further exploration of such versatile and efficient photoredox coupling reaction systems integrating CO  2  valorization with organic synthesis are critically discussed.</dc:description>

The&#160;  n  &#8208;butyl derivatives were also synthesized for the rare&#8208;earth elements scandium, lutetium, yttrium and lanthanum, covering the entire Ln(III) size range. Solvent&#8208;dependent extensive  &#160;n  &#8208;BuLi dissociation is revealed by&#160;  7  Li NMR spectroscopy, suggesting &#8220;Ce(  n&#8208;  Bu)  3  (thf)  x  &#8221; or solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs like &#8220;[Li(thf)  4  ][Ce(  n&#8208;  Bu)  4  (thf)  y  ]&#8221;&#160;as the dominant species of the&#160;  Imamoto&#160;  reagent. The stability of complexes Li  3  Ln(  n  &#8208;Bu)  6  (thf)  4  &#160;increases markedly with decreasing Ln(III) size.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymers for efficient Fluorocarbon&#8208;based Adsorption Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based&#8208;on atomistic defective models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for varying defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defective porous COPs are proven to be promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of meso&#8208;chiral interconversion in butterfly&#8208;shape overcrowded alkene rotor tunable by solvent properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over dynamic motion at the molecular level and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness are important issues for making nano&#8208;motors, nano&#8208;actuators or nano&#8208;sensors. Elucidation of dynamics of molecular rotational motion is an essential part and still challenging area of research. In this report, demonstration of reversible diastereomeric interconversion of a molecular rotor composed of overcrowded butterfly&#8208;shape alkene (  FDF  ) is given. Its inherent dual rotatory motion (two rotors, one stator) with interconversion between two diastereomers, chiral&#160;  trans  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;and meso&#160;  cis  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;forms, has been examined in detail upon varying temperatures and solvents. The free energy profile of 180 &#176; &#160;revolution of one rotor part has a bimodal shape with unevenly positioned maxima (i.e. transition states).&#160;  FDF  &#160;in aromatic solvents adopts preferentially meso&#160;  cis  &#8208;conformation, while in non&#8208;aromatic solvents a chiral&#160;  trans  &#8208;conformation is more abundant. Additionally, moderate correlations between the&#160;  trans  &#8208;  FDF  /  cis  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;ratio and solvent parameters, such as refractive index, polarizability, and viscosity were found. The results presented here have implementations in several fields of organic chemistry, such as design of artificial molecular machines, asymmetric/stereoselective reactions and solvent properties scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Kinetic and Spectroscopic Signatures of Copper Sites for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites of different topologies possess high activity in the direct conversion of methane to methanol via the chemical looping approach. Despite a large number of studies, identification of the active sites, and especially their intrinsic kinetic characteristics remain incomplete and ambiguous. In the present work, we collate the kinetic behavior of different copper species with their spectroscopic identities and track the evolution of various copper motifs during the reaction. Using time&#8208;resolved UV&#8208;vis and  in situ  EPR, XAS, and FTIR spectroscopies, two types of copper monomers were identified, one of which is active in the reaction with methane, in addition to a copper dimeric species with the mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo structure. Kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate of the copper monomers is somewhat slower than that of the dicopper mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo species, while the activation energy is two times lower.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Modular frameworks featuring well&#8208;defined pore structures in microscale domains establish tailor&#8208;made porous materials. For open molecular solids however, maintaining long&#8208;range order after desolvation is inherently challenging, since packing is usually governed by only a few supramolecular interactions. Here we report on two series of nanocubes obtained by co&#8208;condensation of two different hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacenes (TBTQs) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acids (BDBAs) with varying linear alkyl chains in 2,5&#8208;position.&#160;  n  Butyl groups at the apical position of the TBTQ vertices yielded soluble model compounds, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, methyl&#8208;substituted cages spontaneously crystallized as isostructural and highly porous solids with BET surface areas and pore volumes of up to 3426&#160;m  2  &#160;g  &#8722;1  &#160;and 1.82 cm  3  &#160;g  &#8722;1  . Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and sorption measurements revealed an intricate cubic arrangement of alternating micro&#8208; and mesopores in the range of 0.97&#8211;2.2&#160;nm that are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents at the BDBA linker.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of an enantiopure sub&#8208;monolayer of helicenes radical cations on Au(111) surface via non&#8208;covalent interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality and magnetism of molecules are two properties that in the last years raised notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine these functionalities, and their nanostructuration is the first step toward&#160; developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel assembling strategy to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate permitting the persistence of both the paramagnetic character and chirality of these molecules at the nanoscale. In&#8208;house characterizations demonstrated the retention of the chemical and paramagnetic properties after the deposition process. Furthermore, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Na9Bi5Os3O24: A&#160; Diamagnetic Oxide Featuring a Pronouncedly Jahn&#8208;Teller Compressed Octahedral Coordination of Osmium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) theorem constitutes one of the most fundamental and stringent concepts in chemistry. In transition elements chemistry, the 3  d  4  , 3  d  9  , and 3  d  7  configurations in octahedral complexes are particularly illustrative, where a distortion in local geometry is associated to a reduction of electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate about the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate. In contrast, for Na  9  Bi  5  Os  3  O  24  , the octahedron around Os  6+  (5  d  2  ) is heavily compressed, and the splitting of the  t  2g  set of 5  d  orbitals induced by this compression is extreme, such that a diamagnetic ground state results. Both these issues are extremely rare. The splitting into a lower  d  xy  (hosting two  d  electrons with opposite spin) and two higher  d  xz  and  d  yz  orbitals is so large that the Hund&#180;s coupling for  t  2g  electrons is overcome. These effects are not forced by structural constraints, the structure offers sufficient space for osmium to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide insights in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided Design of G Protein&#8208;coupled Receptor Polypharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many diseases are polygenic and can only be treated efficiently with drugs that modulate multiple targets. However, rational design of compounds with multi&#8208;target profiles is rarely pursued because it is considered too difficult, in particular if the drug must enter the CNS. Here, a structure&#8208;based strategy to identify dual&#8208;target ligands of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors is presented. We use this approach to design compounds that both antagonize the A2A adenosine receptor and activate the D2 dopamine receptor, which have excellent potential as antiparkinson drugs. Atomic resolution models of the receptors guided generation of a chemical library with compounds designed to occupy orthosteric and secondary binding pockets in both targets. Structure&#8208;based virtual screens identified ten compounds, of which three had affinity for both targets. One of these scaffolds was optimized to nanomolar dual&#8208;target activity and showed the predicted pharmacodynamic effect in a rat model of Parkinsonism.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can effectively facilitate carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) to produce multi&#8208;carbon products. However, the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ and the mechanistic understanding remain elusive. This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. Specifically, 20% Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8% C2H4 Faraday efficiency at &#8208;1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) during the 6 hours&#8208;test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism over Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs: The Cu0 site activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; while the Cu+ site strengthens the *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8208;C coupling. This paper provides an efficient strategy to rationally design Cu&#8208;based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO2ER.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise identification and characterization of catalytically active sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;alumina is one of the oldest and most important commercial catalytic materials with high surface area and stability. These attributes enabled its use as the first commercial large&#8208;scale heterogeneous catalyst for ethanol dehydration. Despite progress in materials characterization and over a hundred years of active research, the nature of the specific sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina which are responsible for its unique catalytic properties has remained obscure and controversial. Using combined infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements we identify the octahedral, amphoteric (O)  5  Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites on the (100) segments of massively restructured (110) facets on typical rhombus&#8208;platelet &#947;&#8208;alumina as well as the (100) segments of irrational surfaces (invariably always present in all &#947;&#8208;alumina samples) responsible for its unique catalytic activity. Such (O)  5  Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites are also present on the macroscopically defined (100) facets of &#947;&#8208;alumina with elongated/rod&#8208;like geometry. The exact mechanism by which these sites lose &#8208;OH groups upon thermal dehydroxylation resulting in coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al  +3  O  5  sites is clarified. These coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al sites demonstrate new chemistry, producing well&#8208;defined thermally stable Al&#8208;carbonyl complexes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the nature of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina and their role as catalytically active sites.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a tumor&#8211;targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy enabled by aptamer&#8211;drug conjugate nanomicelles is reported to boost antitumor immune responses. Aptamer&#8211;multivalent&#8211;drug conjugate (ApMDC), an amphiphilic telodendrimer consisting of a hydrophilic aptamer and a hydrophobic monodendron anchored with four anticancer drugs by acid&#8211;labile linkers, is designed and synthesized. By co&#8211;self&#8211;assembly with an ApMDC analogue, in which aptamer is replaced with polyethylene glycol, surface aptamer density of these nanomicelles can be screened to reach an optimal complementation between blood circulation and tumor&#8211;targeting ability. Optimized nanomicelles can enhance immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which strikingly augments tumor&#8211;specific immune responses of checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent tumor&#8211;bearing mice. ApMDC nanomicelles represent a robust platform for structure&#8211;function optimization of drug conjugates and nanomedicines, suggesting an alternative to improve antitumor efficacy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence and phosphorescence are known as two kinds of fundamental optical signals, which have been used for myriad applications. Of particular note, simultaneous activation of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in aqueous phase remains a big challenge up to present. Herein, we prepare a kind of zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) with fluorescence and RTP properties through a facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy. For the as&#8208;prepared Zn@SiNSs, the recombination of electrons and holes in defects and defect&#8208;stabilized excitons derived from oxygen vacancy/C=N bonds lead to the production of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived RTP (emission lasting for ~9 s, quantum yield (QY): ~33.6%, RTP lifetime: ~236 ms). In addition, the internal Si&#8208;O bonded networks and hydrophilic surface in Zn@SiNSs can reduce nonradiative decay to form self&#8208;protective RTP, and also provide high water solubility, excellent pH&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8722;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The employment of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect within lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom&#8208;utilization possess competitive advantages to serve as both anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. However, it&#8217;s still a great challenge due to the insufficiency of facile synthetic strategy and ambiguity of the structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6 wt% is first proposed via a self&#8208;template and self&#8208;reduction strategy. The special local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity evidenced by combination of experimental and theoretical studies. Impressively, LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000 cycles and ultrahigh rate capability. Moreover, it indicates high areal capacity of 6.24 mAh cm&#8722;2  with robust cycling life at a high sulfur mass loading of 8.3 mg cm&#8722;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Absolute Quantification of Drug&#8208;Vector Delivery to the Cytosol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macromolecular drugs inefficiently cross membranes to reach their cytosolic targets. They require drug delivery vectors to facilitate their translocation across the plasma membrane or escape from endosomes. Optimization of these vectors has however been hindered by the difficulty to accurately measure cytosolic arrival. We have developed an exceptionally sensitive and robust assay for the relative or absolute quantification of this step. The assay is based on benzylguanine and biotin modifications on a drug delivery vector of interest, which allow respectively for selective covalent capture in the cytosol with a SNAP&#8208;tag fusion protein and for quantification at picomolar sensitivity. The assay was validated by determining the absolute numbers of cytosolic molecules for two drug delivery vectors: The B&#8208;subunit of Shiga toxin and the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide TAT. We expect this assay to favour delivery vector optimization and the understanding of the enigmatic translocation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Organic Phosphor Sensitization Based Highly Efficient Electrofluorescence Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are considered as potential candidates for replacing precious metal&#8208;based complexes to fabricate highly efficient organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). However, applications of the reported RTP materials in OLEDs are seriously impeded by their low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in thin film state. To overcome these obstacles, we established a new strategy to construct highly efficient OLEDs based on pure organic RTP material sensitized fluorescence emitter by selecting benzimidazole&#8208;triazine molecules (PIM&#8208;TRZ), 2,6&#8208;di(phenothiazinyl)naphthalene (&#946;&#8208;DPTZN) and 5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) as host, phosphor sensitizer and fluorescent emitter, respectively. The perfect combination of host, phosphorescent sensitizer and fluorescent emitter in the emitting layer ensure the outstanding performance of the devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.7%, which sheds light on a new avenue for the construction of cost&#8208;effective high&#8208;performance OLEDs based on classic fluorescence emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxycarbonylation of Terminal Alkenes: Efficient Access to &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Alkylcarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective oxycarbonyl&#8208;ation of alkenes has been established herein. The ligand with an ethyl group at the C&#8208;6 position of Pyox plays a significant role in the intermolecular oxypalladation process, leading to high reactivity and excellent enantioselective control. Compared to the conventional methods, the reaction itself features alkenes as easily prepared starting materials, mild and operationally simple reaction conditions, and insensitivities to air and water. Moreover, this method allows for broad alkene substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivities, scalabilities and a wide array of applications, and provides a useful route for the convenient and straightforward synthesis of chiral  &#946;  &#8208;hydroxy alkylcarboxylic acids/esters.</dc:description>

Herein we report a general, safe, and high&#8208;yielding strategy to access cyclic diaryl&#160; l 3 &#8208; bromanes. These unique compounds feature appealing and complementary reactivity to&#160; l 3 &#8208;iodanes, generating arynes under mild reaction conditions and in a presence of a weak base. Accordingly, formal&#160; meta &#8208;selective transition metal&#8208;free C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N couplings may be achieved.

         <title>Rotaxane CoII Complexes as Field&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Ion Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically chelating ligands have untapped potential for the engineering of metal ion properties by providing reliable control of the number, nature and geometry of donor atoms, akin to how a protein cavity controls the properties of bound metal ions. Here we demonstrate this principle in the context of Co  II  &#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets. Using multi&#8208;frequency EPR, susceptibility and magnetization measurements we found that these complexes show some of the highest zero field splittings reported for five&#8208;coordinate Co  II  complexes to date. The predictable coordination behavior of the interlocked ligands allowed the magnetic properties of their Co  II  complexes to be evaluated computationally  a priori  and our combined experimental and theoretical approach enabled us to rationalize the observed trends. The predictable magnetic behavior of the rotaxane Co  II  complexes demonstrates that interlocked ligands offer a new strategy to design metal complexes with interesting functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl or Mono&#8208;carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes via the decomposition of diazo compounds is a powerful and straightforward strategy to produce cyclopropanes. However, the potentially explosive nature of the diazo substrates tempers the appeal of further application of this strategy. Herein we report the first Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecifically deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction of the readily available and bench stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, in which one of the two carbonyl groups acts as a carbene equivalent upon deoxygenation, thus engaging in the subsequent cyclopropanation process. With a commercially available molybdenum catalyst, an array of valuable cyclopropanes were obtained in up to 90% yield and exclusive regioselectivity. The synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and application to the cyclopropanation of a simple mono&#8208;carbonyl compound. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that phosphine (or silane) is both a mild reductant and a good oxygen acceptor that could efficiently regenerate the catalytically active Mo&#8208;catalyst through reduction of the Mo&#8208;oxo complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free, Base&#8208;Promoted 1,2&#8208;Additions of Polyfluorophenylboronates to Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel protocol for the transition metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluoroaryl boronate esters to aldehydes and ketones is reported, which provides secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, and ketones. Control experiments and DFT calculations indicate that both the ortho&#8208;F substituents on the polyfluorophenyl boronates and the counterion K+ in the carbonate base are critical. The distinguishing features of this procedure include the employment of commercially available starting materials and the broad scope of the reaction with a wide variety of carbonyl compounds giving moderate to excellent yields. Intriguing structural features involving O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonding, as well as arene&#8208;perfluoroarene interactions, in this series of racemic polyfluoroaryl carbinols have also been addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Ni&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling via Kinetic Resolution Enabled by a Bulky yet Flexible, Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling has revolutionized the construction of amines. Despite the innovations of multiple generations of ligands to modulate the reactivity of the metal center, ligands for the low&#8208;temperature enantioselective amination of aryl halides remain a coveted target of catalyst engineering. Designs that promote one elementary reaction often create bottlenecks at other steps. We here report an unprecedented low&#8208;temperature (as low as &#8208;50 &#8451;), enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides with sterically hindered secondary amines via a kinetic resolution process (s factor up to &gt;300). A bulky yet flexible chiral  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand is leveraged to drive both oxidative addition and reductive elimination with low barriers and control the enantioselectivity. Computational studies indicate that the rotations of multiple sigma&#8208;bonds on the C  2  &#8208;symmetric chiral ligand adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes. We expect this design would be widely applicable to diverse transition states to achieve other challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Reagent Modulation and Remote Anchimeric Assistance for Glycosylation: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Glycans up to a 30&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging reagent modulation and a 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl remote anchimeric assistance glycosylation strategy has been developed to achieve the first highly stereoselective synthesis of the branched Dendrobium Huoshanense glycans with the immunostimulating activities and the linear Longan glycans containing up to 30 contiguous 1,2&#8208;cis glucosidic bonds with anti&#8208;cancer activities.







Abstract
The efficient synthesis of long, branched, and complex carbohydrates containing multiple 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic linkages is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a merging reagent modulation and 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl remote anchimeric assistance glycosylation strategy, which is successfully applied to the first highly stereoselective synthesis of the branched Dendrobium Huoshanense glycans and the linear Longan glycans containing up to 30 contiguous 1,2&#8208;cis glucosidic bonds. DFT calculations shed light on the origin of the much higher stereoselectivities of 1,2&#8208;cis glucosylation with 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl group than 6&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl or 6&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl groups. Orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates has been demonstrated in the efficient synthesis of complex glycans, precluding such issues as aglycon transfer inherent to orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis based on thioglycosides.

         <title>Construction of Flexible Amine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by Catalysis and Reduction of Formic Acid via the Eschweiler&#8211;Clarke Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the Eschweiler&#8211;Clarke reaction, a series of flexible amine&#8208;linked COFs was synthesized by catalysis and reduction of formic acid. The unique bifunctional properties of formic acid can not only catalyze the formation of rigid C=N bond like acetic acid, the most common catalyst in COF synthesis, but also reduce and transform it to flexible C&#8722;N bond simultaneously, giving COFs the accommodative adaptability to guest molecules.







Abstract
Compared to the current mainstream rigid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by imine bonds, flexible COFs have certain advantages of elasticity and self&#8208;adaptability, but their construction and application are greatly limited by the complexity in synthesis and difficulty in obtaining regular structure. Herein, we reported for the first time a series of flexible amine&#8208;linked COFs with high crystallinity synthesized by formic acid with unique catalytic and reductive bifunctional properties, rather than acetic acid, the most common catalyst for COF synthesis. The reaction mechanism was demonstrated to be a synchronous in situ reduction during the formation of imine bond. The flexibilities of the products endow them with accommodative adaptability to guest molecules, thus increasing the adsorption capacities for nitrogen and iodine by 27&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively. Impressively, a novel concept of flexibilization degree was proposed firstly, which provides an effective approach to rationally measure the flexibility of COFs.

The flexibilities of the products endow them with accommodative adaptability to guest molecules, thus increasing the adsorption capacities for nitrogen and iodine by 27&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively. Impressively, a novel concept of flexibilization degree was proposed firstly, which provides an effective approach to rationally measure the flexibility of COFs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Turn&#8208;On Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Purely Organic Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of force&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on persistent RTP luminogen named Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F is reported. The abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is attributed to the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group. This material was successfully applied in thermal printing and stylus printing.







Abstract
Research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has been a hot topic, especially for those with stimulus response character. Herein, an abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is reported, in which, purely organic luminogen of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F shows turn&#8208;on persistent phosphorescence under grinding. Careful analyses of experimental results, coupled with the theoretical calculations, show that the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group should be mainly responsible for this exciting result. Furthermore, the applications of stylus printing and thermal printing are both successfully realized, based on the unique RTP effect of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F.

         <title>Reversed Active Sites Boost the Intrinsic Activity of Graphene&#8208;like Cobalt Selenide for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;like Co0.85Se was doped with sulfur, bringing about a reversal in active sites for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from cationic cobalt sites to anionic sulfur sites. A consequent change in the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of the active sites improved the overpotential of the HER.







Abstract
Optimizing the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of active sites is essential to improve the overpotential of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We doped graphene&#8208;like Co0.85Se with sulfur and found that the active sites are reversed (from cationic Co sites to anionic S sites), which contributed to an enhancement in electrocatalytic HER performance. The optimal S&#8208;doped Co0.85Se composite has an overpotential of 108&#8197;mV (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a Tafel slope of 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, which exceeds other reported Co0.85Se&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The doped S sites have much higher activity than the Co sites, with a hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) close to zero (0.067&#8197;eV), which reduces the reaction barrier for hydrogen production. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the intrinsic HER activity of other related transition metal chalcogenides.

         <title>A Ge/Carbon Atomic&#8208;Scale Hybrid Anode Material: A Micro&#8211;Nano Gradient Porous Structure with High Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500&#8201;&#176;C), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom&#8208;level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The continuous growth of the solid&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI) and material crushing are the fundamental issues that hinder the application of Ge anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Solving Ge deformation crushing during discharge/charge cycles is challenging using conventional carbon coating modification methods. Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500&#8201;&#176;C), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom&#8208;level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity is maintained at 1127&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles (2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;71&#8197;cycles), 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (72&#8211;1000&#8197;cycles)) with a retention of 84&#8201;% compared to the second cycle. The thickness of the SEI is only 17.4&#8197;nm after 1000&#8197;cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance and stable SEI fully reflect the application potential of this material.

         <title>Atomically Precise Engineering of Single&#8208;Molecule Stereoelectronic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control of the dihedral angle and the rotation processes of phenyl rings of a prototype terphenyl molecule can be achieved by introducing a photochromic molecule, azobenzene, as the side chain. The experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that the structure of the side chain can alter the twisted angel of adjacent phenyl rings, as well as the rotation barrier, because of the variable steric hindrance of the azobenzene group.







Abstract
Charge transport in a single&#8208;molecule junction is extraordinarily sensitive to both the internal electronic structure of a molecule and its microscopic environment. Two distinct conductance states of a prototype terphenyl molecule are observed, which correspond to the bistability of outer phenyl rings at each end. An azobenzene unit is intentionally introduced through atomically precise side&#8208;functionalization at the central ring of the terphenyl, which is reversibly isomerized between trans and cis forms by either electric or optical stimuli. Both experiment and theory demonstrate that the azobenzene side&#8208;group delicately modulates charge transport in the backbone via a single&#8208;molecule stereoelectronic effect. We reveal that the dihedral angle between the central and outer phenyl ring, as well as the corresponding rotation barrier, is subtly controlled by isomerization, while the behaviors of the phenyl ring away from the azobenzene are hardly affected. This tunability offers a new route to precisely engineer multiconfigurational single&#8208;molecule memories, switches, and sensors.

A strategic implementation of indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units into polycyclic heteroaromatics is proposed, making use of not only the multi&#8208;resonance for narrowband emission but also the enhanced electronic coupling of para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms to narrow energy gaps. The corresponding emitters show narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminance and high efficiencies when assisted by a sensitizer with thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) organic emitters bearing small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) are of general interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICz) embedded MR&#8208;fluorophors have demonstrated extremely small FWHMs, yet in the violet region with low electroluminescence efficiency. Herein, a strategic implementation of ICz subunits into MR fluorophors is proposed by taking advantage of the synergetic effect of para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms to enhance electronic coupling to decrease emitting energy gap. Deep blue emitters peaking at 441 and 447&#8197;nm with FWHMs of only 18 and 21&#8197;nm are thereof obtained, respectively, accompanied by &#8776;90&#8201;% photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields. With the assistance of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer to recycle excitons, the corresponding narrowband electroluminescent devices show unprecedent high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.0&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with CIEy of 0.10 and 0.085, respectively.

         <title>Integrating a Concentration Gradient Generator and a Single&#8208;Cell Trapper Array for High&#8208;Throughput Screening the Bioeffects of Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated microfluidic platform combining a concentration gradient generator (CGG) module with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) module has been designed for generating gradient concentrations of nanoparticles and evaluating the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of nanoparticles on mammalian cells.







Abstract
We herein develop a concentration gradient generator (CGG) on a microfluidic chip for diluting different nanoparticles. Specifically designed compact disk (CD)&#8208;shaped microchannels in the CGG module could thoroughly mix the flowing solutions and generate a linear concentration gradient of nanoparticles without aggregation. We combine the CGG with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) on microfluidics to evaluate the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of the nanoparticles. The precise control of the spatiotemporal generation of nanoparticle concentration on the CGG module and the single&#8208;cell&#8208;level monitoring of the cell behaviors on the SCA module by a high&#8208;content system in real time, render the CGG&#8208;SCA system a highly precise platform, which can exclude the average effect of cell population and reflect the response of individual cells to the gradient concentrations accurately. In addition, the CGG&#8208;SCA system provides an automated platform for high&#8208;throughput screening of nanomedicines with high precision and low sample consumption.

         <title>Engineering Bismuth&#8211;Tin Interface in Bimetallic Aerogel with a 3D Porous Structure for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuth&#8211;Tin aerogel was prepared at ambient temperature, resulting in a three&#8208;dimensional porous nanostructure with abundant pores. The material presents excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for formic acid generation with a high Faradaic efficiency (93.9&#8201;%) and partial current density of 9.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into valuable hydrocarbons is appealing in alleviating the excessive CO2 level. We present the very first utilization of metallic bismuth&#8211;tin (Bi&#8208;Sn) aerogel for CO2RR with selective HCOOH production. A non&#8208;precious bimetallic aerogel of Bi&#8208;Sn is readily prepared at ambient temperature, which exhibits 3D morphology with interconnected channels, abundant interfaces and a hydrophilic surface. Superior to Bi and Sn, the Bi&#8208;Sn aerogel exposes more active sites and it has favorable mass transfer properties, which endow it with a high FEHCOOH of 93.9&#8201;%. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;Sn aerogel achieves a FEHCOOH of ca. 90&#8201;% that was maintained for 10&#8197;h in a flow battery. In&#8197;situ ATR&#8208;FTIR measurements confirmed that the formation of *HCOO is the rate&#8208;determining step toward formic acid generation. DFT demonstrated the coexistence of Bi and Sn optimized the energy barrier for the production of HCOOH, thereby improving the catalytic activity.

         <title>Truly Monodisperse Molecular Nanoparticles of Cerium Dioxide of 2.4&#8197;nm dimensions: A {Ce100O167} Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up molecular approach yields a giant Ce/O cluster with a 2.4&#8197;nm {Ce100O167} core within a monolayer shell of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands. The crystal structure shows it has the fluorite structure of bulk CeO2 and it is thus an ultra&#8208;small piece of CeO2 in molecular form (a molecular nanoparticle) providing structural information to atomic resolution of surface features important to catalysis by CeO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles of CeO2 obtained in molecular form, so&#8208;called molecular nanoparticles, have been limited to date to a family whose largest member is of nuclearity Ce40 with a {Ce40O58} core atom count. Herein we report that a synthetic procedure has been developed to the cation [Ce100O149(OH)18(O2CPh)60(PhCO2H)12(H2O)20]16+, a member with a much higher Ce100 nuclearity and a {Ce100O167} core that is more akin to the smallest ceria nanoparticles. Its crystal structure reveals it to possess a 2.4&#8197;nm size and high D2d symmetry, and it has also allowed identification of core surface features including facet composition, the presence and location of Ce3+and H+ (i.e. HO&#8722;) ions, and the binding modes of the ligand monolayer of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands.

         <title>Phthalocyanine as a Bioinspired Model for Chlorophyll f&#8208;Containing Photosystem&#8197;II Drives Photosynthesis into the Far&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorophyll f (Chl&#8201;f)&#8208;containing Photosystem II absorbing in the far red has transgressed the red limit of photosynthesis locked by chlorophyll&#8201;a at 680 nm and drives water oxidation at 727&#8197;nm. Phthalocyanine chromophore with similar absorption properties as Chl f was stitched to a model of tyrosineZ/histidine, the pair of amino acids that acts as electron relay between the Chl&#8201;f and the Mn4Ca water oxidizing complex.

&lt;p&gt;Chlorophyll &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; (Chl&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;containing Photosystem II absorbing in the far red has transgressed the red limit of photosynthesis locked by chlorophyll&#8201;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; at 680 nm and drives water oxidation at 727&#8197;nm. Phthalocyanine chromophore with similar absorption properties as Chl &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; was stitched to a model of tyrosine&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;/histidine, the pair of amino acids that acts as electron relay between the Chl&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; and the Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ca water oxidizing complex.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel peptide coupling method relies on sun&#8208;light activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex for the in&#8208;situ generation of a novel coupling reagent. As demonstrated by Yoav Eichen, Alex&#8197;M. Szpilman et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011510), the method is rapid, water&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;tolerant and compatible with all common amino acids and protective groups. It is characterized by a significantly reduced environmental, energetical and economic footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions.

         <title>Controlling Oxygen Reduction Selectivity through Steric Effects: Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron and Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction with Cobalt Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction through tuning of molecular steric effects is demonstrated by Ran Long, Rui Cao et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102523). Selective two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron oxygen reductions can be achieved by using Co porphyrin atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. This work represents an unparalleled example to improve oxygen reduction selectivity by tuning only steric effects of catalysts without changing molecular and electronic structures.

         <title>Lignin Compounds to Monoaromatics: Selective Cleavage of C&#8722;O Bonds over a Brominated Ruthenium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brominated supported Ru catalyst was developed for the cleavage of C&#8722;O linkages in aryl ethers (reaching yield 90.3&#8201;% to monoaromatics from diphenyl ether) in lignin compounds without hydrogenation of the aromatic rings. Both selective poisoning of terrace sites and electronic promotion of defect sites contribute to the catalytic performance.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O linkages in aryl ethers in biomass&#8208;derived lignin compounds without hydrogenation of the aromatic rings is a major challenge for the production of sustainable mono&#8208;aromatics. Conventional strategies over the heterogeneous metal catalysts require the addition of homogeneous base additives causing environmental problems. Herein, we propose a heterogeneous Ru/C catalyst modified by Br atoms for the selective direct cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds in diphenyl ether without hydrogenation of aromatic rings reaching the yield of benzene and phenol as high as 90.3&#8201;% and increased selectivity to mono&#8208;aromatics (97.3 vs. 46.2&#8201;% for initial Ru) during depolymerization of lignin. Characterization of the catalyst indicates selective poisoning by Br of terrace sites over Ru nanoparticles, which are active in the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, while the defect sites on the edges and corners remain available and provide higher intrinsic activity in the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Functionalized High Mannose&#8208;Specific Lectins for the Discovery of Type&#8197;I Mannosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lectins that can be applied to specifically detect high mannose N&#8208;glycans on cell surfaces have been prepared by engineering the C&#8208;terminus of a naturally occur cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue. The functionalized lectins can be utilized to aid type&#8197;I &#945; 1,2&#8208;mannosidase inhibitor discovery and development. The functionalized lectin is used to prepare kifunensine analogues that are &gt;75&#8208;fold more potent than kifunensine.







Abstract
An engineered cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue that exhibits specificity for high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been constructed to aid type&#8197;I &#945; 1,2&#8208;mannosidase inhibitor discovery and development. Engineering the lectins C&#8208;terminus permitted facile functionalization with fluorophores via a sortase and click strategy. The resulting lectin constructs exhibit specificity for cells presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Importantly, these lectin constructs can also be applied to specifically assess changes in cell surface glycosylation induced by type&#8197;I mannosidase inhibitors. Testing the utility of these lectin constructs led to the discovery of type&#8197;I mannosidase inhibitors with nanomolar potency. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the specificity and utility of the functionalized cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue constructs, and highlight their potential in analytical contexts that require high mannose&#8208;specific lectins.

         <title>Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes for Early Endosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unidirectional penetration along minimalist pH gradients is developed as a strategy to label the membrane of early endosomes with mechanosensitive flipper probes, by simple addition to unmodified cells. Substituted benzylamines offer the right acidity, pKa=10, not too strong to allow reversibility, not too weak to inhibit penetration from neutral water in the cytosol, and, perhaps, extra returns from interfacial aromatic anchoring.







Abstract
Fluorescent flipper probes have been introduced recently to image membrane tension in live cells, and strategies to target these probes to specific membranes are emerging. In this context, early endosome (EE) targeting without the use of protein engineering is especially appealing because it translates into a fascinating transport problem. Weakly basic probes, commonly used to track the inside of acidic late endosomes and lysosomes, are poorly retained in EE because they are sufficiently neutralized in weakly acidic EE, thus able to diffuse out. Here, we disclose a rational strategy to target EE using a substituted benzylamine with a higher pKa value as a head group of the flipper probe. The resulting EE flippers are validated for preserved mechanosensitivity, ready for use in biology, particularly to elucidate the mechanics of endocytosis.

         <title>A Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Encapsulated with DNAzyme for Intracellular Drug Synthesis and Self&#8208;Sufficient Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic therapy nanoplatform was developed by encapsulating the therapeutic DNAzyme into Cu/Zn bimetallic MOF for intracellular drug synthesis and self&#8208;sufficient gene therapy. This design can not only ably avoids the side effects of traditional chemotherapy, but also effectively inhibit tumor metastasis by cleaving the oncogene substrate.







Abstract
Although chemotherapy is one of the most widely used cancer treatments, there are serious side effects, drug resistance, and secondary metastasis. To address these problems, herein we designed a bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) encapsulated with DNAzyme for co&#8208;triggered in situ cancer drug synthesis and DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Once in cancer cells, MOFs would disassemble and liberate copper ions, zinc ions, and DNAzyme under the acidic environment of lysosomes. Copper ions can catalyze the synthesis of the chemotherapeutic drug through copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction after being reduced to CuI; zinc ions act as the cofactor to activate the cleavage activity of DNAzyme. The anticancer drug is synthesized intracellularly and can kill cancer cells on site to minimize side effects to normal organisms. The activated DNAzyme starts gene therapy to inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis by targeting and cleaving oncogene substrates.

         <title>Prediction of Novel van der Waals Boron Oxides with Superior Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10791-10797, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring boron oxide (18MR&#8208;B2O3) is predicted with 1:1 ratio of [BO3] triangles and [B3O6] boroxol rings. Its van der Waals stackings, AA and AB, satisfy all the stringent criteria for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials, exhibiting short second harmonic generation (SHG) phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and large SHG response.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials are attracting increasing attention because of their structural diversity and complexity. Using the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystal structure prediction method combined with the first&#8208;principles calculations, here we propose layered 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (18MR) boron oxide B2O3 polymorphs as high&#8208;performance NLO materials. 18MR&#8208;B2O3 with the AA and AB stackings are potential DUV NLO materials. The superior performing 18MR&#8208;B2O3AB has an unprecedentedly high second harmonic generation coefficient of 1.63&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, the largest among the DUV NLO materials, three times larger than that of the advanced DUV NLO material KBe2BO3F2 and comparable to that of &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4. Its unusually large birefringence of 0.196 at 400&#8197;nm guarantees the phase&#8208;matching wavelength &#955;PM to reach this material's extreme absorption edge of &#8776;154&#8197;nm.

         <title>Cage&#8208;Like Porous Materials with Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Excellent C2H2/CO2 Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10828-10832, May 3, 2021. </description>

Cage&#8208;like FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) series all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance, which may overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based separation is an important technology for C2H2 purification due to the environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;efficient advantage. In addition to the high selectivity of C2H2/CO2, the high uptake of C2H2 also plays an important role in the separation progress. However, the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation performance is still in a dilemma. Herein, we report a series of cage&#8208;like porous materials named FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;R (R=Me, Et, nPr and iPr) which all have high C2H2 uptakes at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K. Dynamic breakthrough studies show that they all exhibit excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance. Particularly, FJI&#8208;H8&#8208;Me possesses a long breakthrough time up to 90&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that the suitable pore space and geometry contribute much to the excellent separation performance.

         <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10888-10894, May 3, 2021. </description>

CO oxidation taking place under a 2D microporous silicon dioxide film demonstrates a &#8764;12&#8201;% enhancement in CO2 production by creating an interfacial microenvironment that fosters a higher coverage of reactive Pd surface oxide sites that are integral to CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8211;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using in situ IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO2 formation rates than Pd alone.

2D homochiral lead&#8208;iodide perovskites were constructed by the introduction of a chiral center. The perovskites exhibit coexisting ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism, offering great application prospects for next&#8208;generation smart devices.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites have emerged as a significant class of materials showing promising optoelectronic and spintronic applications. Reports of chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, however, have been scarce. In this work, we have successfully synthesized homochiral lead&#8211;iodide perovskite ferroelectrics [(R)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 by introducing a methyl group into the organic cation of the parent (N&#8208;benzylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium)PbI4. Vibrational circular dichroism spectra identify the chiral mirroring relationship. They both undergo 222F2&#8208;type paraelectric&#8211;ferroelectric behavior at around 378&#8197;K coupled with clear ferroelastic domain &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching. Besides, they exhibit an evident thermochromism with color change from orange&#8211;yellow to orange&#8211;red. To our knowledge, the discovery of integrated ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism in chiral perovskites is unprecedented.

         <title>Multinuclear Ag Clusters Sandwiched by Pt Complex Units: Fluxional Behavior and Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cluster Photoluminescence</title>

New types of multinuclear sandwich complexes consisting of an Ag3 core and Pt complex units are reported. The first observation of CD and CPL properties from a multinuclear sandwich complex was achieved after optical resolution using a chiral anion.







Abstract
Multinuclear Ag clusters sandwiched by Pt complex units were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR studies. The sandwich&#8208;shaped multinuclear Ag complexes showed two different types of fluxional behavior in solution: rapid slippage of Pt complex units on the Ag3 core and a reversible demetalation&#8211;metalation reaction by the treatment with Cl anion and Ag ion, respectively. The Ag2 complex obtained by demetalation reaction from the Ag3 complex displayed U to Z isomerization. These multinuclear Ag complexes showed strong photoluminescence whose properties depended on the existence of Pt&#8594;Ag dative bonds. The Ag3 complex, identified to be &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cluster&#8221;, was optically resolved by the formation of a diastereomeric salt with a chiral anion. The enantiomers show circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties which is unprecedented for compounds based on a chiral sandwich structure. Theoretical calculations allow to understand their structural features and photophysical properties.

         <title>A Balance Between Capture and Release: How Nanochaperones Regulate Refolding of Thermally Denatured Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10865-10870, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two working mechanisms of nanochaperones in regulating the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme were fully deciphered. The balance between the capture and release of client proteins that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating the refolding of denatured proteins, regardless of the ATP&#8208;independent or ATP&#8208;dependent chaperones.







Abstract
Nanochaperones have been designed and used for regulating the (re)folding of proteins, treating protein misfolding&#8208;related diseases, and, more recently, in drug delivery. Despite various successes, a complete understanding of the working mechanisms remains elusive, which represents a challenge for the realization of their full potential. Here, we thoroughly investigated the functioning of differently charged nanochaperones that regulate the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme. We found that the balance between the capture and release of lysozyme clients that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating refolding. More importantly, the findings could be applied to other enzymes with various physicochemical properties. On the basis of these results, we could recover the activity of enzymes with high efficiency either after 20&#8197;days of storage at 40&#8201;&#176;C or heating at high temperatures for 30&#8211;60&#8197;min. Our results provide important new design strategies for nanochaperone systems to improve their properties and expand their applications.

         <title>Metal Sub&#8208;nanoclusters Confined within Hierarchical Porous Carbons with High Oxidation Activity</title>

A novel and versatile strategy has been developed for the synthesis of bimetal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). The sizes of the homogeneous&#8208;dispersion Cu&#8208;M SNCs (M=Pd, Pt, or Ru) are mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm even at high loadings up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;M@HPC catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the selective oxidation of furfural to maleic acid under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) have shown great promise for a variety of catalytic reactions. However, the fabrication of stable metal SNCs simultaneously with high dispersion and high metal contents remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel and versatile strategy for the synthesis of various bimetal SNCs stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). This facile synthesis only involves the self&#8208;assembly of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, a molten salt assisted pyrolysis process and the final metal replacement. The metal SNCs (mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm) derived from the metal nodes of the MOF are exclusively confined and homogeneously dispersed throughout the organic ligands derived HPC at high loadings (up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The obtained Cu&#8208;Pd@HPC composite exhibits superior catalytic activity and recycling durability in the selective transformation of furfural to maleic acid, achieving 97.8&#8201;% yield of maleic acid with a TOF value as high as 20.1&#8197;h&#8722;1 under mild conditions. DFT calculations reveal that the introduction of Pd shifts the partial density of states of Cu toward the Fermi level, leading to stronger chemisorption of furfural to enhance the catalytic activity.

         <title>Effect of Zinc&#8208;Doping on the Reduction of the Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Rate in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10957-10963, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper Zn&#8208;doping (0.34&#8201;%) in perovskites is found to be able to significantly slowdown the hot&#8208;carrier cooling, the cooling rate of the 500&#8197;K hot&#8208;carriers can be reduced down to one third of the un&#8208;doped sample. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations uncover the mechanisms of such efficient retardation of the hot&#8208;carrier cooling via Zn&#8208;doping.







Abstract
The fast hot&#8208;carrier cooling process in the solar&#8208;absorbers fundamentally limits their photon&#8208;conversion efficiencies. It is highly desirable to develop a solar absorber with long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carriers at sun&#8208;illumination intensity, which can be used to develop the hot&#8208;carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc&#8208;doped (0.34&#8201;%) halide perovskites have the slower hot&#8208;carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 1017&#8197;cm&#8722;3 is found to be &#8776;3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for T=500&#8197;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaches the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation processes. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which would be invaluable for the further development of practical hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics based on perovskites.

It is highly desirable to develop a solar absorber with long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carriers at sun&#8208;illumination intensity, which can be used to develop the hot&#8208;carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc&#8208;doped (0.34&#8201;%) halide perovskites have the slower hot&#8208;carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; is found to be &#8776;3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for T=500&#8197;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaches the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation processes. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which would be invaluable for the further development of practical hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics based on perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hierarchical Metal&#8211;Polymer Hybrids for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10977-10982, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8211;polymer hybrids constructed from various metals and different polymers showed outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO2 with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes were found to be critical for high performance.







Abstract
The design of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability is key to the electroreduction of CO2. Herein, we report the synthesis of 3D hierarchical metal/polymer&#8211;carbon paper (M/polymer&#8208;CP) electrodes by in situ electrosynthesis. The 3D polymer layer on CP (polymer&#8208;CP) was first prepared by in situ electropolymerization, then a 3D metal layer was decorated on the polymer&#8208;CP to produce the M/polymer&#8208;CP electrode. Electrodes with different metals (e.g. Cu, Pd, Zn, Sn) and various polymers could be prepared by this method. The electrodes could efficiently reduce CO2 to desired products, such as C2H4, CO, and HCOOH, depending on the metal used. For example, C2H4 could be formed with a Faradaic efficiency of 59.4&#8201;% and a current density of 30.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 by using a very stable Cu/PANI&#8208;CP electrode in an H&#8208;type cell. Control experiments and theoretical calculations showed that the 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes are critical for the excellent performance.

         <title>Controlled Ligand Exchange Between Ruthenium Organometallic Cofactor Precursors and a Na&#239;ve Protein Scaffold Generates Artificial Metalloenzymes Catalysing Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10919-10927, May 3, 2021. </description>

A ruthenium organometallic complex is transformed into an effective transfer hydrogenation catalyst upon exchanging ligands with a na&#239;ve protein. The direct coordination of protein sidechains to the metal is an underutilised feature in artificial metalloenzymes.







Abstract
Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing RuII(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes via ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non&#8208;biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein&#8208;derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4&#8208;helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35&#8208;fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.

         <title>ReI Tricarbonyl Complexes as Coordinate Covalent Inhibitors for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Cysteine Protease</title>

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 has impacted the life quality and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Herein, a novel approach using ReI tricarbonyl complexes as coordinate covalent inhibitors for the main protease is presented. These complexes target the active site cysteine residue and show selective inhibition of the main protease over several human proteases.







Abstract
Since its outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has impacted the quality of life and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Based on its global spread and mortality, there is an urgent need for novel treatments which can combat this disease. To date, the 3&#8208;chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease, is considered among the most important pharmacological targets. The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non&#8208;covalent binders. Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease. ReI tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro. Preliminary studies indicate the selective inhibition of 3CLpro over several human proteases. This study presents the first example of metal complexes as inhibitors for the 3CLpro cysteine protease.

         <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10775-10783, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides under plausible prebiotic conditions with diamidophosphate gives rise to 5&#8242;&#8208;amidophosphorylated nucleotides and concomitantly to the 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;linked DNA oligomers. This direct conversion of deoxynucleosides to DNA oligonucleotides in a single pot scenario&#8212;under conditions compatible with ribonucleosides&#8212;sets the stage for the potential emergence of RNA and DNA from mixtures of nucleosides.







Abstract
Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8211;DNA chimeras (RDNA) enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA&#8212;under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776;60&#8201;%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine deoxynucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine deoxynucleotides (&#8776;20&#8201;%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776;18&#8211;31&#8201;%) is observed with predominantly 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5&#8201;%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP&#8208;mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8211;DNA coevolution.

         <title>Distinct Sustainable Carbon Nanodots Enable Free Radical Photopolymerization, Photo&#8208;ATRP and Photo&#8208;CuAAC Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10983-10991, May 3, 2021. </description>

Sustainable carbon dots are prepared as light&#8208;sensitive materials originating from different biomass. Based on their implemented moieties they enable to initiate free radical polymerization choosing LEDs at different wavelength and tailor&#8208;made polymer synthesis facilitating photo&#8208;ATRP and photo click chemistry. CDs take the offer to compete with traditional ATRP based on CuI regarding the dispersity of the polymeric material.







Abstract
Carbon nanodots (CDs) originating from different biomass result in different activities to sensitize photo&#8208;ATRP and photo&#8208;CuAAC reaction protocols with visible light. Free radical polymerization of tri(propylene glycol)diacrylate also exhibited a good efficiency using CDs in combination with an iodonium salt employing LEDs emitting either at 405&#8197;nm, 525&#8197;nm or 660&#8197;nm. Photo&#8208;ATRP experiments confirmed controlled polymerization conditions using CuII at the ppm scale resulting in dispersities between 1.06 to 1.10. Chain end fidelity was successfully provided by chain extension and block copolymerization additionally approving the living feature of polymerization using a CD synthesized from lac dye comprising olefinic moieties in the originating biomass. By global analysis, time resolved fluorescence measurements indicated the appearance of several emitting species contributing to the reactivity of the excited states. Different cytotoxic response appeared following the answer of MCF&#8208;10A cells in a flow cytometry assay; that is 400&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Thus, cell viability was greater 80&#8201;% in the case of CD&#8208;2&#8211;CD&#8208;5 while that of CD&#8208;1 was close to 70&#8201;%.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pot Template Reaction Towards a Manganese&#8208;Based T1 Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10736-10744, May 3, 2021. </description>

We present a single&#8208;pot template synthesis strategy for a manganese&#8208;based MRI contrast agent, MnLMe. MnLMe is highly inert toward zinc&#8208;transmetallation and displays enhanced T1 relaxivity upon non&#8208;covalent interaction with serum albumin. In&#8197;vivo studies show higher contrast enhancement in the liver and longer blood half&#8208;life than that of the commercially available contrast agent Magnevist. MnLMe shows great potential for use as a blood pool agent.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based contrast agents (MnCAs) have emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single&#8208;pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA, MnLMe, and studied the most important physicochemical properties in&#8197;vitro. MnLMe displays optimized r1 relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64&#8197;MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400&#8197;MHz) and an enhanced r1b=21.1&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (20&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K, pH&#8197;7.4) upon binding to BSA (Ka=4.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). In&#8197;vivo studies show that MnLMe is cleared intact into the bladder through renal excretion and has a prolonged blood half&#8208;life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist. MnLMe shows great promise as a novel MRI contrast agent.

         <title>The Role of Metal Substitution in Tuning Anion Redox in Sodium Metal Layered Oxides Revealed by X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10880-10887, May 3, 2021. </description>

The link between the high&#8208;valent structure of P2&#8208;type sodium layered transition metal oxides and the redox properties involving oxygen redox is demonstrated. By substituting Fe with Cu and Ni from P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2, the antisite&#8208;vacancy defect formation is controlled during desodiation of the positive electrodes. Ligand to metal charge transfer and the O 2p state near the Fermi level evoke and stabilize oxygen redox from the electrodes.







Abstract
We investigate high&#8208;valent oxygen redox in the positive Na&#8208;ion electrode P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 (NMF) where Fe is partially substituted with Cu (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.66Fe0.20Cu0.14]O2, NMFC) or Ni (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.65Fe0.20Ni0.15]O2, NMFN). From combined analysis of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge structure with electrochemical voltage hysteresis and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function profiles, we correlate structural disorder with high&#8208;valent oxygen redox and its improvement by Ni or Cu substitution. Density of states calculations elaborate considerable anionic redox in NMF and NMFC without the widely accepted requirement of an A&#8208;O&#8208;A&#8242; local configuration in the pristine materials (where A=Na and A&#8242;=Li, Mg, vacancy, etc.). We also show that the Jahn&#8211;Teller nature of Fe4+ and the stabilization mechanism of anionic redox could determine the extent of structural disorder in the materials. These findings shed light on the design principles in TM and anion redox for positive electrodes to improve the performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.

A simple strategy comprising of the grafting of amino acids onto porous MOFs followed by metalation with earth&#8208;abundant metals, such as iron, affords heterogeneous single&#8208;site chiral catalysts by site isolation. The iron catalysts displayed high activity and excellent enantioselectivity in hydrosilylation and hydroboration of carbonyls.







Abstract
We report a strategy to develop heterogeneous single&#8208;site enantioselective catalysts based on naturally occurring amino acids and earth&#8208;abundant metals for eco&#8208;friendly asymmetric catalysis. The grafting of amino acids within the pores of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), followed by post&#8208;synthetic metalation with iron precursor, affords highly active and enantioselective (&gt;99&#8201;% ee for 10 examples) catalysts for hydrosilylation and hydroboration of carbonyl compounds. Impressively, the MOF&#8208;Fe catalyst displayed high turnover numbers of up to 10&#8201;000 and was recycled and reused more than 15 times without diminishing the enantioselectivity. MOF&#8208;Fe displayed much higher activity and enantioselectivity than its homogeneous control catalyst, likely due to the formation of robust single&#8208;site catalyst in the MOF through site&#8208;isolation.

         <title>Impact of In&#8208;Cell and In&#8208;Vitro Crowding on the Conformations and Dynamics of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein</title>

In&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy reveals the effects of intracellular crowding on the dimensions and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.







Abstract
The conformations and dynamics of proteins can be influenced by crowding from the large concentrations of macromolecules within cells. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit chain compaction in crowded solutions in vitro, but no such effects were observed in cultured mammalian cells. Here, to increase intracellular crowding, we reduced the cell volume by hyperosmotic stress and used an IDP as a crowding sensor for in&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy. In these more crowded cells, the IDP exhibits compaction, slower chain dynamics, and much slower translational diffusion, indicating a pronounced concentration and length&#8208;scale dependence of crowding. In vitro, these effects cannot be reproduced with small but only with large polymeric crowders. The observations can be explained with polymer theory and depletion interactions and indicate that IDPs can diffuse much more efficiently through a crowded cytosol than a globular protein of similar dimensions.

         <title>Chiral Dibenzopentalene&#8208;Based Conjugated Nanohoops through Stereoselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10680-10689, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral, dibenzo[a,e]pentalene&#8208;based conjugated nanohoops were synthesized in a stereoselective way from enantiomerically pure diketone precursors. The hoop shows ambipolar electrochemical behavior due to the antiaromaticity of the dibenzopentalene units and can accommodate two fullerene molecules. Circular dichroism measurements and molecular dynamics simulations indicated no racemization even at 110&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Conjugated nanohoops allow to investigate the effect of radial conjugation and bending on the involved &#960;&#8208;systems. They can possess unexpected optoelectronic properties and their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;system makes them attractive for host&#8211;guest chemistry. Bending the &#960;&#8208;subsystems can lead to chiral hoops. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of two enantiomers of chiral conjugated nanohoops by incorporating dibenzo[a,e]pentalenes (DBPs), which are generated in the last synthetic step from enantiomerically pure diketone precursors. Owing to its bent shape, this diketone unit was used as the only bent precursor and novel &#8220;corner unit&#8221; in the synthesis of the hoops. The [6]DBP[4]Ph&#8208;hoops contain six antiaromatic DBP units and four bridging phenylene groups. The small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and ambipolar electrochemical character of the DBP units is reflected in the optoelectronic properties of the hoop. Electronic circular dichroism spectra and MD simulations showed that the chiral hoop did not racemize even when heated to 110 &#176;C. Due to its large diameter, it was able to accommodate two C60 molecules, as binding studies indicate.

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Sheath of Li Ions by Using Hydrogen Bonds for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10871-10879, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath by introducing hydrogen bonds for constructing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;metal batteries is proposed. Depending on the hydrogen bonding of the additives with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent, the regulated solvation sheath promoted the formation of desirable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase with more LiF component and stabilized the electrolytes.







Abstract
The performance of Li anodes is extremely affected by the solvation of Li ions, leading to preferential reduction of the solvation sheath and subsequent formation of fragile solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI), Li dendrites, and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, we propose a novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, through the introduction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent by small amount additives. The addition of such hydrogen bonds reduced the LUMO energy level of anions in electrolyte, promoted the formation of a robust SEI, reduced the amount of free solvent molecules, and enhanced stability of electrolytes. Based on this strategy, flat and dense lithium deposition was obtained. Even under lean electrolytes, at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a fixed capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the Li&#8211;Cu cells showed an impressive CE value of 99.2&#8201;%. The Li&#8208;LiFePO4 full cells showed long&#8208;term cycling stability for more than 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C, with a total capacity loss of only 15&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Making Waxy Salts in Water: Synthetic Control of Hydrophobicity for Anion&#8208;Induced and Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10858-10864, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition in water is an unperfected art in synthetic supramolecular chemistry. We demonstrate that the inherent hydrophobicity of tripodal fluorogenic cations can be synthetically modulated to control the sensitivity toward large, non&#8208;spherical, and charge&#8208;diffuse anions in water.







Abstract
We show that multipodal polycationic receptors function as anion&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitters in water. Prevailing paradigms utilize rigid holes and cavities for ion recognition. We instead built open amphiphilic scaffolds that trigger polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar environment transitions around cationic fluorophores upon anion complexation. This ion&#8208;pairing and aggregation event produces a dramatic enhancement in the emission intensity, as demonstrated by perchlorate as a non&#8208;spherical hydrophobic anion model. A synergetic interplay of C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion hydrogen bonding and tight anion&#8211;&#960;+ contacts underpins this supramolecular phenomenon. By changing the aliphatic chain length, we demonstrate that the response profile and threshold of this signaling event can be controlled at the molecular level. With appropriate molecular design, inherently weak, ill&#8208;defined, and non&#8208;directional van der Waals interaction enables selective, sensitive, and tunable recognition in water.

         <title>The Folding Landscapes of Human Telomeric RNA and DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes are Markedly Different</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10895-10901, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We compare K+&#8208;induced folding of an RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with a sequence homologous DNA G4 using CD spectroscopy and real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. The folding kinetics of RNA and DNA G4 are markedly different: while DNA folding is biphasic, shows kinetic partitioning and involves kinetically favoured off&#8208;pathway intermediates, RNA folding is faster and monophasic. We attribute the differences to different stabilities of the torsion angle &#967;.







Abstract
We investigated the folding kinetics of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures by comparing the K+&#8208;induced folding of an RNA G4 derived from the human telomeric repeat&#8208;containing RNA (TERRA25) with a sequence homologous DNA G4 (wtTel25) using CD spectroscopy and real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. While DNA G4 folding is biphasic, reveals kinetic partitioning and involves kinetically favoured off&#8208;pathway intermediates, RNA G4 folding is faster and monophasic. The differences in kinetics are correlated to the differences in the folded conformations of RNA vs. DNA G4s, in particular with regard to the conformation around the glycosidic torsion angle &#967; that uniformly adopts anti conformations for RNA G4s and both, syn and anti conformation for DNA G4s. Modified DNA G4s with 19F bound to C2&#8242; in arabino configuration adopt exclusively anti conformations for &#967;. These fluoro&#8208;modified DNA (antiTel25) reveal faster folding kinetics and monomorphic conformations similar to RNA G4s, suggesting the correlation between folding kinetics and pathways with differences in &#967; angle preferences in DNA and RNA, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;We compare K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;induced folding of an RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with a sequence homologous DNA G4 using CD spectroscopy and real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. The folding kinetics of RNA and DNA G4 are markedly different: while DNA folding is biphasic, shows kinetic partitioning and involves kinetically favoured off&#8208;pathway intermediates, RNA folding is faster and monophasic. We attribute the differences to different stabilities of the torsion angle &lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;.

         <title>Spherulite&#8208;Like Micelles</title>

A crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer with an amphiphilic corona&#8208;forming block leads to formation of 3D spherulite&#8208;like micelles by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and seeded growth in dilute solution. Micelle growth can be stopped at any stage depending on the unimer feed ratio and provides a powerful model for studying the spherulite growth process.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) and 2D structures by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) can form fascinating hierarchical structures through secondary self&#8208;assembly. But examples of 3D structures formed via hierarchical self&#8208;assembly are rare. Here we report seeded growth experiments in decane of a poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) BCP with an amphiphilic corona forming block in which lenticular platelets grow into classic spherulite&#8208;like uniform colloidally stable structures. These 3D objects are spherically symmetric on the exterior, but asymmetric near the core, where there is a more open structure consisting of sheaf&#8208;like leaves. The most remarkable aspect of these experiments is that growth stops at different stages of growth process, depending upon how much unimer is added in the seeded growth step. The system provides a model for studying spherulitic growth where real&#8208;time observations on their growth at different stages remains challenging.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanoemulsion for Synergistic Photodynamic&#8208;Immunotherapy Against Hypoxic Breast Tumor</title>

A biomimetic nanoemulsion camouflaged with a PD&#8208;1&#8208;expressing cell membrane is fabricated. The PD&#8208;1 protein on the membrane blocks the PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells to relief the immune brake. The perfluorocarbon inside the nanoemulsion supplement oxygen for PDT in hypoxic tumors. The codelivery of photosensitizer DVDMS and PD&#8208;1 protein realizes effective synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy against hypoxic breast tumors.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used as an &#8220;in situ vaccine&#8221; to enhance the response rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. Unfortunately, the high cost and adverse effects of these antibodies, and the hypoxic state of solid tumors limits the efficacy of synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy. Here, we developed a biomimetic nanoemulsion camouflaged with a PD&#8208;1&#8208;expressing cell membrane for synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy against hypoxic breast tumors. The perfluorocarbon of the nanoemulsion could provide oxygen as the source of PDT against hypoxic tumors. Moreover, co&#8208;delivering a photosensitizer and the PD&#8208;1 protein (substituting for a PD&#8208;L1 antibody) achieves the synergy effect of PDT and immunotherapy. Synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy completely inhibited primary and distant subcutaneous 4T1 tumors, mechanistically by boosting the maturation of dendritic cells and tumor infiltration of cytotoxic&#8197;T lymphocytes.

         <title>Selectivity Map for the Late Stages of CO and CO2 Reduction to C2 Species on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10784-10790, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selectivity map is provided for the late stages of CO2 reduction to C2 molecules based on computational models and electrochemical experiments. Sites with moderate coordination are efficient for ethylene production, with Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces. Conversely, kinks and steps are more active for ethanol production.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CORR and CO2RR) using copper catalysts and renewable electricity hold promise as a carbon&#8208;neutral route to produce commodity chemicals and fuels. However, the exact mechanisms and structure sensitivity of Cu electrodes toward C2 products are still under debate. Herein, we investigate ethylene oxide reduction (EOR) as a proxy to the late stages of CORR to ethylene, and the results are compared to those of acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that ethylene oxide undergoes ring opening before exclusively reducing to ethylene via *OH formation. Based on generalized coordination numbers (CN), a selectivity map for the late stages of CORR and CO2RR shows that sites with moderate coordination (5.9 &lt; CN &lt; 7.5) are efficient for ethylene production, with pristine Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces such as Cu(311). In contrast, kinks and edges are more active for ethanol production, while (111) terraces are relatively inert.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Functionalised Hybrid Ultramicroporous Materials that Enable Single&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from a Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10902-10909, May 3, 2021. </description>

Hybrid ultramicroporous materials in which aminopyrazine ligands substitute pyrazine ligands are the first physisorbents that enable polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) ethylene production from ternary C2&#8208;CO2 gas mixtures under ambient conditions thanks to coadsorption of both C2H2 and CO2.







Abstract
Pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous (pore size &lt;7&#8197;&#197;) materials (HUMs) offer benchmark performance for trace carbon capture thanks to strong selectivity for CO2 over small gas molecules, including light hydrocarbons. That the prototypal pyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs are amenable to crystal engineering has enabled second generation HUMs to supersede the performance of the parent HUM, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn, mainly through substitution of the metal and/or the inorganic pillar. Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17=aminopyrazine; M=Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (&gt;99.95&#8201;% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni versus SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.

Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, &lt;b&gt;MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&lt;/b&gt; (17=aminopyrazine; M=Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity but enhanced C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity. &lt;b&gt;MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&lt;/b&gt; are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (&amp;gt;99.95&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&lt;/b&gt;) from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in &lt;b&gt;MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&lt;/b&gt; versus &lt;b&gt;SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Effective Encapsulation of C60 by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Polyamide Macrocyclic Linkers</title>

A ditopic flexible benzylic amide macrocycle was employed as an organic ligand for the assembly of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These reticular materials form non&#8208;interpenetrated channels with a remarkable solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. The incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pockets of these materials was studied, and C60 was able to occupy an impressive 98&#8201;% of them. These materials were selective for the recognition of C60 in the presence of the larger C70.







Abstract
A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)&#8208; and zinc(II)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non&#8208;interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. Unlike metal&#8211;organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability. We studied the incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pocket generated between two macrocycles connected to the same dinuclear clusters, occupying a remarkable 98&#8201;% of the cavities inside the network. The use of these materials as hosts for the selective recognition of different fullerenes was evaluated, mainly encapsulating the smaller size fullerene derivative in several mixtures of C60 and C70.

         <title>Efficient Amino&#8208;Sulfhydryl Stapling on Peptides and Proteins Using Bifunctional NHS&#8208;Activated Acrylamides</title>

Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide activated esters stand among the most used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox. These two types of functional groups are merged in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamide reagents for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. This is a versatile strategy for orthogonal dual&#8208;modification and late&#8208;stage design of functional bioconjugates.







Abstract
Widely used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox, Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated esters, are combined in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides allow for a fast functionalization of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (k2=1.54&#177;0.18&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) under dilute aqueous conditions, enabling selectivity over other nucleophilic amino acids. Additionally, the versatility of these new bioconjugation handles was demonstrated in the cross&#8208;linking of in&#8208;chain or C&#8208;terminal cysteines with nearby lysine residues. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides are compatible with the use of other cysteine selective reagents, allowing for orthogonal dual&#8208;modifications. This strategy was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins with a PEG unit, fluorescent probe, and cytotoxic agent. The level of molecular control offered by NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides is expected to promote amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling technology as a powerful strategy to design functional bioconjugates.

A Lewis trio involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C6F5)3 and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effective enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls or &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.

A three&#8208;component Lewis acid&#8211;base (Lewis trio) involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C6F5)3 and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effective enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The bulky tertiary amine was found to activate a bulky primary&#8211;tertiary diamine&#8211;borane Lewis pair for enamine catalysis via frustrated interaction. The resulted chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls or &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.

         <title>Conductive Metallophthalocyanine Framework Films with High Carrier Mobility as Efficient Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10806-10813, May 3, 2021. </description>

A fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and conductive 2D metallophthalocyanine framework with cobalt tetraaza[14]annulene linkages (see structure) exhibited high electrical conductivity of up to 0.52&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8201;s&#8722;1. Thin films of the material with thicknesses of 100&#8211;1000&#8197;nm functioned as efficient chemiresistors and displayed high sensitivity and selectivity towards gases at low concentrations.







Abstract
The poor electrical conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline frameworks greatly limits their utilization in optoelectronics and sensor technology. Herein, we describe a conductive metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework with cobalt(II) tetraaza[14]annulene linkages. The high conjugation across the whole network combined with densely stacked metallophthalocyanine units endows this material with high electrical conductivity, which can be greatly enhanced by doping with iodine. The NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework was also fabricated as thin films with different thicknesses from 100 to 1000&#8197;nm by the steam&#8208;assisted conversion method. These films enabled the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases and exhibited remarkable sensitivity and stability. This study indicates the enormous potential of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based conductive frameworks in advanced stand&#8208;off chemical sensors and provides a general strategy through tailor&#8208;make molecular design to develop sensitive and stable chemical sensors for the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Size&#8208;Controlled m&#8208;Pyridine&#8211;Urea Oligomers and Their Biomimetic Chloride Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10833-10841, May 3, 2021. </description>

Oligomers with distinct self&#8208;folding and self&#8208;assembly behaviour are constructed by using m&#8208;pyridine&#8211;urea repeating units, an important feature of which is that the urea carbonyl tends to point outward and the NH unit tends to direct inward. Among these oligomers, the trimer forms nanotubes, which can efficiently transport Cl&#8722; ions.







Abstract
The m&#8208;pyridine urea (mPU) oligomer was constructed by using the intramolecular hydrogen bond formed by the pyridine nitrogen atom and the NH of urea and the intermolecular hydrogen bond of the terminal carbonyl group and the NH of urea. Due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonds, mPU oligomer folds and exhibits strong self&#8208;assembly behaviour. Affected by folding, mPU oligomer generates a twisted plane, and one of its important features is that the carbonyl group of the urea group orientates outwards from the twisted plane, while the NHs tend to direct inward. This feature is beneficial to NH attraction for electron&#8208;rich species. Among them, the trimer self&#8208;assembles into helical nanotubes, and can efficiently transport chloride ions. This study provides a novel and efficient strategy for constructing self&#8208;assembled biomimetic materials for electron&#8208;rich species transmission.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photopolymerization of Hybrid Acrylate&#8208;Oxetane Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10935-10941, May 3, 2021. </description>

A wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization process of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture was developed. Control over the sequence and rate of both polymerizations allows for control over phase separation within the interpenetrating network structure. The structurally colored cholesteric coatings could be used to monitor the phase separation.







Abstract
We report on the wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture. By controlling the sequence and rate of the orthogonal free&#8208;radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions, it is possible to control the degree of phase separation in the resulting liquid crystal interpenetrating networks. We show that this can be used to tune the reflective color of the structurally colored coatings produced. Conversely, the structural color can be used to monitor the degree of phase separation. Our new photopolymerization procedure allows for structuring liquid crystal networks in three dimensions, which has great potential for fabricating liquid crystal polymer materials with programmable functional properties.

The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties including low bioavailability and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. Herein we demonstrate the potential for using mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane, leading to enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity in cancer cells compared to the &#8220;uncaged&#8221; metallodrug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity and translocation to the cell nucleus.







Abstract
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties, such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. To combat this, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. In this work, we demonstrate the use of mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes incorporating as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This compound cannot interact with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper can be cleaved by either light or an esterase, releasing the PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, arising from the translocation of PtII&#8208;salphen to the nucleus and its binding to DNA.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10670-10679, May 3, 2021. </description>

The genome&#8208;guided discovery of an autoinducing peptide (AIP) that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum is reported. A combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain reveals that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP).







Abstract
Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density&#8208;dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone&#8208;containing peptides, their true structures remain elusive. Here, we report the genome&#8208;guided discovery of an AIP that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain, we reveal that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP). Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid S&#8594;N acyl shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme&#8208;primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial AIP biosynthesis.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Rapid Synthesis of Pd&#8208;Based Ultrathin Porous Intermetallic Nanosheets for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10942-10949, May 3, 2021. </description>

This template&#8208;directed synthetic strategy is a universal route for shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanocrystals and will provide new opportunities for intermetallic nanocatalysts.







Abstract
Atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles exhibit improved catalytic activity and durability relative to random alloy counterparts. However, conventional methods with time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;temperature syntheses only have rudimentary capability in controlling the structure of intermetallic nanoparticles, hindering advances of intermetallic nanocatalysts. We report a template&#8208;directed strategy for rapid synthesis of Pd&#8208;based (PdM, M=Pb, Sn and Cd) ultrathin porous intermetallic nanosheets (UPINs) with tunable sizes. This strategy uses preformed seeds, which act as the template to control the deposition of foreign atoms and the subsequent interatomic diffusion. Using the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a model reaction, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Pb UPINs exhibit superior activity, durability, and methanol tolerance. The favored geometrical structure and interatomic interaction between Pd and Pb in Pd3Pb UPINs are concluded to account for the enhanced ORR performance.

However, conventional methods with time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;temperature syntheses only have rudimentary capability in controlling the structure of intermetallic nanoparticles, hindering advances of intermetallic nanocatalysts. We report a template&#8208;directed strategy for rapid synthesis of Pd&#8208;based (PdM, M=Pb, Sn and Cd) ultrathin porous intermetallic nanosheets (UPINs) with tunable sizes. This strategy uses preformed seeds, which act as the template to control the deposition of foreign atoms and the subsequent interatomic diffusion. Using the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a model reaction, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb UPINs exhibit superior activity, durability, and methanol tolerance. The favored geometrical structure and interatomic interaction between Pd and Pb in Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb UPINs are concluded to account for the enhanced ORR performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides: Ultrafast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations Towards Well&#8208;defined Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10798-10805, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids are introduced. The SCA monomers are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The polymerizations reach complete conversion within minutes at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, and retained stereoregularity.







Abstract
Aliphatic polythioesters are popular polymers because of their appealing performance such as metal coordination ability, high refractive indices, and biodegradability. One of the most powerful approaches for generating these polymers is the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers. However, the synthesis of precisely controlled polythioesters via ROP of thiolactones still faces formidable challenges, including the minimal functional diversity of available thiolactone monomers, as well as inevitable transthioesterification side reactions. Here we introduce a hyperactive class of S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids that are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ROP. Inclusion of the initiator PPNOBz ([PPN]=bis(triphenylphosphine)&#8208;iminium) with chain transfer agent benzoic acid, the polymerizations that can be operated in open vessels reach complete conversion within minutes (1&#8211;2&#8197;min) at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, retained stereoregularity and chemical recyclability. Most fascinating are the functionalized SCAs that allow the incorporating of functional groups along the polythioester chain and thus finely tune their physicochemical performance. Computational studies were carried out to explore the origins of the distinctive rapidity and exquisite selectivity of the polymerizations, offering mechanistic insight and explaining why high polymerizability of SCA monomer is able to facilitate exquisitely selective ring&#8208;opening for enchainment over competing transthioesterification and backbiting reactions.

         <title>Dual Active Sites on Molybdenum/ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyst for Methane Dehydroaromatization: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10709-10715, May 3, 2021. </description>

The bifunctional acidic proton&#8208;carburized Mo active site in Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite was revealed by probing their spatial proximity using double&#8208;resonance solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The spatial interaction of the dual site governs the activity of the catalyst for MDA reaction.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst is promising for direct transformation of natural gas. Understanding the nature of active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 is a challenge for applications. Herein, using 1H{95Mo} double&#8208;resonance solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we identify proximate dual active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst by direct observation of internuclear spatial interaction between Br&#248;nsted acid site and Mo species in zeolite channels. The acidic proton&#8211;Mo spatial interaction is correlated with methane conversion and aromatics formation in the MDA process, an important factor in determining the catalyst activity and lifetime. The evolution of olefins and aromatics in Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 channels is monitored by detecting their host&#8211;guest interactions with both active Mo sites and Br&#248;nsted acid sites via 1H{95Mo} double&#8208;resonance and two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8211;1H correlation NMR spectroscopy, revealing the intermediate role of olefins in hydrocarbon pool process during the MDA reaction.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catabolic Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanosponge for Programmable Drug Delivery and Efficient Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10766-10774, May 3, 2021. </description>

An exquisite cascade DNAzyme&#8208;sustained gene silencing platform was assembled to program the &#8220;mask&#8208;cleave&#8208;release&#8221; of therapeutic DNAzyme from the intelligent DNAzyme nanosponge, where the upstream self&#8208;catabolic DNAzyme mediated the specific and accurate activation of downstream therapeutic DNAzyme for guaranteeing the efficient gene silencing with improved bioavailability.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self&#8208;catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor&#8208;specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self&#8208;excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor&#8208;anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli&#8208;responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10756-10765, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;dimensional design strategy to construct smart fluorescent probes for the precise tracking of senescence. Our approach relies on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in combination with the monitoring of lysosomal microenvironmental pH since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells.







Abstract
The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal). Previous probes for SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous &#946;&#8208;gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal from cancer&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme E. coli &#946;&#8208;gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Harvesting Covalent Organic Framework Bearing Single Nickel Sites as a Highly Efficient Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Cross&#8208;Coupling Dual Catalyst</title>

A dual catalyst (Ace&#8208;COF&#8208;Ni), which is composed of a photosensitive covalent organic framework and single nickel sites, is reported. This dual catalyst exhibits excellent visible&#8208;light and organometallic nickel synergistic catalytic performances for the sulfur&#8211;carbon cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have recently emerged as light&#8208;harvesting devices, as well as elegant heterogeneous catalysts. The combination of these two properties into a dual catalyst has not yet been explored. We report a new photosensitive triazine&#8208;based COF, decorated with single Ni sites to form a dual catalyst. This crystalline and highly porous catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic sulfur&#8211;carbon cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Incorporation of single transition metal sites in a photosensitive COF scaffold with two&#8208;component synergistic catalyst in organic transformation is demonstrated for the first time.

         <title>Decoding the Complex Free Radical Cascade by Using a DNA Framework&#8208;Based Artificial DNA Encoder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10745-10755, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder for the complex free radical cascade was developed. Unlike time&#8208;consuming and vulnerable genome&#8208;encoded systems, it can actively sense and actuate information communications in real time, with enhanced environmental tolerance, broad decoding activities, and concurrent blocking of adverse communications between free radicals and inflammatory signaling, contributing to its anti&#8208;obesity effects.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular communications (DMC) are critical for regulating biological networks to maintain stable organismic functions. However, the complicated, time&#8208;consuming information transmission process involved in genome&#8208;coded DMC and the limited, vulnerable decoding activity generally lead to communication impairment or failure, in response to external stimuli. Herein, we present a conceptually innovative DMC strategy mediated by the DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder. With the free&#8208;radical cascade as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the artificial DNA encoder shows active sensing and real&#8208;time actuation, in&#8197;situ and broad free radical&#8208;decoding efficacy, as well as robust resistance to environmental noise. It can also block undesirable short&#8208;to&#8208;medium&#8208;range communications between free radicals and inflammatory networks, leading to a synergistic anti&#8208;obesity effect. The artificial DNA encoder&#8208;based DMC may be generalized to other communication systems for a variety of applications.

         <title>Division and Regrowth of Phase&#8208;Separated Giant Unilamellar Vesicles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10661-10669, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate division of phase&#8208;separated lipid vesicles following quantitative predictions from an analytical model. The division is controlled by metabolic decomposition or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of a fluorophore. This provides spatiotemporal control over the division of a target vesicle. We regrow phase&#8208;separated vesicles by targeted fusion using DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Success in the bottom&#8208;up assembly of synthetic cells will depend on strategies for the division of protocellular compartments. Here, we describe the controlled division of phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). We derive an analytical model based on the vesicle geometry, which makes four quantitative predictions that we verify experimentally. We find that the osmolarity ratio required for division is 
, independent of the GUV size, while asymmetric division happens at lower osmolarity ratios. Remarkably, we show that a suitable osmolarity change can be triggered by water evaporation, enzymatic decomposition of sucrose or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of CMNB&#8208;fluorescein. The latter provides full spatiotemporal control, such that a target GUV undergoes division whereas the surrounding GUVs remain unaffected. Finally, we grow phase&#8208;separated vesicles from single&#8208;phased vesicles by targeted fusion of the opposite lipid type with programmable DNA tags to enable subsequent division cycles.

A new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs was reported through the reaction of H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI. The N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in solutions and solid states. Furthermore, the reaction can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties, demonstrating their potential applications in organic semiconductors of high performance.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a building block has been intensively investigated for organic semiconductors and light emitting materials. The synthesis of N&#8208;aryl DPPs remains challenging. Herein, we firstly report a new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs through H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI, which shows broad reaction scope. Sixteen N&#8208;aryl DPPs, including phenyl, furan and thiophene as flanking aromatic groups, were synthesized with yields up to 78&#8201;%. These N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in both solutions and solid states, with quantum yields up to 96&#8201;% and 40&#8201;%, respectively. Moreover, we show that the reaction between H&#8208;DPP and diaryliodonium salt can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. Nine &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs were obtained in 27&#8211;61&#8201;% yields. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties with hole mobility of 0.71&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, demonstrating that they are useful building blocks for high performance organic semiconductors.

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperative Catalysis for Decarbonylative Heteroarylation of Carboxylic Acids via C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H Coupling</title>

Bimetallic cooperative catalysis is reported for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H coupling. The cooperative action of copper and palladium catalysts is exploited for chemoselective synthesis of heterobiaryl motifs.

Abstract
Cooperative bimetallic catalysis is a fundamental approach in modern synthetic chemistry. We report bimetallic cooperative catalysis for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of ubiquitous carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H coupling. This novel catalytic system exploits the cooperative action of a copper catalyst and a palladium catalyst in decarbonylation, which enables highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs through the coupling of carboxylic acids with heteroarenes in the absence of prefunctionalization or directing groups. This cooperative decarbonylative method uses common carboxylic acids and shows a remarkably broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), including late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents. Extensive mechanistic and computational studies were conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The key step involves intersection of the two catalytic cycles via transmetallation of the copper&#8211;aryl species with the palladium(II) intermediate generated by oxidative addition/decarbonylation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperative bimetallic catalysis is a fundamental approach in modern synthetic chemistry. We report bimetallic cooperative catalysis for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of ubiquitous carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H coupling. This novel catalytic system exploits the cooperative action of a copper catalyst and a palladium catalyst in decarbonylation, which enables highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs through the coupling of carboxylic acids with heteroarenes in the absence of prefunctionalization or directing groups. This cooperative decarbonylative method uses common carboxylic acids and shows a remarkably broad substrate scope (&amp;gt;70 examples), including late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents. Extensive mechanistic and computational studies were conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The key step involves intersection of the two catalytic cycles via transmetallation of the copper&#8211;aryl species with the palladium(II) intermediate generated by oxidative addition/decarbonylation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co&#8208;Activation of CO2 and N2 with Mott&#8211;Schottky Heterostructure Catalysts</title>

The space&#8211;charge region in Mott&#8211;Schottky Bi&#8208;BiVO4 heterostructures promotes the targeted adsorption and activation of inert N2 and CO2 molecules and further guarantees the exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates with generated CO via C&#8211;N coupling reactions to form the urea precursor *NCON*.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N bond coupling to convert CO2 and N2 molecules into urea under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to harsh industrial processes. However, the adsorption and activation of inert gas molecules and then the driving of the C&#8211;N coupling reaction is energetically challenging. Herein, novel Mott&#8211;Schottky Bi&#8208;BiVO4 heterostructures are described that realize a remarkable urea yield rate of 5.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 12.55&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. Comprehensive analysis confirms the emerging space&#8211;charge region in the heterostructure interface not only facilitates the targeted adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2 molecules on the generated local nucleophilic and electrophilic regions, but also effectively suppresses CO poisoning and the formation of endothermic *NNH intermediates. This guarantees the desired exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates and generated CO to form the urea precursor, *NCON*.

Light&#8208;driven processes based on sustainable materials originating from different biomass such as citric acid in lemon, alginate in seaweed, or lac dye in Kerria lacca have received increased attention for the generation of carbon nanodots (CDs). This enables initiation of radical photopolymerization with visible light. CDs can also be employed to generate tailor&#8208;made polymeric materials by sensitization of copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed ATRP, resulting in small dispersities following classical ATRP and CuACC click chemistry, as reported by Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;10983.

From thought to action. In the creative process of natural product synthesis, the mental movement of atoms to their desired positions encounters the boundaries of real reactivity. In their Communication on page&#8197;10521, Thomas&#8197;B. Poulsen et&#8197;al. report the highly efficient assembly of a series of alkaloid natural products in the streptazone and abikoviromycin family. Precise orchestration of (asymmetric) redox manipulations and rapid scaffold assembly via a selective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction enabled the syntheses.

Multinuclear precious metal sandwich complexes containing an asymmetric center in the cluster were synthesized as described by Shinnosuke Horiuchi, Keisuke Umakoshi, and co&#8208;workers in the Research Article on page&#8197;10654. Reversible multipoint coordination in the cluster core can endow them with a remarkable stability, allowing separation of enantiomers and detection of chiroptical properties of the sandwich complexes in solution.

         <title>Boron in Prebiological Evolution</title>

Research suggests that borate could have mediated the prebiotic synthesis of RNA precursors (ribose, ribonucleosides, and ribonucleotides) in reactions relevant for the origin of life. This minireview provides an overview of recent developments in prebiological chemistry related to boron species.







Abstract
Boron(III), as borate (or boric acid), mediates the synthesis of ribose, ribonucleosides, and ribonucleotides. These reactions are carried out under moderate temperatures (typically 70&#8211;95&#8201;&#176;C) with organic molecules (or their derivatives) detected in interstellar space and inorganic ions found in minerals on Earth (and could occur during early stages of prebiotic evolution). Research in this century suggests that borate was a relevant prebiological reagent, thus reinforcing the RNA world hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of life. Herein, these developments on prebiological chemistry related to boron species are reviewed.

         <title>Alternative Oxidants for the Catalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10502-10515, May 3, 2021. </description>

The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane to C2 products with O2 (O2&#8208;OCM) is challenged by overoxidation to CO and CO2, despite extensive research. OCM with alternative oxidants such as N2O, CO2, S2 may provide a route to higher C2 selectivities. This Review analyzes progress on catalytic OCM with alternative oxidants, discussing the current status and future prospects.







Abstract
The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O2&#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to COx products. Other gaseous reagents such as N2O, CO2, and S2 have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O2. Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X&#8208;OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N2O, CO2, S2, and other non&#8208;O2 oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O2&#8208;OCM. Current outlook and potential areas for future study are also discussed.

         <title>Probing the Mineral&#8211;Water Interface with Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10482-10501, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between minerals and water is relevant for a wide range of geological, atmospheric, environmental, and electro(photo&#8208;)chemical systems. This Review highlights the developments made through studying a variety of mineral&#8211;water interfaces by nonlinear optical spectroscopy. These methods provide molecular&#8208;level details about the organization of water in the direct vicinity of the interface.







Abstract
The interaction between minerals and water is manifold and complex: the mineral surface can be (de)protonated by water, thereby changing its charge; mineral ions dissolved into the aqueous phase screen the surface charges. Both factors affect the interaction with water. Intrinsically molecular&#8208;level processes and interactions govern macroscopic phenomena, such as flow&#8208;induced dissolution, wetting, and charging. This realization is increasingly prompting molecular&#8208;level studies of mineral&#8211;water interfaces. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in surface&#8208;specific nonlinear spectroscopy techniques such as sum frequency and second harmonic generation (SFG/SHG), which can provide information about the molecular arrangement of the first few layers of water molecules at the mineral surface. The results illustrate the subtleties of both chemical and physical interactions between water and the mineral as well as the critical role of mineral dissolution and other ions in solution for determining those interactions.

The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical generation of H2O2 is a promising approach for the large&#8208;scale production of this important green fuel and oxidant. Recent developments in H2O2 production on the anode side, including property evaluation and material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing the selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation, are comprehensively discussed in this Minireview.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as a green fuel and oxidant, has drawn increasing attention in the energy and environmental research. Compared with the traditional anthraquinone process, the electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) syntheses of H2O2 are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly. In order to construct membraneless EC/PEC devices for the full H2O2 synthesis, anodic H2O2 production by water oxidation, which is less developed than cathodic H2O2 generation, is highly desirable. Here, we review recent developments for the EC/PEC H2O2 production by water oxidation, including fundamental aspects, benchmarking activity evaluation, material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and outlook of water oxidation for H2O2 production, especially device&#8208;level development, accumulation and stability, and industrial applications. Our review is intended to stimulate studies further improving EC/PEC H2O2 production.

         <title>Biased Symmetry Breaking and Chiral Control by Self&#8208;Replicating in Achiral Tetradentate Platinum (II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10531-10536, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of achiral platinum (II) complexes showed controllable biased symmetry breaking and circularly polarized luminescence in twisted grain boundary mesophase. Among them, the distorted geometry and twisted self&#8208;assembled nanobelts could be responsible for the intense optical activity (CD and CPL). Unprecedently, the handedness of LCs film can be inherited by self&#8208;replicating.







Abstract
Obtaining homochirality from biased symmetry&#8208;breaking of self&#8208;assembly in achiral molecules remains a great challenge due to the lack of ingenious strategies and controlling their handedness. Here, we report the first case of biased symmetry breaking from achiral platinum (II) liquid crystals which self&#8208;organize into an enantiomerically enriched single domain without selection of handedness in twist grain boundary TGB [*] phase. Most importantly, the chiral control of self&#8208;organization can be achieved by using above the homochiral liquid crystal films with determined handedness (P or M) as a template. Moreover, benefiting from self&#8208;assembled superhelix, these complexes exhibit prominent circularly polarized luminescence with high |glum| up to 3.4&#215;10&#8722;3 in the TGB [*] mesophase. This work paves a neoteric avenue for the development of chiral self&#8208;assemblies from achiral molecules.

         <title>Regulating the Local Charge Distribution of Ni Active Sites for the Urea Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10577-10582, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient W&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;WOx UOR catalyst for the urea oxidation reaction has been devised which could be used in CO2 electroreduction devices. A low cell voltage of 2.16&#8197;V was achieved in a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolyzer, saving 15&#8201;% energy compared to standard devices based on the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accounts for a large proportion of the energy consumption. The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives to OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, owing to the sluggish UOR kinetics, its potential in practical use has not been unlocked. Herein, we developed a tungsten&#8208;doped nickel catalyst (Ni&#8208;WOx) with superior activity towards UOR. The Ni&#8208;WOx catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a high turnover frequency of 0.11&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. In further experiments, we found that the W dopant regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni3+ sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni&#8208;WOx into a CO2 flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16&#8197;V accompanying with &#8776;98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide.

         <title>Implantable Biosupercapacitor Inspired by the Cellular Redox System</title>

The present study describes an implantable supercapacitor using NAD+, which is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction.







Abstract
The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn supercapacitor has high potential for in vivo energy storage because it can be used in aqueous environments and stitched to inner parts of the body, such as blood vessels. The biocompatibility issue for frequently used pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, is controversial in the human body. Here, we report an implantable CNT yarn supercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system. In all living cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Based on this redox system, CNT yarn electrodes were fabricated by inserting a twist in CNT sheets with electrochemically deposited NAD and benzoquinone for redox shuttling. Consequently, the NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes exhibited the maximum area capacitance (55.73&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under physiological conditions, such as phosphate&#8208;buffered saline and serum. In addition, the yarn electrodes showed a negligible loss of capacitance after 10&#8201;000 repeated charge/discharge cycles and deformation tests (bending/knotting). More importantly, NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes implanted into the abdominal cavity of a rat's skin exhibited the stable in vivo electrical performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, these findings demonstrate a redox biomolecule&#8208;applied platform for implantable energy storage devices.

Abstract
The development of new methodologies enabling a facile access to valuable heterocyclic frameworks still is an important subject of research. In this context, we describe a dual catalytic cycle merging C&#8722;H alkynylation of phenols and oxy&#8208;alkynylation of the newly introduced triple bond by using a unique redox property and the carbophilic &#960;&#8197;acidity of gold. Mechanistic studies support the participation of a bimetallic gold&#8211;silver species. The one&#8208;pot protocol offers a direct, simple, and regio&#8208;specific approach to 3&#8208;alkynyl benzofurans from readily available phenols. A broad range of substrates, including heterocycles, is transferred with excellent functional group tolerance. Thus, this methodology can be used for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of benzofurans.

&lt;p&gt;A mild and general synthesis of 3&#8208;alkynylbenzofurans from readily available phenols by Au&#8211;Ag bimetallic catalysis has been developed. Importantly, this also advances our mechanistic understanding of the &#8220;silver effect&#8221; in gold redox chemistry.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Semiconductive and Photoactive Heterobimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Capsule</title>

A mixed Fe3+/Co2+&#8208;seamed capsule comprising multiple heterometallic metal&#8211;metal interactions is presented. This capsule displays unexpected semiconducting and photoelectric conversion properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a novel metal&#8211;organic capsule constructed from six pyrogallol[4]arene macrocycles, which are switched together by 16&#8201;FeIII and 16&#8201;CoII ions. This supramolecular structure is the first instance of a spheroidal heterometallic nanocage assembled through a one&#8208;step metal&#8211;ligand coordination approach. This new assembly also demonstrates an important proof of concept through the formation of multiple heterometallic metal&#8211;metal interactions within the capsule framework. Photophysical and electrochemical studies of self&#8208;assembled capsule films indicate their potential as semiconductors. These materials display unexpected photoelectric conversion properties, thus representing an emergent phenomenon in discrete metal&#8211;organic supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Toward a Photoinduced Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Showing High Coercivity Values</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10537-10541, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced spin&#8208;crossover switchable single&#8208;chain magnet was discovered in an asymmetric ditopic ligand&#8208;containing cyanide&#8208;bridged compound. A photoinduced opening hysteresis with the highest coercive field of 1.3&#8197;T was realized in pure 3d metal&#8208;based molecular magnets.







Abstract
The production of photo&#8208;switchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is challenging. Introducing photo&#8208;responsive spin&#8208;crossover units provides a feasible means of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, interactions, and overall nanomagnet properties. Herein, we report a cyanide&#8208;bridged chain 1&#8901;12H2O ({[(PzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2FeII(Pmat)2}n&#8901;12&#8201;H2O) generated by linking the FeII&#8208;based spin&#8208;crossover unit with the [(PzTp)Fe(CN)3]&#8722; (PzTp: tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate) building block in the presence of asymmetric ditopic ligand Pmat ((4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyleneamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole). Structural characterization revealed that the introduction of this asymmetric ligand led to a distorted coordination environment of FeII ions, which were equatorially coordinated by four cyanide N atoms, and apically coordinated by one pyridine N atom and one triazole N atom. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation, 1&#8901;12H2O underwent photoinduced spin&#8208;crossover and exhibited single&#8208;chain magnet behavior with a coercive field of up to 1.3&#8197;T. This represents a 3d&#8208;based photoinduced single&#8208;chain magnet exhibiting pronounced hysteresis.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of 3d&#8208;Block Metal (Hydro)oxides by Ligand&#8208;Induced Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10614-10619, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy was proposed to boost the electrocatalytic activities of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides. After the introduction of an organic ligand, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) increased by &#8776;5.7 times.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy&#8208;related applications that feature easily tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, considering that most 3d&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands downshifts the d&#8208;band center, which narrows the band gap, and optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. For example, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be greatly promoted by &#8776;5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a terephthalic acid (TPA)&#8208;induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe2O4, NiCo2O4, and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90&#945; Isoform</title>

The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. A structure&#8208;based approach was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.







Abstract
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. Many of these proteins contribute to the progression of cancer, and consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery represents an innovative approach toward cancer chemotherapy. However, clinical trials with Hsp90 N&#8208;terminal inhibitors have encountered deleterious side effects and toxicities, which appear to result from the pan&#8208;inhibition of all four Hsp90 isoforms. Therefore, the development of isoform&#8208;selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure&#8208;based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.

Therefore, the development of isoform&#8208;selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure&#8208;based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &amp;gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strong Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acidic Sites in the Borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10643-10646, May 3, 2021. </description>

The ever&#8208;expanding chemistry of borosulfates is enriched by the novel borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 featuring an unprecedented Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct of water to the anion [B(SO4)3]3&#8722;. Isodesmic exchange calculations revealed high Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acidity, opening new insights and perspectives for this fascinating silicate&#8208;analogous material class.







Abstract
Borosulfates provide fascinating structures and properties that go beyond a pure analogy to silicates. Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 is the first borosulfate featuring a boron atom solely coordinated by three tetrahedra. Thus, the free Lewis acidic site forms a Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct with a water molecule. This is unprecedented for borosulfate chemistry and even for borates. Quantum chemical calculations on water exchange reactions with BF3 and B(C6F5)3 revealed a higher Lewis acidity for the borosulfate anion. Moreover, proton exchange reactions showed a higher Br&#248;nsted acidity than comparable silicates or phosphates. Additionally, Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2 was characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Exploring a Fatigue&#8208;Free Layered Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric for Photovoltaic Non&#8208;Volatile Memories</title>

A fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7, is demonstrated for exploration of photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
Through a functional unit&#8208;transmutation strategy, a fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7 (BCPB) has been developed, which demonstrates stable spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 6.5&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high Curie temperature up to 425&#8197;K. Meanwhile, BCPB shows splendid bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;105); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO3. The unique structure with self&#8208;regulated net electrical charged layers gives rise to the fatigue&#8208;free feature of Ps and BPVE (no significant fatigue after 108 polarity switching cycles), promoting the potential applications of BCPB in photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. This work offers an efficient approach for exploring fatigue&#8208;free semiconducting ferroelectrics as well as excavates their further applications in next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

Solvent polarity tunes the interplay of excimer formation and symmetry breaking charge separation (SB&#8211;CS) in the photoexcited subphthalocyanine dimer.







Abstract
Knowledge of the factors controlling excited state dynamics in excitonically coupled dimers and higher aggregates is critical for understanding natural and artificial solar energy conversion. In this work, we report ultrafast solvent polarity dependent excited state dynamics of the structurally well&#8208;defined subphthalocyanine dimer, &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Stationary electronic spectra demonstrate strong exciton coupling in &#956;&#8208;OSubPc2. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal ultrafast excimer formation from the initially excited exciton, mediated by intramolecular structural evolution. In polar solvents the excimer state decays directly through symmetry breaking charge transfer to form a charge separated state. Charge separation occurs under control of solvent orientational relaxation.

         <title>Selective Prebiotic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Threofuranosyl Cytidine by Photochemical Anomerization</title>

TNA cytidine, a candidate precursor to RNA cytidine at the origin of life, is synthesized from prebiotic precursors via a high&#8208;yielding, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, protecting&#8208;group free synthesis utilizing an efficient photochemical anomerization. Phosphorylation also enables selective photodestruction of the contaminating erythro&#8208;diastereomer enriching any potential pool of TNA monomers.







Abstract
The structure of life's first genetic polymer is a question of intense ongoing debate. The &#8220;RNA world theory&#8221; suggests RNA was life's first nucleic acid. However, ribonucleotides are complex chemical structures, and simpler nucleic acids, such as threose nucleic acid (TNA), can carry genetic information. In principle, nucleic acids like TNA could have played a vital role in the origins of life. The advent of any genetic polymer in life requires synthesis of its monomers. Here we demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding, stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and furanosyl&#8208;selective prebiotic synthesis of threo&#8208;cytidine 3, an essential component of TNA. Our synthesis uses key intermediates and reactions previously exploited in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleoside cytidine 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that erythro&#8208;specific 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate synthesis provides a mechanism to photochemically select TNA cytidine. These results suggest that TNA may have coexisted with RNA during the emergence of life.

         <title>Decarboxylative Polyfluoroarylation of Alkylcarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10557-10562, May 3, 2021. </description>

A photocatalyzed decarboxylative polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids is reported. The defluorinative C&#8722;C bond formation through a radical process enables expedient access to polyfluoroaromatics from abundant carboxylic acids.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are useful building blocks in several areas such as drug discovery, materials, and crop protection. Herein, we report the first polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids via photoredox decarboxylation. The method proceeds with broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Moreover, small complex molecules such as natural products and drugs can be modified by late&#8208;stage modification.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Silver Active Sites in Gold Nanoclusters for Chemical Fixation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10573-10576, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the chemical fixation of CO2 were achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au clusters. Au19Ag4(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a completely open surface Ag site has the best catalytic activity, Au20Ag1(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a partially open Ag site is least efficient, and Au21(S&#8208;Adm)15 without a Ag site exhibits decent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Precise control of the composition and structure of active sites in an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fashion remains insuperable for heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we introduce tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au nanoclusters. Our results reveal that a single open Ag site on the Au19Ag4 cluster improves the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides and sequent CO2 insertion, while the partially exposed Ag site on the Au20Ag1 cluster exhibits a weak affinity for epoxides and poor efficiency for CO2 capture. Structural tunability imparted by the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring and unusual atomic charges distributed on Au and Ag atoms of the three clusters seem to be crucial for promoting challenging bond cleavages and formations in the chemical utilization of CO2.

         <title>Direct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alkylations of Ketones in a Combined Copper&#8211;Organocatalyst System</title>

A copper and pyrrolidine dual catalyst system enables the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones to synthesize 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The key intermediates are catalytically generated &#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl radical species and enamines.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient method for the tertiary alkylation of a ketone by using an &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compound as the tertiary alkyl source in a combined Cu&#8208;organocatalyst system. This dual catalyst system enables the addition of a tertiary alkyl radical to an enamine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the catalytically generated enamine is a key intermediate in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used to synthesize substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds containing quaternary carbons bearing various alkyl chains.

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Allylation of Simple Arenes via C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Gem&#8208;difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10626-10631, May 3, 2021. </description>

A rhodium catalyzed C(aryl)&#8722;C(allyl) bond&#8208;forming reaction is achieved via a combination of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C activation. Gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates, enabling C&#8722;H allylation of a variety of simple arenes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a rhodium catalyzed directing&#8208;group free regioselective C&#8722;H allylation of simple arenes. Readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates via a sequence of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond activation, providing allyl arene derivatives in good yields with high regioselectivity under mild conditions. The robust methodology enables facile late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The high efficiency of this reaction is also demonstrated by the high turnover number (TON, up to 1700) of the rhodium catalyst on gram&#8208;scale experiments. Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.

(NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx decorated GO is used as a hole booster in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC. A champion efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% is achieved arising from the charge transfer doping effect between (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx and GO.







Abstract
The precise regulation of interfacial charge distribution highly determines the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inorganic (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (GO) is successfully demonstrated as a hole booster for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC free of precious metal electrode. Arising from the spontaneous electron transfer induced p&#8208;type doping of GO from edged oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups to (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx, the best all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC achieves an efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% under one standard sun owing to the eliminated paradox between charge extraction and charge localization in GO surface. Furthermore, the champion device exhibits an excellent long&#8208;term stability at 10&#8201;% relative humidity without encapsulation over 70&#8197;days because of the suppressed ions migration.

A continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;Fries/imine capture cascade process efficiently assembles the 2,7&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused tetrahydrocarbazole framework of strychnos and akuammiline&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. Based on this crucial transformation, the first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;strictamine have been accomplished.







Abstract
A bioinspired photo&#8208;Fries/imine capture cascade reaction was developed in continuous&#8208;flow mode, which facilitated the rapid construction of a series of diversely functionalized 2,7&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused tetrahydrocarbazoles, the ubiquitous core structures embedded in strychnos and akuammiline&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. The synthetic utility of this novel method has been preliminarily explored by the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;strictamine in a concise and efficient manner.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Separation of n&#8208;Hexane by a Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Reduced Energy Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10593-10597, May 3, 2021. </description>

A dynamic metal&#8208;organic framework with breathing effect shows unique separation properties toward hexane isomers. A reversed relationship between uptake capacity and diffusion rate as a function of temperature caused by the structure dynamic provides a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures and with less energy consumption.







Abstract
The separation of n&#8208;alkanes from their branched isomers is vitally important to improve octane rating of gasoline. To facilitate mass transfer, adsorptive separation is usually operated under high temperatures in industry, which require considerable energy. Herein, we present a kind of dynamic pillar&#8208;layered MOF that exhibits self&#8208;adjustable structure and pore space, a behavior induced by guest molecules. A combination of the flexibility of the framework with the commensurate adsorption for n&#8208;hexane results in exceptional performance in separating hexane isomers. More significantly, lower temperature prompts the guest molecules to open the dynamic pores, which may provide a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures with less energy consumption.

         <title>Preparation of a Multicarbazole&#8208;Based Nanocapsule Capable of Largely Modulating Guest Spectroscopic Properties in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10552-10556, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels was formed from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. The capsule displayed enhanced emissivity, improved electrochemical stability, and unique host abilities toward substituted dyes. Notably, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band from twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion were observed in the cavity.







Abstract
A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels (ca. 12 panels) was quantitatively generated from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. Unlike previously reported macrocycles and coordination cages bearing several carbazole panels, the resultant nanocapsule displays enhanced emissivity and improved electrochemical stability as compared with the monomeric amphiphile. The spectroscopic properties of substituted coumarin and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dyes can be modulated upon encapsulation by the nanocapsule in water. In the cavity, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band is observed from largely twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands are found from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion. Moreover, the encapsulated dimers exhibit unique excimer&#8208;like emission.

         <title>Scalable Negishi Coupling between Organozinc Compounds and (Hetero)Aryl Bromides under Aerobic Conditions when using Bulk Water or Deep Eutectic Solvents with no Additional Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10632-10636, May 3, 2021. </description>

Coupling runs across water and DES: Scalable Pd&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;couplings between (hetero)aryl bromides and organozinc halides have been developed either by using bulk water, or the choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture as a reaction medium. These processes proceed under mild conditions, short reaction times in air, in the absence of additional ligands, with high chemoselectivity and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions between organozinc compounds and (hetero)aryl bromides have been reported when using bulk water as the reaction medium in the presence of NaCl or the biodegradable choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture. Both C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) couplings have been found to proceed smoothly, with high chemoselectivity, under mild conditions (room temperature or 60&#8201;&#176;C) in air, and in competition with protonolysis. Additional benefits include very short reaction times (20&#8197;s), good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%), wide substrate scope, and the tolerance of a variety of functional groups. The proposed novel protocol is scalable, and the practicability of the method is further highlighted by an easy recycling of both the catalyst and the eutectic mixture or water.

In the presence of chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, asymmetric 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;position of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and subsequent in situ lactamization formed chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 43&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% enantioselectivities, providing an interesting and straightforward way to make chemically and biologically significant pyroglutamic acid derivatives.







Abstract
Direct &#945;&#8208;functionalization of NH2&#8208;free glycinates with relatively weak electrophiles such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters still remains a big challenge in organic synthesis. With chiral pyridoxal 5&#8201;d as a carbonyl catalyst, direct asymmetric conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;C of glycinate 1&#8201;a with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters 2 has been successfully realized, to produce various chiral pyroglutamic acid esters 4 in 14&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's after in situ lactamization. The trans and cis diastereomers can be obtained at the same time by chromatography and both of them can be easily converted into chiral 4&#8208;substituted pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones such as Alzheimer's drug Rolipram (11) with the same absolute configuration via tert&#8208;butyl group removal and subsequent Barton decarboxylation.

With chiral pyridoxal &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt; as a carbonyl catalyst, direct asymmetric conjugated addition at the &#945;&#8208;C of glycinate &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; has been successfully realized, to produce various chiral pyroglutamic acid esters &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; in 14&#8211;96&#8201;% yields with 81&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's after in situ lactamization. The &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; diastereomers can be obtained at the same time by chromatography and both of them can be easily converted into chiral 4&#8208;substituted pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones such as Alzheimer's drug Rolipram (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;) with the same absolute configuration via &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl group removal and subsequent Barton decarboxylation.&lt;/p&gt;

Maize to medicine! With annual production at &gt;85&#8197;million tons/year, ethanol is the world's largest&#8208;volume renewable small molecule carbon source, yet its use as a C2&#8208;feedstock in enantioselective C&#8722;C coupling is unknown.

         <title>Honeycomb Carbon Nanofibers: A Superhydrophilic O2&#8208;Entrapping Electrocatalyst Enables Ultrahigh Mass Activity for the Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 19, Page 10583-10587, May 3, 2021. </description>

Honeycomb carbon nanofibers behave as a superb electrocatalyst for selective H2O2 production (97.3&#8201;%) via 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, capable of attaining an ultrahigh mass activity of 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a H2O2 yield rate of 6.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The catalytic mechanism is revealed by in situ Raman analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy&#8208; and waste&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process for distributed H2O2 production. This process, however, suffers from strong competition from the four&#8208;electron pathway leading to low H2O2 selectivity. Herein, we report using a superhydrophilic O2&#8208;entrapping electrocatalyst to enable superb two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysis. The honeycomb carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) are robust and capable of achieving a high H2O2 selectivity of 97.3&#8201;%, much higher than that of its solid carbon nanofiber counterpart. Impressively, this catalyst achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing all other catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Concise Asymmetric Syntheses of Streptazone&#8197;A and Abikoviromycin**

A concise route to deliver [4.3.0] alkaloid natural products featuring an allene&#8208; ynamide Pauson&#8211;Khand cyclization, an asymmetric and highly regioselective epoxidation and a chemoselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction is presented. The route delivers streptazone&#8197;B1, streptazone&#8197;A and abikoviromycin for the first time, and lastly demonstrates an idiosyncratic thiol reactivity characteristic for streptazone&#8197;A.







Abstract
Streptazone&#8197;A and abikoviromycin are alkaloids that both feature an unusual arrangement of reactive functionalities within a compact tricyclic ring system. Here, we report a highly concise asymmetric synthesis of both natural products. The route first constructs another family member, streptazone&#8197;B1, using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed distal selective allene&#8208;ynamide Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction. A regio&#8208; and enantioselective epoxidation under chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions directly afforded streptazone&#8197;A in 8&#8197;steps overall. In one additional step, a chemoselective, iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the enaminone system then gave abikoviromycin. The reactivity of streptazone&#8197;A towards a cysteine mimic, N&#8208;acetylcysteamine, was studied and revealed unanticipated transformations, including bis&#8208;thiol conjugation which may proceed via formation of a cyclopentadienone intermediate. With flexible access to these compounds, studies aimed to identify their direct biological targets are now possible.

         <title>Selectivity and Targeting of G&#8208;quadruplex Binders Activated by Adaptive Binding and Controlled by Chemical Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent in oncogenes and proposed to be potential antitumor drug targets. However, binding selectivity of compounds to G4s still faces challenges. Herein, we report a platinum(II) complex (  Pt1  ), whose affinity to G4&#8208;DNA is activated by adaptive binding and selectivity controlled by binding kinetics. The resolved structure of  Pt1  /VEGF&#8208;G4 (a promoter G4) reveals that  Pt1  matches 3'&#8208;G&#8208;tetrad of VEGF&#8208;G4 through Cl  &#8208;  &#8208;dissociation and loop rearrangement of VEGF&#8208;G4. Binding rate constants are determined by coordination bond breakage/formation and correlate fully with affinities. The selective rate&#8208;determining binding step, Cl  &#8208;  &#8208;dissociation upon G4&#8208;binding which is 2~3 orders of magnitude higher than dsDNA. We further demonstrate that  Pt1  potently targets G4 in living cells, effectively represses  VEGF  expression and inhibits vascular growth in zebrafish. We present adaptive G4&#8208;binding activation and selectivity controlled by kinetics, providing  &#160;a complementary design principle  for compounds targeting G4 or similar biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to hypervalent iodine(III) compounds, the isoelectronic bromine(III) counterparts have been little studied to date. This knowledge gap is mainly attributed to the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control reactivity of  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromanes as well as to their challenging preparation from the highly toxic and corrosive BrF  3  precursor. In this context, we present a straightforward and scalable approach to chelation&#8208;stabilized  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromanes by anodic oxidation of parent aryl bromides possessing two coordinating hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanyl substituents. A series of  para  &#8208;substituted  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromanes with remarkably high redox potentials spanning a range from 1.86 V to 2.60 V vs. Ag/AgNO  3  was synthesized by the electrochemical method. We demonstrate that the intrinsic reactivity of the bench&#8208;stable bromine(III) species can be unlocked by addition of a Lewis or a Br&#248;nsted acid. The synthetic utility of the  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromane activation is exemplified by oxidative arene&#8208;arene homocoupling.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reductive transformations of easily available oxidized matter are at the heart of synthetic manipulation and chemical valorization. The application of catalytic hydrofunctionalization benefit from the use of liquid reducing agents and operationally facile setups. Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroborations provide a highly prolific platform for reductive valorizations of stable C=X electrophiles. Here, we report an especially facile, broad&#8208;scope reduction of various functions incl. carbonyls, carboxylates, pyridines, carbodiimides, carbonates under very mild conditions with the inexpensive pre&#8208;catalyst Mn(hmds)  2  . The reaction could be successfully applied to depolymerizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Reconfigurable DNA&#8208;Based Chemical Reaction Circuits for Soft Matter Computing and Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing smart material system for performing different tasks in diverse environments remains challenging. Here, we show that by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials with multi&#8208;mode reconfigurable DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction circuits (D&#8208;CRCs), it can control size change of microgels with multiple reaction pathways and adapt expansion behaviors to meet diverse environments. We first use pH&#8208;responsive intramolecular conformational switches for regulating DNA strand&#8208;displacement&#8208;reactions (SDRs). The ability to regulate SDRs with tunable pH&#8208;dependence allows to build dynamic chemical reaction networks with diverse reaction pathways. We confirm that the designed DNA switching circuits are reconfigurable at different pH and perform different logic operations, and the swelling of DNA switching circuit&#8208;integrated microgel systems can be programmably directed by D&#8208;CRCs. Our approach provides insight into building smart responsive materials and fabricating autonomous soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of rotational motion in diffusion NMR experiments on supramolecular assemblies: application to Sup35NM fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG) NMR is an important tool for characterization of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies. However, for micron&#8208;sized objects, such as amyloid fibrils, these experiments become difficult to interpret because in addition to translational diffusion they are also sensitive to rotational diffusion. We have constructed a mathematical theory describing the outcome of PFG NMR experiments on rod&#8208;like fibrils. To test its validity, we have studied the fibrils formed by Sup35NM segment of the prion protein Sup35. The interpretation of the PFG NMR data in this system is fully consistent with the evidence from electron microscopy. Contrary to some previously expressed views, the signals originating from disordered regions in the fibrils can be readily differentiated from the similar signals representing small soluble species (e.g. proteolytic fragments). This paves the way for diffusion&#8208;sorted NMR experiments on complex amyloidogenic samples</dc:description>

         <title>Design of an In&#8208;Cell Protein Crystal for the Environmentally Responsive Construction of a Supramolecular Filament</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin B (TbCatB), which is spontaneously produced in insect cells, is used to fabricate protein bundled filaments. The designed disulfide bonds between the monomers are formed by autoxidation in the isolated crystals.







Abstract
Protein assemblies can be designed for development of nano&#8211;bio materials. This has been achieved by modulating protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, fabrication of highly ordered protein assemblies remains challenging. Protein crystals, which have highly ordered arrangements of protein molecules, provide useful source matrices for synthesizing artificial protein assemblies. Here, we describe construction of a supramolecular filament structure by engineering covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in a protein crystal. Performing in&#8208;cell crystallization of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin&#8197;B (TbCatB), we achieved a precise arrangement of protein molecules while suppressing random aggregation due to disulfide bonds. We succeeded in synthesizing bundled filament from the crystals by autoxidation of cysteinyl thiols after the isolation of the crystals from living cells.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering mesopores into microporous organic cages to create hierarchically porous organic cage was explored. The beneficial effect of hierarchical pores on the selective adsorption properties and enhanced catalytic performances was demonstrated.







Abstract
Imparting mesopores to organic cages of an intrinsic microporous nature to build up hierarchically porous cage soft materials is a grand challenge and will reshape the property and application scope of traditional organic cage molecules. Herein, we discovered how to engineer mesopores into microporous organic cages via their host&#8211;guest interactions with long chain ionic surfactants. Equally important, the ionic head of surfactants equips the supramolecularly assembled porous structures with charge&#8208;selective uptake and release function in solution. Interestingly, such hierarchically porous organic cage can serve as a nanoreactor once trapping enzymes within the cavity, which show 5&#8208;fold enhanced activity of enzymatic catalysis when compared with the free enzymes.

         <title>Cascade Oxidative C&#8722;H Annulation of Thiophenes: Heck&#8208;Type Pathway Enables Concise Access to Thienoacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation provides a rapid access to a new class of planar thienoacenes with superior stability. Heck&#8208;type pathway is firstly exemplified as a superior process enabling multiple C&#8722;H fusions of heteroaromatics for the synthesis of heteroacenes.







Abstract
The pursuit of efficient synthetic route to thienoacenes represents an appealing yet challenging task in the fields of both organic synthetic chemistry and organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H annulation of phenacyl phosphoniums with (benzo)thiophenes via a Heck&#8208;type pathway to provide a new class of planar thienoacenes, which involves the formation of three Caryl&#8208;Caryl bonds and one Caryl&#8722;O bond in a single operation. The neutral S,O&#8208;heteroacenes exhibit superior stability and adopt a herringbone&#8208;like packing mode with efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the crystals, suggesting their potential in organic semiconducting materials. This work first exemplifies the superiority of cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation involving a Heck&#8208;type pathway in the development of concise access to heteroacenes.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework Film for Three&#8208;State Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromism and a Molecular Logic Gate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film was synthesized and exhibited three&#8208;state electrochromic properties with sub&#8208;second response time and long retention time in the near&#8208;infrared region. Taking potential and absorbance as input and output signal, respectively, a mimicking logic gate with optical memory functions was demonstrated based on the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film.







Abstract
A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film with three&#8208;state NIR electrochromic properties was designed and synthesized. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film is composed of hexagonal nanosheets with high crystallinity and has three reversible color states at different applied potentials. It has high absorption spectra changes in the NIR region, ascribed to the strong intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) interaction of the Class III mixed&#8208;valence systems of the conjugated triphenylamine species. The film showed sub&#8208;second response time (1.3&#8197;s for coloring and 0.7&#8197;s for bleaching at 1050&#8197;nm) and long retention time in the NIR region. COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film shows superior NIR electrochromic properties in term of response time and stability, attributed to the highly ordered porous structure and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structure of the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA architecture. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film was applied in mimicking a flip&#8208;flop logic gate with optical memory function.

         <title>Catalytic and Enantioselective Control of the C&#8211;N Stereogenic Axis via the Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic and enantioselective control of the C&#8211;N stereogenic axis of heterocyclic scaffolds is reported. The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction is achieved by employing a chiral phosphoric acid via dynamic kinetic resolution. Application to substituted benzaldehyde enables control of both axial and point chirality.







Abstract
An unprecedented example of a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of N&#8208;arylindoles is reported. Highly enantioenriched N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines with C&#8722;N bond axial chirality are obtained via dynamic kinetic resolution. The hydrogen bond donor introduced on the bottom aromatic ring, forming a secondary interaction with the phosphoryl oxygen, is essential to achieving high enantioselectivity. A wide variety of substituents are tolerable with this transformation to provide up to 98&#8201;% ee. The application of electron&#8208;withdrawing group&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes enables the control of both axial and point stereogenicity. Biological evaluation of this new and unique scaffold shows promising antiproliferative activity and emphasizes the significance of atroposelective synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;Undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;Alpneumine&#8197;H</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C has been synthesized in 11 steps from prochiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)cyclohexan&#8208;1&#8208;one (A). It is subsequently converted into (+)&#8208;undulifoline and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H via reductive N&#8208;methylation and diastereoselective N&#8208;oxidation of the tertiary amine.







Abstract
We report herein the enantioselective total synthesis of three monoterpene indole alkaloids, namely, (+)&#8208;alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H. The key features of our synthesis include: a) introduction of chirality via enantioselective deprotonation of a prochiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone; b) use of methoxymethyl (MOM) ether as both a hydroxyl protective group and a latent oxonium species for the formation of bridged oxepane and c) domino double reductive cyclization to build both the indole and the piperidine ring at the end of the synthesis. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these natural products assigned based on the biogenetic hypothesis.

         <title>Hematite Photoanodes for Water Oxidation: Electronic Transitions, Carrier Dynamics, and Surface Energetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current understanding of hematite photoanodes is comprehensively discussed. In light of guidelines for photoanode design, we focus on charge carriers, their origin, early&#8208;stage dynamics, surface dynamics and their competitive interfacial transfer through the valence band edge, surface states, and cocatalysts.







Abstract
We review the current understanding of charge carriers in model hematite photoanodes at different stages. The origin of charge carriers is discussed based on the electronic structure and absorption features, highlighting the controversial assignment of the electronic transitions near the absorption edge. Next, the dynamic evolution of charge carriers is analyzed both on the ultrafast and on the surface reaction timescales, with special emphasis on the arguable spectroscopic assignment of electrons/holes and their kinetics. Further, the competitive charge transfer centers at the solid&#8211;liquid interface are reviewed, and the chemical nature of relevant surface states is updated. Finally, an overview on the function of widely employed surface cocatalysts is given to illustrate the complex influence of physiochemical modifications on the charge carrier dynamics. The understanding of charge carriers from their origin all the way to their interfacial transfer is vital for the future of photoanode design.

         <title>Reduced Arene Complexes of Hafnium Supported by a Triamidoamine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we describe a series of hafnium complexes with a reduced arene of general formula [K(L)][Hf(Xy&#8208;N  3  N)(arene)] (Xy&#8208;N  3  N = {(3,5&#8208;Me  2  C  6  H  3  )NCH  2  CH  2  }  3  N  3&#8722;  , L = THF, 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; arene = C  10  H 8  2&#8722;  , C  14  H  10  2&#8722;  ) which mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N  3  N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of  tert  &#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand. DFT calculations were performed on electronic structure of the reduced anthracene complex as well as the unusual nitrile insertion mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Arylpalladium(II) Boronates: Confirming the Structure of Pre&#8208;transmetalation Intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Reaction&#160;Crystallographically</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(II) boronates are recognized as fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. While these typically transient species have been detected and studied spectroscopically, it is conspicuous that they have never been isolated since this important reaction was discovered over forty years ago. This study reports the synthesis of a family of unprecedented arylpalladium(II) boronates that are, by design, kinetically stable at ambient temperature, both in solution and in the solid state. These properties enabled unambiguous crystallographic confirmation of their structure for the first time and their chemical competence in a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8208;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2H2  + 2CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722;  promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4  and CO2  to free 2H2  + CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of of COads  from the RhTiO2CO&#8211;  to reform RhTiO2&#8211;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Nanoparticulate Organic Photocatalysts via a Scalable Flash Nanoprecipitation Process for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly converting sunlight into hydrogen fuels using particulate photocatalysts represents a sustainable route for clean energy supply. Organic semiconductors have emerged as attractive candidates but always suffer from optical and exciton recombination losses with large exciton &#8220;dead zone&#8221; inside the bulk material, severely limiting the catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy that combines a scalable flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with hydrophilic soluble polymers (  PC&#8208;PEG5  and  PS&#8208;PEG5  ) to prepare highly efficient nanosized photocatalysts without using surfactants. Significantly, a 70&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is achieved for nanosized  PC&#8208;PEG5  , and the FNP&#8208;processed  PS&#8208;PEG5  shows a peak HER rate of up to 37.2 mmol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  under full&#8208;spectrum sunlight irradiation, which is among the highest results for polymer photocatalysts. Moreover, a scaling&#8208;up production of nanocatalyst is demonstrated with the continuously operational FNP, which provides an unprecedented strategy toward practical applications of particulate photocatalysts for sustainable energy production.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of strained aromatic macrocycles based on [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7(4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrahydro)pyrenylenes is presented with size&#8208;dependent photophysical properties. The  K&#8208;region of pyrene was functionalized with ethylene glycol groups to decorate the outer rim and thereby confine the space inside the macrocycle. This confined space is especially pronounced for&#160;n&#160;=&#160;5, which leads to an internal binding of up to 8.0&#215;10  4&#160;m  &#8211;1  between the ether&#8208;decorated [5]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylene and shape complementary crown ether&#8211;cation complexes. Both, the ether&#8208;decorated [n]cyclo&#8208;pyrenylenes as well as one of their host&#8211;guest complexes have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In combination with computational methods the structural and thermodynamic reasons for the exceptionally strong binding have been elucidated. The presented rim confinement strategy makes cycloparaphenylenes an attractive supramolecular host family with a favorable, size&#8208;independent read&#8208;out signature and binding capabilities extending beyond fullerene guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Allenylidene Induced 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement of Indole&#8208;Boronates: Diastereoselective Access to Highly Substituted Indolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of electrophile, Cu&#8211;allenylidene has been introduced to induce 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Merger of Cu&#8208;catalyzed propargylation and 1,2&#8208;boronate shift has allowed access to densely functionalized chiral indolines with up to three contiguous stereogenic centres in highly diastereoselective fashion (&gt;20:1 dr). Utility of Bpin and alkyne moieties has been demonstrated by subsequent synthetic elaborations.







Abstract
A process to achieve 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of indole boronate as a way to access substituted indolines in high diastereoselectivities is presented. The reaction involves the generation of a Cu&#8211;allenylidene, which is sufficiently electrophilic to induce the 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. The scope of the reaction is evaluated as well as further transformations of the product.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of electrophile, Cu&#8211;allenylidene has been introduced to induce 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Merger of Cu&#8208;catalyzed propargylation and 1,2&#8208;boronate shift has allowed access to densely functionalized chiral indolines with up to three contiguous stereogenic centres in highly diastereoselective fashion (&amp;gt;20:1 &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt;). Utility of Bpin and alkyne moieties has been demonstrated by subsequent synthetic elaborations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process to achieve 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of indole boronate as a way to access substituted indolines in high diastereoselectivities is presented. The reaction involves the generation of a Cu&#8211;allenylidene, which is sufficiently electrophilic to induce the 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. The scope of the reaction is evaluated as well as further transformations of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Beyond Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphines are notorious in acting exclusively as terminal donors, binding a single metal center. We have discovered that a non&#8208;traditional scenario is possible where the phosphorus(III) atom of a R3P ligand bridges three metal atoms at once. Such triply bridging pattern is first observed in the [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes, which also exhibit remarkable luminescence properties.







Abstract
The first example of a triply bridging (&#956;3&#8208;P) phosphine ligand has been discovered in the crown&#8208;shaped [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes supported by tris[2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethyl]phosphine (L). Theoretical analysis completely confirms the observed &#956;3&#8208;P&#8208;bridging pattern, revealing the interaction of the same lone pair of phosphorus with three valence 4s&#8208;orbitals of Cu atoms. The presented complexes exhibit outstanding blue phosphorescence (&#955;em=442&#8211;465&#8197;nm) with the quantum efficiency reaching 100&#8201;%. The complex [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;I)3L] also exhibits remarkable thermo&#8208; and mechanochromic luminescence resulting in a sharp change in the emission colour upon external stimuli. These findings essentially contribute to coordination chemistry of the pnictine ligands.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NaClO4/NaOTF electrolyte was designed for aqueous Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs). The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing NaF&#8211;Na2O&#8211;NaOH forming on the anode extended the cathodic limiting potential of electrolyte to 1.6&#8197;V, and the hydrophobic anions extend the anodic to 4.4&#8197;V. A 1.75&#8197;V Na3V2(PO4)3&#8741;Na3V2(PO4)3 cell achieved a high energy density of 70&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 87.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISE) have largely widened the electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes by formation of passivating solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and also absorption of the hydrophobic anion&#8208;rich double layer on cathode. However, the cathodic limiting potential of WISE is still too high for most high&#8208;capacity anodes in aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs), and the cost of WISE is also too high for practical application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost 19&#8197;m (m: mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) bi&#8208;salts WISE with a wide ESW of 2.8&#8197;V was designed, where the low&#8208;cost 17&#8197;m NaClO4 extends the anodic limiting potential to 4.4&#8197;V, while the fluorine&#8208;containing salt (2&#8197;m NaOTF) extends the cathodic limiting potential to 1.6&#8197;V by forming the NaF&#8211;Na2O&#8211;NaOH SEI on anode. The 19&#8197;m NaClO4&#8211;NaOTF&#8211;H2O electrolyte enables a 1.75&#8197;V Na3V2(PO4)3&#8741;Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell to deliver an appreciable energy density of 70&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C with a capacity retention of 87.5&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

         <title>When Fluxionality Beats Size Selection: Acceleration of Ostwald Ripening of Sub&#8208;Nano Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For supported nanoclusters at typical catalytic temperatures, Ostwald ripening is strongly accelerated by structural fluxionality, even in the regime of cluster size&#8208;selection. Hence, a revision of the theory of Ostwald ripening is proposed.







Abstract
Size selection was demonstrated to suppress Ostwald ripening of supported catalytic nanoparticles. When the supported clusters are subnanometer in size and highly fluxional, such as Pt clusters on the rutile TiO2(110) surface, this paradigm breaks down, and the established theory of sintering needs a revision. At temperatures characteristic of catalysis (i.e. 700&#8197;K), sub&#8208;nano clusters thermally populate many low&#8208;energy metastable isomers. As these isomers all have different geometric and electronic structures, and thus, formation and dissociation energies (in lieu of surface energy), Ostwald ripening is not suppressed, despite the size&#8208;selection. However, some clusters arise as magic numbers in terms of sintering stability at the ensemble level. Acceleration of sintering by metastable species persists though weakens in polydisperse cluster systems. We propose a competing pathways theory for sintering, which at the atomistic level describes the found size&#8208;specific sintering behavior.

         <title>Design of Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Cr2O3 Spheres for Metabolic Fingerprinting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres displayed strong photo&#8208;response for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites, thereby enabling fast and sensitive metabolic profiling in bio&#8208;fluids. Based on the decoded urine and serum metabolic fingerprints, we performed machine learning to discriminate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls with high specificity and selectivity.







Abstract
Schizophrenia (SZ) detection enables effective treatment to improve the clinical outcome, but objective and reliable SZ diagnostics are still limited. An ideal diagnosis of SZ suited for robust clinical screening must address detection throughput, low invasiveness, and diagnosis accuracy. Herein, we built a multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres (MHCSs) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) platform for the direct metabolic profiling of biofluids towards SZ diagnostics. The MHCSs displayed strong light absorption for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites. We profiled urine and serum metabolites (&#8776;1&#8197;&#956;L) with the enhanced LDI efficacy in seconds. We discriminated SZ patients (SZs) from healthy controls (HCs) with the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 1.000 for the blind test. We identified four compounds with optimal diagnostic power as a simplified metabolite panel for SZ and demonstrated the metabolite quantification for clinic use. Our approach accelerates the growth of new platforms toward a precision diagnosis in the near future.

         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides is presented. The reaction proceeds via the Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation. Preliminary studies on the rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond and detailed DFT studies on the mechanism are also provided.







Abstract
Although the construction of axially chiral C&#8722;C bonds leading to the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls and allied compounds are well&#8208;known, the related synthesis of compounds bearing axially chiral C&#8722;N bonds are relatively rare. Described herein is the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides. The NHC involved intermolecular Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation afforded N&#8208;aryl succinimides in good yields and ee values. Preliminary studies on rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond, the temperature dependence, and detailed DFT studies on mechanism are also provided.

         <title>Human oxygenase variants employing a single protein Fe(II) ligand are catalytically active</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aspartate/asparagine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (AspH) is a human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II) oxygenase that catalyzes C3 hydroxylations of aspartate/asparagine residues of epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domains (EGFDs). Unusually, AspH employs two histidine residues to chelate Fe(II) rather than the typical triad of two histidine and one glutamate/aspartate residue. We report kinetic, inhibition, and crystallographic studies concerning human AspH variants in which either of its Fe(II) binding histidine residues are substituted for alanine. Both the H725A and, in particular, the H679A AspH variant retain substantial catalytic activity. Crystal structures clearly reveal metal&#8208;ligation by only a single protein histidine ligand. The results have implications for the functional assignment of 2OG oxygenases and for the design of non&#8208;protein biomimetic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Activated In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting AIE Photosensitizer for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maximization of phototoxic damage on tumor with minimized side effect on normal tissue is essential for effective anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). This requires highly cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific or even cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;organelle&#8208;specific synthesis or delivery of efficient photosensitizers (PSs)  in vitro  and  in vivo  , which is difficult to achieve. Herein, we report a strategy of cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;activated PS synthesis, by which an efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) feature can be selectively synthesized as an efficient image&#8208;guided PDT agent inside cancer cells. MOF&#8208;199, a Cu(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework, was selected as an inert carrier to load the PS precursors for efficient delivery and served as a Cu(I) catalyst source for  in&#8208;situ  click reaction to form PSs exclusively in cancer cells. The  in&#8208;situ  synthesized PS showed mitochondria&#8208;targeting capability, allowing potent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific ablation under light irradiation. The high specificity of PSs produced in cancer cells also makes it safer post&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Single Diamond Surface Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological scaffolds with hyperbolic surfaces, especially single gyroid and single diamond structures, have sparked immense interest for creating novel materials due to their extraordinary physical properties. However, the ability of nature to create these unbalanced surfaces has not been achieved in either lyotropic liquid crystals or block copolymer phases due to their thermodynamical instability in these systems.&#160;Here, we report the synthesis of a porous silica scaffold with a single diamond surface structure fabricated by self&#8208;assembly of the poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;  b  &#8208;polystyrene&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(  L  &#8208;lactide) and silica precursors in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water. The single diamond structure with tetrahedral interconnected frameworks was revealed by the electron crystallographic reconstruction. We assume that the formation of single networks is induced by the order&#8208;order phase transition through double diamond/single gyroid structures and related to the energetic change due to the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature. This work may provide new insights into these biologically relevant surfaces and related self&#8208;assembly systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Acid&#8208;Assisted Hydrogenation of Oximes to Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We found that cyclometalated cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complexes are uniquely efficient catalysts in homogeneous hydrogenation of oximes to hydroxylamine products. A stable iridium C,N&#8208;chelation is crucial, with alkoxy&#8208;substituted aryl ketimine ligands providing the best catalytic performance. Several Ir&#8208;complexes were mapped by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis in order to collect steric parameters that might guide a rational design of even more active catalysts. A broad range of oximes and oxime ethers were activated with stoichiometric amounts of methanesulfonic acid and reduced at room temperature, remarkably without cleavage of the fragile N&#8208;O bond. The exquisite functional group compatibility of our hydrogenation system was further demonstrated by additive tests. Experimental mechanistic investigations support an ionic hydrogenation platform, and suggest a role for the Br&#248;nsted acid beyond a proton source. Our studies provide deep understanding of this novel acidic hydrogenation and may facilitate its improvement and application to other challenging substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Electric Directional Anisotropy in Polar Soft Ferromagnets of Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) are attracting interest due to their structural tunability and rich functional characteristics, such as ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. Here, we report the chiral&#8208;polar ferromagnetic 2D&#8208;OIHP copper chlorides with discernable electric polarization in the inorganic layers. In these systems, the magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation has been clearly observed by measuring a magneto&#8208;electric directional anisotropy (MEA), in which an optical absorption coefficient changes with reversal of the light propagating direction. We have found that the MEA can be induced by a low magnetic field of ~50 mT, reflecting soft magnetic nature. The present results suggest a new paradigm for designing functional ME multiferroics, which effectively couples magnetic and electric properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetically Engineered Polypeptide Adhesive Coacervates for Surgical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adhesive hydrogels have been developed for wound healing applications. However, their adhesive performance is impaired dramatically due to their high swelling on wet tissues. To tackle this challenge, we fabricated a new type of non&#8208;swelling protein adhesive for underwater and  in vivo  applications. In this soft material, the electrostatic complexation between supercharged polypeptides with oppositely charged surfactants containing 3,4&#8208;dihydroxylphenylalanine or azobenzene moieties plays an important role for the formation of ultra&#8208;strong adhesive coacervates. Remarkably, the adhesion capability is superior to commercial cyanoacrylate when tested in ambient conditions. Moreover, the adhesion is stronger than other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives in underwater environment. The&#160;ex vivo  and  in vivo  experiments demonstrate the persistent adhesive performance and outstanding behaviors for wound sealing and healing. Thus, this new type of genetically engineered adhesive coacervates is a very promising alternative for surgical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the unprecedented stereochemistry of an enzymatic nitrile synthesis through a combined computational and experimental approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic  E&#8208; and  Z&#8208;aldoximes with formation of both opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising  in silico  mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave a detailed insight why with the same enzyme the use of racemic  E&#8208; and  Z&#8208;aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with an increased and decreased cavity in the active site have then been prepared and used in biotransformations, showed the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses. This validated model also enabled the rational design of mutants with a decreased size of the cavity, which gave superior enantioselectivities compared to the known wild&#8208;type enzyme with excellent E&#8208;values of up to E&gt;200 when utilizing the mutant OxdRE&#8208;Leu145Phe.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;In&#8208;Conjugation&#8208;Boosted Organic Semiconductor Gas Sensors Work at High Temperature and Immune to Moisture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrical gas sensors have been developed for many decades because of their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, their industrialization is severely hindered by their intrinsic humidity susceptibility and poor recovery. Conventional organic sensory materials can only operate at room temperature owing to their weak intermolecular interactions. In this work, we demonstrate that the concept of ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation enables organic gas sensors to operate at 100 &#176;C and 70% relative humidity (RH) with almost complete recovery using a coronate polymer (poly&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;biphenylcroconate) as a prototype material for detecting nitric dioxide (NO  2  ). The fabricated sensor has a lower detection limit at the parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) level, while affording the highest sensitivity (2526 ppm  &#8208;1  at 40 ppb) compared with those of all other reported NO  2  chemresistive sensors. In addition, the in&#8208;situ sum&#8208;frequency generation spectra (SFG) at room temperature and 100 &#176;C reveal that charge transfer increases with temperature. Theoretic calculations and in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) confirm the ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8208;inspired hydrogen bond as key for excellent sensitivity. A NO  2  alarm system operating under the atmosphere is assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensor. This study demonstrates ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation as a promising concept for designing a robust gas sensor and provides a foundation for the practical application of organic gas sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable acidic water oxidation with a cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide catalyst operating via a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability and expense of anodes for water electrolyzers with acidic electrolytes can be overcome through the implementation of the cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide electrocatalyst, [Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Pb]Ox, that is self&#8208;healing in the presence of dissolved metal precursors. However, the latter requirement is pernicious for the membrane and especially the cathode half&#8208;reaction since Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors poison the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum H2 evolving catalyst. To address this, we demonstrate the invariably stable operation of [Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Pb]Ox in acidic solutions through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism without the addition of Pb2+ and Fe3+ and investigate the kinetics of the process. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that low concentrations of Co2+ in the solution stabilize the catalytically active Co(Fe) sites. The highly promising performance of this system is showcased by steady water electrooxidation at 80&#160;&#176;C and 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, using a flat electrode, at an overpotential of 0.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.01 V on a one&#8208;week timescale.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplified Interfacial Effect on Atomically Dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd 2D Inverse Nanocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed oxide&#8208;on&#8208;metal inverse nanocatalysts provide a practicable blueprint to amplify the strong oxide&#8208;metal interactions for heterocatalysis but remain a grand challenge in fabrication. Here we report a 2D inverse nanocatalyst, named RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets, by in&#8208;situ creating atomically dispersed RuOx/Pd interfaces densely on ultrathin Pd nanosheets via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The products deliver unexpected performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline, which represents 8.0&#8208; and 22.4&#8208;fold enhancements in mass activity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively, showcasing an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations validate that the RuOx/Pd interfaces can accumulate partial charge from the 2D Pd hosts and subtly change the adsorption configuration of O2 to facilitate the O&#8211;O bond fracture. Meanwhile, the d&#8208;band center of Pd nanosubstrates is factually down&#8208;shifted for weakening the oxygen binding strength, tandemly motivating the excellent ORR catalysis on the RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable lithium&#8208;metal battery achieved by a safe electrolyte based on recyclable and low&#8208;cost molecular sieve</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one typical clean&#8208;energy technologies, lithium&#8208;metal batteries, especially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental&#8208;unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially&#8208;available low&#8208;cost and environmental&#8208;friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium&#8208;ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF  6  &#8208;EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Inspiringly, the new&#8208;designed electrolyte exhibited largely enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation stability under high&#8208;voltage (4.6 volts) and elevated temperature (55  o  C). NCM&#8208;811//Li cells assembled with this electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;stable rechargeabilities (over 1000 cycles for half&#8208;cell; 300 cycles for pouch&#8208;cell). More importantly, sustainable NCM&#8208;811//Li pouch&#8208;cell with negligible capacity decay can also be obtained through using recyclable zeolite sieved electrolyte. This conceptually&#8208;new way in preparing safe and highly&#8208;efficient electrolyte by using low&#8208;price molecular sieve would accelerate the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>The cytochrome P450 catalyzing C&#8208;S bond formation in S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial sulfur&#8208;containing secondary metabolites show various biological activities and the C&#8208;S bond&#8208;forming in their biosynthetic metabolism has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we present genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CxnD exhibiting C&#8208;S bond forming activity&#160;in  S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.  In vivo  and  in&#160;vitro  analyses demonstrated that CxnD generated an indole&#8208;fused dihydrothiopyran skeleton from a  L&#8208;Trp&#8208;derived thiol&#160;intermediate. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CxnD in complex with a substrate analogue and structure&#8208;based mutagenesis revealed intimate details of the substrate binding mode. A radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group&#160;of the substrate was proposed for CxnD, which provided valuable insights into the molecular basis for the intra&#8208;molecular C(sp2)&#8208;H thiolation by the P450 in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing interfacial electronic effects on single&#8208;molecule adsorption geometry and electron transport at atomically&#8208;flat surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clarifying interfacial electronic effects on molecular adsorption is of great significance in many chemical and biochemical processes but remains a challenge. Here, we have successfully used STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy technique to probe electron transport and adsorption geometries of pyridyl molecules at Au(111). Modifying Au(111) surface with 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation&#8208;containing ionic liquids (ILs) decreases surface electron density and stabilizes a vertical orientation of pyridine through nitrogen atom &#963;&#8208;bond interactions, resulting in uniform adsorption configurations for forming molecular junctions. Furthermore, fine modulation from vertical, tilted, to flat, is achieved on adding water to ILs, leading to a new peak around 1633 cm  &#8208;1  ascribed to CC stretching mode of adsorbed pyridyl ring and 316% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance. Combining with DFT calculation reveals that the dihedral angle between adsorbed pyridyl ring and surface decreases with increasing surface electronic density, which enhances electron&#8208;donation from surface to pyridyl ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Switches Regulated by Post&#8208;Transition/Transition Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural transition metal ions: Post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions can induce, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. We exploited such property for elaborating fluorescent aptamer probes that switch between inert, metal ion&#8208;complexed and active, target&#8208;bound states. This very simple structural switching strategy was applied to the homogeneous&#8208;phase detection of small organics using diversely structured aptamers.







Abstract
We introduced an aptamer switch design that relies on the ability of post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions to trigger, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. In the absence of molecular target, the addition of one such metal ion to usual aptamer working solutions promotes the formation of an alternative, inert DNA state. Upon exposure to the cognate compound, the equilibrium is shifted towards the competent DNA form. The switching process was preferentially activated by metal ions of intermediate base over phosphate complexation preference (i.e. Pb2+, Cd2+) and operated with diversely structured DNA molecules. This very simple aptamer switch scheme was applied to the detection of small organics using the fluorescence anisotropy readout mode. We envision that the approach could be adapted to a variety of signalling methods that report on changes in the surface charge density of DNA receptors.

         <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Determination of Hydride Locations in Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep covolutional neural networks, trained on existing examples with known hydride locations from neutron diffraction, were able to accurately predict hydride locations given an X&#8208;ray structure of copper&#8208;hydride nanoclusters, thereby relieving the need of neutron diffraction.







Abstract
Although the coordinates of the metal atoms can be accurately determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, locations of hydrides in metal nanoclusters are challenging to determine. In principle, neutron crystallography can be employed to pinpoint the hydride positions, but it requires a large crystal and a neutron source, which prevents its routine use. Here, we present a deep&#8208;learning approach that can accelerate determination of hydride locations in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of metal nanoclusters of different sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in predicting the most probable hydride sites and their combinations to determine the total structure for two recently reported copper nanoclusters, [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3&#8722; and [Cu61(StBu)26S6Cl6H14]+ whose hydride locations have not been determined by neutron diffraction. Our method can be generalized and applied to other metal systems, thereby eliminating a bottleneck in atomically precise metal hydride nanochemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward preparation of photochromic siloles based on the dithienylethene motif is developed. It relies upon an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of a 2,3&#8208;bis(3&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;silirene with terminal alkynes in mild conditions. The reaction is functional group&#8208;tolerant and can be performed in high yields with a variety of functional terminal alkynes.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Nano&#8208;Crystallization and Solvation Modulation to Promote Highly Stable Anode Involving Alloy/De&#8208;alloy for Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ nano&#8208;crystallization well ease volume exchange of the hierarchical particle and a stable and robust SEI formed on the particle enable (BiO)2CO3 based electrode a highly stable cycling performance during 1500&#8197;cycles, providing a new sight for anode materials design and an understanding about the relationship between solvation and SEI formation.







Abstract

         <title>Molecular Origin of Blood&#8208;based Infrared Spectroscopic Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared spectroscopy of liquid biopsies is a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective approach that may advance biomedical diagnostics. However, molecular nature of disease&#8208;related changes of infrared molecular fingerprints (IMFs) remains poorly understood, impeding the method&#8217;s applicability. Here we probe 148 human blood sera and reveal the origin of the variations in their IMFs. To that end, we supplemented infrared spectroscopy with biochemical fractionation and proteomic profiling, providing molecular information about serum composition. Using lung cancer as an example for a medical condition, we demonstrate that the disease&#8208;related differences in IMFs are dominated by contributions from twelve highly abundant proteins &#8208; that, if used as a pattern, may be instrumental for detecting malignancy. Tying proteomic to spectral information and machine learning advances our understanding of infrared spectra of liquid biopsies, a framework that could be applied to probing of any disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Temperature Aqueous Battery with Proton Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional aqueous batteries usually suffer from serious capacity loss under subzero conditions due to the freeze of electrolytes. To realize the utilization of aqueous batteries in extremely cold climates, low&#8208;temperature aqueous battery systems have to be developed. Herein, an aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on p&#8208;chloranil/reduced graphene oxide (PCHL&#8208;rGO) in H2SO4 electrolyte is developed. Such aqueous Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries display H+ insertion chemistry, which endow the batteries with fast reaction kinetics and high rate capability. In addition, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be significantly damaged in electrolyte by modulating the interaction between SO42&#8208; and water molecules, lowering the freezing point of electrolyte. As a result, the Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries deliver extraordinary electrochemical performance even at &#8208;70 &#176;C. This work will broaden the horizons of aqueous batteries and open up new opportunities to construct low&#8208;temperature aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Red Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox method was developed for fabrication of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs). Cysteine was responsible for assembly of the RPNSs, and the addition of acetylacetonate enabled the construction of doped RPNSs. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results confirmed that native RPNSs induce drastic autophagy in tumor chemotherapy.







Abstract
Among phosphorus&#8208;based nanomaterials, layered black phosphorus and violet phosphorus have been actively explored in the past decade. However, methods for the synthesis of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs) is lacking, even though red phosphorus (RP) is commercially available at low cost and has excellent chemical stability at room temperature. We report an efficient strategy for fabrication of RPNSs and doped RPNSs using cysteine as a reducing reagent. Data from in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies suggested that RPNSs can trigger production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and subsequent autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death in a shape&#8208;dependent manner. Our findings provide a method for construction of layered RP nanomaterials and they present a unique mechanism for the application of phosphorus&#8208;based materials in nanomedicines.

         <title>Compression&#8208;Driven Internanocluster Reaction for Synthesis of Unconventional Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compression&#8208;driven internanocluster reaction in the solid state of Au25 was firstly demonstrated by introducing high pressure technology and a novel unconventional NC Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 was obtained. Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 NC consists of a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, which has not been previously reported and endows it with enhanced photoluminescence.







Abstract
Can the active kernels in ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) react with one another, or can the internanocluster reaction occur when they are in close enough proximity? To resolve this fundamental issue, we investigated the solid&#8208;state internanocluster reaction of the most studied gold NC Au25(SR)18 (SR: thiolate). A novel NC was produced by increasing the pressure to 5&#8197;GPa, whose composition was determined to be Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 by mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. As revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, the structure, a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, has not been reported and endows the NC with obvious photoluminescence. DFT calculations indicate that the staples contribute substantially to the absorption properties. Further experiments reveal the pressure (internanocluster distance) can tune the internanocluster reaction, and the resulting product is not necessarily the thermodynamic product.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Interaction Modulation in Porous Coordination Polymers for Inverse Selective CO2/C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity is achieved through precise steric design of amino groups in the pore surface to provide enhanced CO2&#8211;framework interactions and suppressed C2H2 adsorption. The obtained two new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) exhibit high CO2 uptake and strong separation performance for one&#8208;step C2H2 purification at room temperature, which can be considered as new physisorbents with this specific inverse selectivity.







Abstract
Controlling gas sorption by simple pore modification is important in molecular recognition and industrial separation processes. In particular, it is challenging to realize the inverse selectivity, which reduces the adsorption of a high&#8208;affinity gas and increases the adsorption of a low&#8208;affinity gas. Herein, an &#8220;opposite action&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for boosting CO2/C2H2 selectivity in porous coordination polymers (PCPs). A precise steric design of channel pores using an amino group as an additional interacting site enabled the synergetic increase in CO2 adsorption while suppressing the C2H2 adsorption. Based on this strategy, two new ultramicroporous PCP physisorbents that are isostructural were synthesised. They exhibited the highest CO2 uptake and CO2/C2H2 volume uptake ratio at 298&#8197;K. Origin of this specific selectivity was verified by detailed density functional theory calculations. The breakthrough separation performances with remarkable stability and recyclability of both the PCPs render them relevant materials for C2H2 purification from CO2/C2H2 mixtures.

Herein, an &#8220;opposite action&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for boosting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity in porous coordination polymers (PCPs). A precise steric design of channel pores using an amino group as an additional interacting site enabled the synergetic increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption while suppressing the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. Based on this strategy, two new ultramicroporous PCP physisorbents that are isostructural were synthesised. They exhibited the highest CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; volume uptake ratio at 298&#8197;K. Origin of this specific selectivity was verified by detailed density functional theory calculations. The breakthrough separation performances with remarkable stability and recyclability of both the PCPs render them relevant materials for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; purification from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A so&#8208;called &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; program has been developed to foresee and predict the yield and stereoselectivity of glycosylation reactions based on the properties of various donors, acceptors, activation systems and solvents. The program statistically analyzes and compares the relative reactivity value (RRV) of donors and the acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) of acceptors.







Abstract
The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We have developed a database of acceptor nucleophilic constants (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithms. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well&#8208;defined reactivity and promoters were organized and processed by the designed software program &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; for prediction of glycosylation reactions without involving sophisticated computational processing. The importance of Aka was further verified by random forest algorithm, and the applicability was tested by the synthesis of a Lewis A skeleton to show that the stereoselectivity and yield can be accurately estimated.

Abstract
A one&#8208;step synthetic pathway for the preparation of fully conjugated &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;azaDIPY hybrid chromophores comprised of &#946;&#8208;isoindigo and azadipyrromethene moieties is reported. The target compounds were characterized by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and theoretical methods and show unprecedented broad absorption across the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the octa(n&#8208;butyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;azaDIPY derivative revealed that a trans&#8208;configuration of the &#946;&#8208;isoindigo fragment accompanies a planar conjugated core.

         <title>Asymmetric Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydrosilylation/Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes is developed to access synthetically versatile chiral alkylsilanes with a catalyst generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and (R,Sp)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of 1,6&#8208;enynes react to afford the corresponding alkylsilanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
We report an enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with secondary and tertiary hydrosilanes employing a catalyst generated in situ from the combination of Co(acac)2 and (R,Sp)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and carbon&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes reacted with Ph2SiH2, (EtO)3SiH, or (RO)2MeSiH to afford the corresponding chiral organosilane products in high yields and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. This cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization also occurred with prochiral secondary hydrosilane PhMeSiH2 to yield chiral alkylsilanes containing both carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity, albeit with modest diastereoselectivity. The chiral organosilane products from this cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation/cyclization could be converted to a variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds by stereospecific conversion of their C&#8722;Si and Si&#8722;H bonds without loss of enantiopurity.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Adjustable Correlated Color Temperature Guided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the guidance of machine learning, the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT (CIE coordinates) of 3107&#8197;K (0.48, 0.51), 4071&#8197;K (0.37, 0.37), and 4548&#8197;K (0.36, 0.36), and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5106&#8197;K (0.34, 0.37), 5632&#8197;K (0.33, 0.33), and 6034&#8197;K (0.32, 0.35) were obtained accurately.







Abstract
Here, we show the fabrication of the carbon dots (CDs) with green and orange emissions from PTCDA (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride). Using these CDs as emitters, the orange (or green) CDs LEDs were fabricated, which show electroluminescence (EL) spectra centered at 560&#8197;nm (or 498&#8197;nm) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.98&#8201;% (1.76&#8201;%) adhering a luminescence of 626&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (or 519&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2). The machine learning was successfully used to predict PL CCT value. With the model, the white photoluminescence (PL) emission with adjustable correlated color temperature (CCT) from 3093 to 11018&#8197;K via combining blue, green, and orange CDs was achieved. Then, we obtained the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT of 3107, 4071 and 4548&#8197;K, and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5632 (CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), EQE: 1.18&#8201;%, luminescence: 598&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2) and 6034&#8197;K accurately.

         <title>Highly &#947;&#8208;Selective Arylation and Carbonylative Arylation of 3&#8208;Bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene via Nickel Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly &#947;&#8208;regioselective arylation and carbonylation of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene has been developed. The reaction provides a variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with good functional group tolerance and high efficiency. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that both non&#8208;radical and radical pathways are possible for the reaction.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly &#947;&#8208;regioselective arylation and carbonylative arylation of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, providing the gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The resulting gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes can serve as versatile building blocks for diversified synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that both non&#8208;radical and radical pathways are possible for the reaction, and the radical pathway is more likely. The high &#947;&#8208;regioselectivity results from the &#946;&#8208;bromide elimination of alkylnickel(II) species or from the reductive elimination of nickel(III) species [(aryl)(CF2=CHCH2)NiIII(Ln)X]. The &#947;&#8208;selective carbonylation of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene under 1&#8197;atm CO gas also provides a new way for nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Making Strong Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages and drawbacks of strategies that generate strong graphene materials by eliminating the voids between the graphene platelets and the wrinkling of the graphene platelets are discussed in this Minireview. The fundamental mechanical properties and the wide&#8208;ranging electrical and magnetic properties of the resulting materials are also discussed.







Abstract
Graphene materials have been widely applied in various fields because of their remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, two obstacles arise during the assembly of graphene platelets into macroscale graphene materials and composites that impair the performance of the resultant graphene materials: 1)&#8197;the voids between the graphene platelets, and 2)&#8197;the wrinkling of the graphene platelets. In the past decade, several strategies have been developed to eliminate these obstacles. These strategies result in strong macroscale graphene materials, such as graphene fibers with tensile strengths of over 3.4&#8197;GPa and sheets with tensile strengths of over 1.5&#8197;GPa, which have many practical applications. This Minireview summarizes the effective strategies for assembling graphene materials and compares their advantages and drawbacks. The preparation processes as well as the resulting fundamental mechanical properties and wide spectrum of electrical and magnetic properties are also discussed. Finally, our outlook for the future of this field is presented.

         <title>Unravelling the Fast Alkali&#8208;Ion Dynamics in Paramagnetic Battery Materials Combined with NMR and Deep&#8208;Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unambiguous assignment of chemical shift in paramagnetic battery materials relies on first&#8208;principles calculation, while the state&#8208;of&#8208;art computational methodology is limited in sluggish dynamic systems. We incorporate hundreds of nanoseconds deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to expanding the ssNMR application in high&#8208;rate cathode materials.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) has received extensive attention in characterizing alkali&#8208;ion battery materials because it is highly sensitive for probing the local environment and dynamic information of atoms/ions. However, precise spectral assignment cannot be carried out by conventional DFT for high&#8208;rate battery materials at room temperature. Herein, combining DFT calculation of paramagnetic shift and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to achieve the converged Na+ distribution at hundreds of nanoseconds, we obtain the statistically averaged paramagnetic shift, which is in excellent agreement with ssNMR measurements. Two 23Na shifts induced by different stacking sequences of transition metal layers are revealed in the fast chemically exchanged NMR spectra of P2&#8208;type Na2/3(Mg1/3Mn2/3)O2 for the first time. This DPMD simulation auxiliary protocol can be beneficial to a wide range of ssNMR analysis in fast chemically exchanged material systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Noncovalently Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions and End&#8208;Group Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a series of noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions. Combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were achieved.







Abstract
Noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their advantages of simple synthetic routes, high yields and low costs. However, the efficiencies of NFREAs based organic solar cells (OSCs) are still far behind those of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Herein, a series of NFREAs with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions were designed and synthesized with a two&#8208;step synthetic route. Upon introducing &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;groups into the backbones, the electronic properties, charge transport, film morphology, and energy loss were precisely tuned by fine&#8208;tuning the degree of multi&#8208;fluorination. As a result, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were obtained. This contribution demonstrated that combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering is a simple and effective way to explore high&#8208;performance NFREAs.

         <title>Tailoring a Dynamic Metal&#8211;Polymer Interaction to Improve Catalyst Selectivity and Longevity in Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of polymers with similar framework structures but different metal&#8208;ligating functionalities as supports for Pd catalysts to control the dynamic metal&#8211;polymer interactions (DMPI) and catalytic properties. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface via DMPI, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation.







Abstract
Controlling metal&#8211;support interactions is important for tuning the catalytic properties of supported metal catalysts. Here, premade Pd particles are supported on stable polymers containing different ligating functionalities to control the metal&#8211;polymer interactions and their catalytic properties in industrially relevant acetylene partial hydrogenation. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;SH and Ar&#8208;S&#8208;Ar) can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation. In contrast, polymers with weakly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;O&#8208;Ar) do not form an overlayer, resulting in non&#8208;selective hydrogenation and fast deactivation, similar to Pd catalysts on conventional inorganic supports. The results imply that tuning the metal&#8211;polymer interactions via rational polymer design can provide an efficient way of synthesizing selective and stable catalysts for hydrogenation.

         <title>Reversible Micrometer&#8208;Scale Spiral Self&#8208;Assembly in Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Film with Controllable Chiral Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with clear handedness are obtained through self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(methyl methacrylate) bearing azobenzene mesogen side chains, with the aid of enantiopure tartaric acid as chiral additive. The formation of spiral structures can be reversibly controlled by ultraviolet light and heat treatment.







Abstract
The spiral is a fundamental structure in nature and spiral structures with controllable handedness are of increasing interest in the design of new chiroptical materials. In this study, micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with reversible chirality were fabricated based on the assembly of a liquid crystalline block copolymer film assisted by enantiopure tartaric acid. Mechanistic insight revealed that the formation of the spiral structures was closely related to the liquid crystalline properties of the major phase of block copolymer under the action of chiral tartaric acid. The chiral spiral structures with controllable handedness were easily erased under ultraviolet light irradiation and restored via thermal annealing. This facile thermal treatment method provides guidance for fabrication of chiral micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with adjustable chiral properties.

         <title>Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Aggregation Modulated Twin Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, stable in air, from the simplest class of arylene diimides, i.e., pyromellitic diimides, is achieved. Aggregation modulated, colour tuneable phosphorescence emission from cyan to orange&#8208;red in amorphous film and crystalline state is observed. The role of molecular design and weak intermolecular interactions in the observed properties is explained.







Abstract
Arylene diimide derived ambient organic phosphors are seldom reported despite their potential structural characteristics to facilitate the triplet harvesting. In this context, highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from simple, heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide derivatives in amorphous matrix and crystalline state is reported here. Multiple intermolecular halogen bonding interactions among these phosphors, such as halogen&#8208;carbonyl and halogen&#8208;&#960; resulted in the modulation of phosphorescence, cyan emission from monomeric state and orange&#8208;red emission from its aggregated state, to yield twin RTP emission. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable phosphorescence presented here own one of the highest quantum yield (&#8776;48&#8201;%) among various organics in orange&#8208;red emissive region.

         <title>Designing a Single Protein&#8208;Chain Reporter for Opioid Detection at Cellular Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for detecting opioid molecules is reported by Kayla E. Kroning and Wenjing Wang in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101262). These opioid&#8208;sensors are called SPOTIT (single&#8208;chain protein&#8208;based opioid transmission indicator tool). Upon detecting opioids, SPOTIT is activated and generates a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. SPOTIT, based on the mu&#8208;opioid receptor, showed an opioid&#8208;dependent fluorescence signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio up to 12.5 in HEK293T cell culture and up to 4.6 in primary neuron culture. SPOTIT will potentially be useful for high&#8208;throughput screening of opioids in cell cultures and cellular resolution detection of opioids in vivo.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular coordination cage in the center of a star&#8208;shaped water&#8208;soluble polymer responds to ultrasonication&#8208;induced shear force in solution. As reported by Robert G&#246;stl, Bernd&#8197;M. Schmidt in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102383), the octahedral Pd cage (blue panels) bearing polymer chains (red) on each vertex (metallic) encapsulates pharmaceutically active cargo within its hydrophobic nanocavity and is activated by sonication in aqueous solution entailing complete cargo release upon rupture.

         <title>Stereoselective Directed Cationic Cascades Enabled by Molecular Anchoring in Terpene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designed hydrogen bonds in the active site of terpene cyclases enable the direction of cationic cyclization cascades by molecular anchoring of a substrate's polar functional group. As a result, it is possible to replace multi&#8208;step synthetic routes by one enzymatic step and manufacture valuable apocarotenoids in a highly product&#8208; and stereoselective manner on a gram&#8208;scale, as reported by Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101228).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leucinostatins are fascinating natural substances, with high potency against many pathogens, but their acute toxicity has prevented therapeutic use. Michael Adams, Rainer Riedl et&#8197;al. demonstrate in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102153) how these could be converted into synthetically more accessible and more selective antiprotozoal agents with broad efficacy and undetectable resistance. This study has not only led to therapeutically applicable agents against parasites but also shows how peptides can be made clinically useful by targeted synthetic transformations.

         <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Single Layer Graphene/Electrolyte Interface: Effect of Solvent on the Interfacial Capacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Change of the potential of zero charge (pzc) of a single layer graphene (SLG) electrode in contact with EMI,TFSI ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte is reported by Yanwu Zhu, Patrice Simon in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202017057). The strong interactions between the SLG surface and the EMI+ cation (red) in neat ionic liquid is weakened in presence of acetonitrile solvent molecules (yellow), leading to a rise of the charge carrier density at the electrolyte/SLG interface and a positive shift of the pzc. This shows the importance of the local sp2 carbon organization on its capacitive behavior and electrochemical performance.

&lt;p&gt;Change of the potential of zero charge (pzc) of a single layer graphene (SLG) electrode in contact with EMI,TFSI ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte is reported by Yanwu Zhu, Patrice Simon in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202017057"&gt;10.1002/anie.202017057&lt;/a&gt;). The strong interactions between the SLG surface and the EMI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation (red) in neat ionic liquid is weakened in presence of acetonitrile solvent molecules (yellow), leading to a rise of the charge carrier density at the electrolyte/SLG interface and a positive shift of the pzc. This shows the importance of the local sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon organization on its capacitive behavior and electrochemical performance.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is developed to prepare superatomic nanoclusters in a controllable fashion of which an internal&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H)L6 leads to the formation of a highly emissive, two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10L8. Jean&#8208;Yves Saillard, Chen&#8208;Wei Liu et&#8197;al. explain in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100965) that the metal framework of Ag7 is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H)L6 acts as a both reducing agent and template in the cluster build&#8208;up.

         <dc:description>
Bicyclic peptidomimetics bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. A structure&#8208;based design strategy has been applied to minimize a 52 amino acid binding motif into bicyclic 16&#8208;mer &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics. The biologically most active mimetic exhibits robust cellular uptake and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay, as reported by Tom&#8197;N. Grossmann et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102082).

         <title>Defect Engineering in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Towards Advanced Mixed Matrix Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first demonstrate the deliberate introduction of defects in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be an additional degree of freedom towards highly permselective MOF/polymer mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs). The developed MMM materials based on our concept exhibit promising potential for industrial propylene/propane separation processes as well as universal applicability in other fields.







Abstract
Highly permselective and durable membrane materials have been sought for energy&#8208;efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) comprising a polymer matrix and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for this application; however, rational matching of filler&#8208;matrix is challenging and their separation performances need to be further improved. Here, we propose a novel strategy of &#8220;defect engineering&#8221; in MOFs as an additional degree of freedom to design advanced MMMs. MMMs incorporated with defect&#8208;engineered MOFs exhibit exceptionally high C3H6 permeability and maintained C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, especially with enhanced stability under industrial mixed&#8208;gas conditions. The gas transport, sorption, and material characterizations reveal that the defect sites in MOFs provide the resulting MMMs with not only ultrafast diffusion pathways but also favorable C3H6 sorption by forming complexation with unsaturated open metal sites, confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR studies. Most importantly, the concept is also valid for different polymer matrices and gas pairs, demonstrating its versatile potential in other fields.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Emissive Metallacages as Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages with high fluorescence quantum yield and good processability were prepared. These metallacages were further utilized as coatings of a blue light&#8208;emitting bulb to prepare white&#8208;light emitting diodes, demonstrating their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials.







Abstract
The construction of solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials with high quantum yield and good processability is of vital importance in the preparation of organic light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages are prepared by the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridylphenyl)ethylene, cis&#8208;Pt(PEt3)2(OTf)2 and tetracarboxylic ligands. These metallacages exhibit good emission both in solution and in the solid state because the coordination bonds and aggregation restrict the molecular motions of TPE synergistically, which suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of these metallacages. Impressively, one of the metallacages achieves very high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F=88.46&#8201;%) in the solid state, which is further used as the coatings of a blue LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. The study not only provides a general method to the preparation of TPE&#8208;based metallacages but also explores their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials, which will promote the future design and applications of metallacages as useful emissive devices.

         <title>Programmed synthesis of Hepta&#8208;Differentiated &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: 1 out of 117655 Arrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin remain limited. A thioacetate orienting group expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using DIBAL&#8208;H promoted debenzylation. This method allowed the synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. A random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin poly&#8208;functionalization has fueled progress in their use in multiple applications such as enzyme mimicry, but also in the polymer sciences, luminescence, as sensors or for biomedical applications. However, regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is still very limited. We uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, that expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL&#8208;H) promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy, opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.

However, regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is still very limited. We uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, that expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL&#8208;H) promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy, opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;release driven spirocyclization: The expedient and modular construction of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles harnessing the strain energy of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment is described. From easily accessible ABB&#8208;ketones, electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization gives access to a range of spiro&#8208;azetidines with varying functionalities and ring sizes.







Abstract
Due to their intrinsic rigidity, three&#8208;dimensionality and structural novelty, spirocyclic molecules have become increasingly sought&#8208;after moieties in drug discovery. Herein, we report a strain&#8208;release driven synthesis of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles by harnessing the inherent ring strain of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment. Novel ABB&#8208;ketone precursors bearing silyl&#8208;protected alcohols were synthesized in a single step and shown to engage in electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization&#8208;desilylation reactions. Primary, secondary and tertiary silyl ethers were effectively transformed into a library of new spiro&#8208;azetidines, with a range of substituents and ring sizes. In addition, the products are generated with synthetically useful ketone and protected&#8208;amine functional groups, which provides the potential for further elaboration and for this chemistry to be utilized in the rapid assembly of medicinally relevant compounds.
