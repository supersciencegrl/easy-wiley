         <title>Synthesis of an Sp&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Rich Carbonaceous Material Exhibiting Distinctive Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy to cleave two bonds, producing TMS&#8208;capped sp&#8208;carbon hybridized carbonaceous material (TMS&#8208;C) via coupling of trimethylsilylacetylene&#8208;protected acetylene. Ultra&#8208;long acetylene chains offer abundant Li storage sites, and the highly ordered crystalline structure enables near&#8208;theoretical capacity, delivering 3219&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. This work presents a promising route for carbyne synthesis and high&#8208;performance Li storage.








Abstract
Among carbon allotropes, carbyne, composed solely of sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms, has garnered significant interest due to its potential unique physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the synthesis of carbyne or its analogs remains a persistent challenge, hindering further exploration in this area. Herein, a straightforward synthesis method is proposed to prepare TMS&#8208;capped sp&#8208;carbon hybridized carbonaceous material (TMS&#8208;C). Trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) with two types of bond&#8208;cleaving spots was used as the precursor to obtain TMS&#8208;C via a one&#8208;pot coupling reaction. TMS not only inhibits side reactions but can also be cleaved to generate reaction intermediates participating in subsequent coupling reactions via a copper catalyst. The as&#8208;synthesized TMS&#8208;C contains conjugated linear acetylene bonds composed of over 92 continuous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Due to the large amount of sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms, the lithium (Li)&#8208;ion half&#8208;cell prepared based on TMS&#8208;C delivered an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 3219&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, and at a high current density of 5000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, it can be stably cycled 8865 times. Our results reveal immense promise for developing methodologies capable of cutting multiple types of bonds within a single reaction system for the synthesis of carbyne&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Operando XAFS Reveals Dynamic Structural Evolution of Pt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Chlorine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando XAFS elucidated structure&#8211;activity relationships in single&#8208;atom catalysts for chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Divergent catalyst&#8208;Cl intermediate interactions under CER conditions were observed on the PtN4 site and the low&#8208;coordinated Pt site. The latter exhibited higher *Cl coverage than that of PtN4 site, shifting the traditional rate&#8208;determining step from that on PtN4 site to the Heyrovsk&#253; step and improving CER activity.








Abstract
Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with near&#8208;100% metal utilization and flexible coordination environments are promising candidates for electrochemical chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to produce valuable Cl2&#8212;a key raw material for plastics manufacturing, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals. However, it remains challenging to assess specific coordination environments for structure&#8211;activity relationships and monitor their dynamic structural evolution under catalytic reaction conditions. Herein, operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) revealed distinct dynamic structural evolution on the low&#8208;coordinated Pt site, compared to the conventional PtN4 site. Specifically, the low&#8208;coordinated Pt site transformed into an asymmetry PtN2Cl2 structure upon exposure to a Cl&#8722;&#8208;containing solution, transiently evolved to PtN2Cl4 intermediate at low overpotentials, and reverted to PtN2Cl2 after CER. By overcoming the limitation of *Cl intermediate coverage on PtN4 SAC, the low&#8208;coordinated Pt SAC displayed superior CER performance to commercial RuO2 and PtN4 benchmarks. This work provides new insights into the rational design of coordination geometry in SACs for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Mn3O4/Pt Oxide&#8208;on&#8208;Metal Inverse Catalyst Facilitates Hydrogen Spillover for CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional Pt/Mn3O4 catalyst suffers from sluggish hydrogen spillover due to strong Pt&#9472;H binding at interfacial Pt&#948;+&#9472;O&#9472;Mn sites. In contrast, the Mn3O4/Pt inverse catalyst enables more efficient hydrogen spillover and enhanced CO2 hydrogenation, owing to weaker H adsorption and a more favorable transition&#8208;state geometry along interfacial Pt&#9472;Mn&#9472;O pathway.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, the migration of metal&#8208;activated hydrogen species across support surfaces, is key for many H&#8208;related reactions. However, questions remain about how the metal/oxide interfaces affect hydrogen spillover and hydrogenation reaction. Here, we construct Mn3O4&#8208;on&#8208;Pt(111) (Mn3O4/Pt(111)) inverse catalyst and Pt clusters&#8208;on&#8208;Mn3O4 (Pt/Mn3O4) catalyst, and image hydrogen spillover behavior using high&#8208;pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the onset H2 partial pressure for hydrogen spillover is two orders of magnitude lower at Mn3O4/Pt(111) than at Pt/Mn3O4. This structural promotion effect was leveraged to synthesize MnOx/Pt/C inverse catalyst by depositing MnOx on Pt nanoparticles, which exhibits a 1.8&#8208;fold higher CO2 conversion compared to conventional Pt/MnOx/C catalyst during CO2 hydrogenation. Theoretical calculations reveal that the inverse catalysts promote hydrogen spillover via weaker H adsorption and a more favorable transition&#8208;state geometry at interfacial Pt sites, particularly along the Pt&#9472;Mn&#9472;O pathway. The Pt/Mn3O4 interfaces feature strong H binding on Pt&#948;&#8314; and high H diffusion barriers, which can be partially mitigated by CO co&#8208;adsorption. These findings demonstrate that inverse structure offers both electronic and geometric advantages at the interfaces, enabling efficient hydrogen spillover for hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Pt Atomic Site&#8208;Engineered Redox Mediator Boosts Electrosynthesis of Formic Acid from Glycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic Pt site&#8208;engineered Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads redox mediator is reported for greatly boosting glycerol conversion, which circumvents the involvement of Ni3+&#8211;O. This regulatory strategy can effectively break the high potential limitation of the dual&#8208;mediator mechanism, thus enabling high&#8208;performance electrosynthesis of formic acid from glycerol at remarkably low potential.








Abstract
Electrophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated non&#8208;electrocatalytic processes on Ni&#8208;based catalysts enable highly selective electrosynthesis of formic acid from glycerol. However, this process, usually mediated by dual mediators of Ni3+&#8211;O and Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads, is significantly plagued by the high potential of Ni3+&#8211;O. Herein, we report a class of Pt atomic site&#8208;engineered Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads redox mediators without Ni3+&#8211;O involvement for breaking the dual&#8208;mediator mechanism limitation, achieving efficient formic acid electrosynthesis from glycerol at remarkably low potential. We demonstrate that Pt atomic sites on Ni aerogels can promote Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads generation, thereby circumventing the Ni3+&#8211;O pathway and favoring initial C&#9472;C bond cleavage and sequential hydrogen atom transfer of C1 intermediates. The resultant Ni93Pt7 exhibits a remarkably low onset potential of only 1.25&#160;V and a high efficiency of 250 C for &#8764;100% glycerol conversion, outperforming Ni aerogels (1.36&#160;V, 300 C) and catalysts reported previously, along with excellent stability over 180&#160;h. We further demonstrate the broad applicability of this atomic site&#8208;promoted redox mediator engineering for low&#8208;potential electrosynthesis of low&#8208;carbon compounds from other vicinal polyols.

&lt;p&gt;Electrophilic oxygen-mediated non-electrocatalytic processes on Ni-based catalysts enable highly selective electrosynthesis of formic acid from glycerol. However, this process, usually mediated by dual mediators of Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;, is significantly plagued by the high potential of Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O. Herein, we report a class of Pt atomic site-engineered Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; redox mediators without Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O involvement for breaking the dual-mediator mechanism limitation, achieving efficient formic acid electrosynthesis from glycerol at remarkably low potential. We demonstrate that Pt atomic sites on Ni aerogels can promote Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; generation, thereby circumventing the Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O pathway and favoring initial C&#9472;C bond cleavage and sequential hydrogen atom transfer of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates. The resultant Ni&lt;sub&gt;93&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a remarkably low onset potential of only 1.25&#160;V and a high efficiency of 250 C for &#8764;100% glycerol conversion, outperforming Ni aerogels (1.36&#160;V, 300 C) and catalysts reported previously, along with excellent stability over 180&#160;h. We further demonstrate the broad applicability of this atomic site-promoted redox mediator engineering for low-potential electrosynthesis of low-carbon compounds from other vicinal polyols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conductive Knitting of Covalent Organic Framework Manipulates Spin Density, Orbital Reorganization, and Charge Mobility for Outstanding Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent integration of polythiophene chains into COFs enables the transformation of 2D structure into a well&#8208;defined, highly conductive 3D framework. This molecular weaving strategy not only significantly enhances electrical conductivity but also induces pronounced HOMO&#8208;LUMO spatial separation, increases active site density, and ultimately leads to superior photocatalytic performance in quinazolinone photosynthesis.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts but are hindered by inherent limitations such as low interlayer charge mobility, restricted active site accessibility, and inefficient charge separation. Herein, we constructed a thiophene&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based COF photocatalytic system, comprising a COF with thiophene&#8208;modified pore walls and a quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COF formed via in situ oxidative polymerization&#8212;generated polythiophene chains covalently linked to the COF skeleton. The knitting of 2D COF layers with conjugated polythiophene units endows the 3D COF with enhanced light absorption capability and improved conductivity by four orders of magnitude. The synergistic structural and functional merits of this 3D COF achieve exceptional performance in quinazolinone photosynthesis (99% conversion, &gt; 96% selectivity), doubling the selectivity of its 2D COF. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that thiophene polymerization induces pronounced HOMO&#8208;LUMO spatial separation and a substantial increase in spin density. These results demonstrate that interlayer covalent linkages of thiophene can manipulate active site density and charge mobility to improve photocatalytic efficiency. The polythiophene chains serve as conjugated bridges, narrowing the bandgap, and creating additional electron transport pathways. This discovery pioneers a paradigm for enhancing photocatalytic activity via interlayer conductive weaving strategy in COF architectures.

         <title>Probing Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution at Individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 Photocatalyst Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;SECM was used to probe the photocurrent and to map H2 and O2 evolution rates during water splitting on individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8722;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles, observing catalytic heterogeneity on the microscale.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;based photocatalysts for overall water splitting convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel without the use of any photovoltaic devices. As such they have the potential to revolutionize renewable energy production on Earth. While proven efficiencies have reached 1.1%, further improvements of photocatalyst technology depend on a better understanding of energy loss mechanisms on the individual particle level. Here, we conduct the first in operando photoelectrochemical measurements on individual micrometer&#8208;sized Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles. We find that the photocatalyst particles behave mainly as water oxidation photoanodes reaching up to 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#160;V versus RHE and a photovoltage of &#8764;1.00 V under 4.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 ultraviolet illumination. This proves that charge separation in the unbiased Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 catalyst is driven by a junction at the n&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;liquid contact. While O2 is detected symmetrically around photocatalyst particles, uneven H2 evolution profiles reflect an irregular Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 cocatalyst distribution. Additionally, the H2 evolution activity varies significantly between different photocatalyst particles. This suggests that performance gains are possible by better controlling catalyst composition on the microscale.

         <title>Regioisomerization&#8208;Directed MR&#8208;TADF Emitters: Enhanced RISC and Suppressed Aggregation Toward High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isomerization&#8208;directed twisted conformation boosts reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), enabling a fast RISC rate of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8309;&#160;s&#8722;1, narrowband blue emission, and strong resistance to aggregation. The resulting devices deliver an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.7% with suppressed roll&#8208;off at high luminance. 








Abstract
The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) performance of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is fundamentally constrained by their slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and pronounced aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). Herein, through regioselective borylation, we design and synthesize a series of blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters. The regioisomerization&#8208;directed twist configuration synergistically enhances RISC while suppressing ACQ, without compromising spectral purity. The emitter with twist configuration exhibits a remarkably fast RISC rate constant (kRISC) of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1, narrowband blue emission with a small full&#8208;width at half maxima (FWHM) of 23&#160;nm, and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94%. The corresponding OLEDs deliver high&#8208;performance narrowband blue emission, with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.4%, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance (EQE1000&#160;=&#160;22.2%). Notably, excellent performance is retained even at elevated doping levels (EQEmax&#160;=&#160;29.4% at 20&#160;wt%). This work provides a design paradigm for advancing blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters toward practical display technologies.

         <title>The Chemistry and Biology of the Tetrodotoxin Natural Product Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrodotoxin is best known as the poison of the pufferfish, which is a delicacy in Japanese cuisine. Its toxicity arises from the selective blockage of NaV channels, which is depicted for the NaV1.7 pore, highlighting the DEKA motif, which permeates sodium ions. Depending on the subtype, inhibiting NaVs can lead to respiratory paralysis (NaV1.4) and heart failure (NaV1.5) or promote the treatment of pain (NaV1.7&#8208;NaV1.9).








Abstract
Tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxic marine alkaloid, first isolated in 1909 from pufferfish and named after the biological order tetraodontiformes. Since its structural elucidation in 1964, it has attracted the interest of synthetic organic chemists due to its exceptional polarity, complex architecture, and important biological activity. This review highlights the diversity of the tetrodotoxin natural product family and discusses the origins of derivatives, biosynthetic hypotheses, and biological activities. Furthermore, potential therapeutic applications and structure&#8211;activity relationship studies are covered, along with the total syntheses of the natural product and selected derivatives that were published to date.

Its toxicity arises from the selective blockage of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels, which is depicted for the Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 pore, highlighting the DEKA motif, which permeates sodium ions. Depending on the subtype, inhibiting Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;s can lead to respiratory paralysis (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4) and heart failure (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5) or promote the treatment of pain (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7-Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxic marine alkaloid, first isolated in 1909 from pufferfish and named after the biological order tetraodontiformes. Since its structural elucidation in 1964, it has attracted the interest of synthetic organic chemists due to its exceptional polarity, complex architecture, and important biological activity. This review highlights the diversity of the tetrodotoxin natural product family and discusses the origins of derivatives, biosynthetic hypotheses, and biological activities. Furthermore, potential therapeutic applications and structure&#8211;activity relationship studies are covered, along with the total syntheses of the natural product and selected derivatives that were published to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of Retro&#8208;Isomeric Peptides for Tuning the Polymer Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers containing hydrophobic amino acids for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Crystals of both the retro&#8208;isomers underwent TAAC polymerization to yield isomeric &#8220;difficult peptide&#8221; polymer mimics with differences in reactivity, regioselectivity, and properties. Our study shows that sequence reversal is a new way to obtain structurally and functionally diverse polymers via topochemical polymerization.








Abstract
Peptidomimetic polymers containing hydrophobic amino acids and nonpeptidic linkages are interesting for various applications, particularly hydrophobic coatings. We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers decorated with azide and alkyne, viz. N3&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M1) and its retro&#8208;isomer N3&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M2), for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. On heating the crystals at 100&#160;&#176;C, both monomers underwent TAAC polymerization, yielding isomeric &#8220;difficult peptide&#8221; polymer mimics. The monomers showed stark differences in reactivity and regiochemistry of the product formed. Monomer M1 yielded polymer P1 having a 1:1 ratio of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linkages, and monomer M2 reacted regiospecifically, giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer P2. We investigated the hydrophobicity of these isomeric polymers by measuring water contact angles (WCA) of surfaces coated with these polymers; P1 and P2 showed WCA of 120&#176; and 132&#176;, respectively. Our study demonstrates that sequence reversal is a novel approach for accessing structurally and functionally different polymers via topochemical polymerization.

         <title>NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Hydroarylation of Unactivated Alkenes Enabled by Outer&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes using diaryliodonium salts has been developed. This strategy enables high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity in both terminal and internal alkenes via a mechanistic shift to dissociative single&#8208;electron transfer. Mechanistic studies highlight migratory insertion as the key selectivity&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Asymmetric hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes provides a direct route to enantiomerically enriched C&#9472;C bonds in aryl&#8208;containing compounds, a key transformation in pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. While recent advances have achieved high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with terminal alkenes, controlled hydroarylation of unactivated internal alkenes remains challenging. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed protocol that overcomes this limitation through a mechanistic paradigm shift. By employing diaryliodonium salts as dual&#8208;function reagents, our method achieves high enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydroarylation of both internal and terminal unactivated alkenes. These salts enable a transition from concerted to stepwise oxidative addition via dissociative single&#8208;electron transfer (DSET), generating a cationic alkyl&#8208;nickel intermediate prone to fragmentation and aryl radical addition. Mechanistic studies, including a key experiment in 1,4&#8208;dioxane yielding an enantiomerically pure solvent&#8208;functionalized product, establish migratory insertion as the enantio&#8208; and regio&#8208;determining step. This approach not only expands the scope of asymmetric hydroarylation but also provides a new mechanistic framework for selective hydrofunctionalization reactions.

         <title>Unveiling the Power of Dark State Photocages: An Efficient Pathway to Triplet State Under Near&#8208;Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a dark state photocage was proposed based on near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated leuco dyes. The dark state enhances triplet&#8208;state formation, enabling the release of dyes and functional molecules under red light irradiation. This platform exhibited excellent &#8220;OFF&#8221;&#8208;to&#8208;&#8220;ON&#8221; tumor imaging contrast and effective tumor inhibition against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and lung metastases.








Abstract
The photocage platform provides a synergistic approach to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Before light activation, both pro&#8208;photosensitizers and pro&#8208;drugs remain inert, ensuring safety. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, they undergo photoactivation and controlled release in deep tissues. However, the low photolysis efficiency of conventional singlet&#8208;state photocages limits their in vivo applications, necessitating an exploration of how excited&#8208;state dynamics influence photolysis. In this study, we introduce the concept of a &#8220;dark state photocage&#8221; and establish a photocage platform responsive to NIR light by incorporating phenoxazine or phenothiazine groups. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the dark state enhances triplet&#8208;state formation and facilitates intersystem crossing, thereby promoting photolysis. These photocages achieve functional molecule release under low&#8208;power NIR light (15 mW&#160;cm&#8315;2), with an efficiency of up to 90%. This advancement enables a sharp transition from an &#8220;OFF&#8221; to an &#8220;ON&#8221; tumor imaging signal and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer under NIR light irradiation, effectively integrating PDT and chemotherapy.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Luminescence Thermometry with Magnetic Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the application potential of magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) techniques is showcased through the first demonstration of MCPL&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry. With the presence of dual&#8208;signaled bands, and the combination of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple linear regression, remarkable sensitivities of up to 30.6%&#160;K&#8722;1 are achieved with the [Dy(acac)3(phen)] complex at 293&#160;K.








Abstract
Lanthanide(III) materials display remarkable optical properties, making them valuable for advancing remote luminescent sensors. The narrow emission bands and energy&#8208;transfer processes can be tailored to respond to external stimuli, such as temperature changes and magnetic fields. The application of magnetic fields lifts the Zeeman degeneracy, creating electronic spin polarization, and giving rise to magneto&#8208;optical phenomena. Magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) is a magneto&#8208;optical technique in which the differential emission of left and right circularly polarized light is induced by a magnetic field oriented parallel or antiparallel to the light propagation axis. In the context of lanthanide(III) materials, this technique has only been explored in a few studies as a characterization tool. In this study, we present MCPL for a Dy(III) complex for the first time, highlighting its significant potential for magneto&#8208;luminescence thermometry. By studying the [Dy(acac)3(phen)] complex (phen: 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline; acac: acetylacetonate) as an example, a maximum relative sensitivity of 19.7%&#160;K&#8722;1 was observed at 293&#160;K, highlighting the tremendous potential that MCPL emitters hold in the field of luminescent thermometers.

         <title>Homologous Ladder Cyclohexasilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the synthesis of a homologous series of ladder cyclohexasilanes containing 1, 2, or 3 fused rings. The tricyclosilanes rank among the most architecturally and stereochemically complex oligosilanes yet synthesized. A combined experimental and theoretical study suggested that the diastereoselectivity in a key annulation is governed by kinetic control. This study also revealed extended &#963;&#8208;conjugation with each additional ring within the all&#8208;trans ladder cyclosilanes series.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of five new examples of ladder cyclohexasilanes, possessing up to three consecutive fused rings and differing in relative ring fusion configuration and side chain structure. By coupling a 1,4&#8208;dipotassiooligosilyl dianion to a cyclohexasilane, we obtained bi&#8208; and tricyclic ladder cyclohexasilanes. Combined experimental and theoretical studies suggested that annulation could favor the cis configuration under kinetic control, while the trans configuration predominates under thermodynamic control. Computational studies show that with each additional ring in the trans&#8208;diastereomeric series, the predicted onset of light absorption shifts to longer wavelengths.

         <title>A &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; Fluorescent Probe for Multi&#8208;ROS Imaging Unveils Ferroptosis&#8208;Driven Liver Fibrosis Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the molecular network linking ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, a novel &#8220;cocktail&#8221; fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, was designed to monitor dynamic changes in three ROS species in activated HSCs and liver fibrosis mouse models. By application of the probe, the NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;HSCs activation signaling pathway and the pro&#8208;fibrotic role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis were successfully elucidated.








Abstract
Liver fibrosis is a pathological repair response to chronic liver injury and may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma if untreated. Currently, no approved therapies specifically target advanced liver fibrosis, thus exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis has become crucial. Previous studies have highlighted significant controversy regarding the role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis. Given that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as key mediators to both processes, ROS may serve as a molecular nexus connecting ferroptosis and liver fibrosis. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular network involving ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, we designed and synthesized the first multi&#8208;functional &#8220;cocktail&#8221; fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, enabling highly sensitive and selective simultaneous imaging of O2&#8226;&#8722;, H2O2, and ONOO&#8722;. FP&#8208;ROS was successfully employed to assess ferroptosis levels in the livers of fibrosis mice following drug intervention. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we elucidated the signaling pathway NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a critical role in HSCs activation and further elucidates the molecular interplay between ROS and ferroptosis in fibrosis progression. These findings provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis.

         <title>Deconstructive Radical&#8211;Radical Coupling for Programmable Remote Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified approach to access a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls through a radical&#8208;promoted deconstructive process utilizing dual photocatalysis/carbene catalysis is reported. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with a broad scope with robust functional group tolerance along with application in the preparation of &#947;&#8208;amino esters, three&#8208;component manifolds, and the first enantioselective deconstructive synthesis of 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls using a chiral NHC catalyst.








Abstract
Dicarbonyl compounds are structural motifs that have been extensively utilized in synthetic chemistry, and their downstream transformations have proven valuable in synthesizing numerous heterocycles. Conventional methods for accessing such compounds include the Stetter reaction, the Michael reaction, and Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation. However, a flexible and enabling platform for obtaining all types of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls remains undeveloped. Reported herein is a unified approach to access a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls through a radical&#8208;promoted deconstructive process utilizing dual photocatalysis/carbene catalysis. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with a broad scope with robust functional group tolerance along with application in the preparation of &#947;&#8208;amino esters, three&#8208;component manifolds, and the first enantioselective deconstructive synthesis of 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls using a chiral NHC catalyst.

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Derived Polyanionic Crosslinked Gel Interfacial Layer with Ion&#8208;Sieving and Ion&#8208;Regulating Capabilities for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered interface layer with ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capacity is constructed to stabilize Zn anodes by simultaneously restricting SO&#8324;2&#8315; diffusion and creating high&#8208;conductivity pathways for Zn2&#8314;, thereby mitigating side reactions. Sodium lignosulfonate forms a molecular adsorbent layer that chelates Zn2&#8314; to regulate uniform deposition, achieving high performance of Zn ion batteries.








Abstract
The severe side reactions and rampant dendrite growth on the zinc (Zn) electrode significantly hinder the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, we fabricate a multifunctional interfacial layer composed of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and polyanionic gel featuring ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capabilities that effectively protects the Zn anode. The abundant &#9472;SO3&#8722; groups in the polyanionic gel optimize the Zn2+ solvent sheath structure while simultaneously providing ion&#8208;sieving function, which significantly facilitates Zn2+ migration. The lignin derivatives are pre&#8208;adsorbed onto the Zn anode surface, directing nucleation along the Zn (002) plane and offering electrostatic shielding effects to facilitate uniform Zn2+ deposition. Additionally, the polyanionic gel inhibits water activity by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water, while the PVDF layer adjacent to Zn electrode significantly reduces water&#8208;induced side reactions. Consequently, the Zn electrodes incorporating this protective layer demonstrated stable and efficient deposition/stripping behaviors across a wide range of current densities. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells demonstrate remarkable cycling stability, maintaining the capacity of 176.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 and 101.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This innovative strategy presents a promising approach to the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. The reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.








Abstract
The distinctive chemical properties of fluorine atoms have enabled fluorine&#8208;containing compounds to make significant strides in the pharmaceutical and materials fields. However, due to the very limited synthetic methods, the enormous potential of N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds has not yet been unlocked. In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. Additionally, the reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.

         <title>Bicyclic Selenenyl Sulfides with Tuned Bioreductive Step Rates Reveal Constraints for Probes Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol reductants activate dichalcogenide probes by a cascade of partly reversible steps. Careful dichalcogenide engineering can tune the rates of these steps separately, to aim at probes that are kinetically selective for specific oxidoreductases in live cells. Here, we deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of bicyclic selenenyl sulfides, giving probes that selectively target the selenoenzyme TrxR1.








Abstract
The reductive activation of dichalcogenide probes by thiol&#8208;type oxidoreductases proceeds through a cascade of consecutive, partly reversible steps. Stereocontrol elements can modulate the reaction rates of these steps to reach substrate&#8208;controlled kinetic selectivity for reductase chemotypes in live cells. We now deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of unprecedented bicyclic selenenyl sulfides (SeSP), arriving at probes that selectively target the mammalian selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase TrxR1. We accessed these densely functionalised cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;thiaselenanes on gram scale over 5 steps by using a regioselective key step that elaborates an unusual, differentially protected 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;aziridine intermediate through sequential one&#8208;pot chalcogen introduction and selenenyl sulfide formation. By profiling a set of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomeric bicycles for their partly or fully reversible reactivity during reductive activation, we show how effects that slow their reduction steps (addition then resolution) can compensate by vastly accelerating subsequent activation (cyclisation) speeds, such that cellular processing is effective and TrxR&#8208;selective. More broadly, this study shows how multistep cascade probes can leverage conformational effects and internal noncovalent interactions to differentiate step kinetics along their on&#8208;target versus off&#8208;target reaction pathways, thus achieving reaction&#8208;based target selectivity in complex biological settings.

         <title>Optimizing Bromine Complexation and Kinetics: a Bisimidazole Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8208;Br Static Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a symmetric bisimidazole&#8208;based complexing agent, [bMImB]Br2, that integrates high N+ atomic charge and low solubility with minimal steric hindrance to enable strong bromine complexation and fast redox kinetics, enabling ZnBr static batteries with high energy density, excellent efficiency, and robust cycling stability.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;bromine (Zn&#8211;Br) static batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage, yet the practical application is hindered by the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off about bromine complexing agents (BCAs) between bromine complexation strength and redox kinetics. Herein, we report a rationally designed bisimidazolium salt, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;1&#8208;yl) butane dibromide ([bMImB]Br&#8322;), which features a symmetric molecular structure that reconciles this contradiction. [bMImB]Br&#8322; demonstrates strong bromine affinity, stemming from its high atomic charge of N+ and low solubility&#8212;properties comparable to those of tetraalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts. Simultaneously, it retains low steric hindrance typical of monoimidazole compounds, thereby enabling fast electrode kinetics. As a result, Zn&#8211;Br batteries incorporating [bMImB]Br&#8322; deliver a high specific energy of 116 Wh&#183;kg&#8315;&#185;, alongside an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.22% and energy efficiency (EE) of 89.35% at 10 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;2 (0.5 C) for over 150 cycles. Furthermore, the flexible pouch cell maintains a discharge capacity of 110 mAh and 99.7% CE over 100 cycles, even under mechanical deformation. This work offers a generalizable molecular design strategy for developing next&#8208;generation BCAs in halogen&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Accompanying ATP Synthesis in Polydopamine Microreactors Covered by Lipid Bilayers with ATPase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of CO2 accompanying ATP synthesis is achieved by a biomimetic assembled microreactor based on formate dehydrogenase (FDH), Calvin cycle, and ATPase. FDH fixes CO2 into formate by sacrificing NADH, and the Calvin cycle helps the regeneration of NADH. The protons generated by the enzyme cascade reaction drive the ATPase on the biomimetic membrane to synthesize ATP. 








Abstract
Global energy and environmental crises have stimulated increased efforts toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals or energy substance. Inspired by natural chloroplasts and mitochondria, we build an innovative polydopamine&#8208;armored multiple enzyme microreactor for co&#8208;immobilizing glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric phosphokinase (PGK), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and ATPase&#8208;incorporating proteoliposome, providing spatially confined microenvironments akin to natural systems. Within this microreactor, GAPDH and PGK catalyze the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate to 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric acid, reducing &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH and generating a proton influx that drives ATP synthesis. The microreactor possesses strong affinity for CO2, combined with FDH, facilitates the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, oxidizing NADH back to NAD+ and enabling the recycling of the NAD+/NADH redox couple. This process further boosts ATP production by contributing additional protons. Such microreactor adeptly orchestrates the chloroplast's enzymes to fix CO2 and the mitochondrion's enzymes to synthesize ATP into a unified artificial biomimetic system, effectively replicating the glycolysis process to simultaneously achieve CO2 fixation, NADH regeneration, and ATP synthesis. This strategy not only holds great potential to inspire significant design innovations for more efficient ATP synthesis from low&#8208;value substances but also greatly expands the application scenarios for biomolecular motors.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sila&#8208;Cycloaddition of Dichlorodisilanes: Selective Si&#9472;Cl Activation for Cyclic Disilanes and Enantioenriched Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes enables efficient access to diverse cyclic disilanes via selective Si&#9472;Cl activation. The method tolerates broad diene scope, offers an enantioselective variant, and reveals a unique Ni&#8304;&#8208;mediated SN2&#8208;type activation pathway.








Abstract
Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila-cycloaddition between dichlorodisilanes and 1,3-dienes enables efficient access to diverse cyclic disilanes via selective Si&#9472;Cl activation. The method tolerates broad diene scope, offers an enantioselective variant, and reveals a unique Ni&#8304;-mediated S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-type activation pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila-cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3-dienes. This transformation proceeds under mild, reductive nickel catalysis via an unusual Si&#9472;Cl bond activation pathway and accommodates a broad range of dienes, including bulk feedstocks, cyclic, multi-substituted, aliphatic, aromatic dienes, and trienes. An asymmetric variant further enables the efficient construction of chiral disilane frameworks with high enantioselectivity. The resulting disilacarbocycle adopts boat-like conformations, as revealed by X-ray analysis, due to the elongated Si&#9472;Si and Si&#9472;C bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that a triplet Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species engages in an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-type oxidative addition to the Si&#9472;Cl bond, favoring this pathway over a concerted Si&#9472;Si activation. The resulting Si&#9472;Ni(I) intermediates are energetically preferred over Si&#9472;Ni(II) analogs in the subsequent diene insertion step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO in 100%: The Synergistic Effect of Nickel and Europium in Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of 3d&#8208;4f nanoclusters with analogous structures were synthesized, and the {Ni24Eu10} cluster demonstrates high stability and exceptional performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, which can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the Ni(II) and Eu(III) metal centers within its [Ni4Eu] assembly units.








Abstract
Heterometallic transition&#8208;rare earth metal (3d&#8208;4f) clusters with synergistic catalytic activity are rarely identified. Herein, two families of closely related 3d&#8208;Eu clusters were designed to analyze the role of Eu(III) ions during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO. The [M24Eu8] family, where M&#160;=&#160;Co or Ni, shows much lower activity (CO production &lt; 2078&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) compared to the [M24Eu10] family (CO production &gt; 5838&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This is due to the two additional Eu(III) ions in the apical position of the latter which are very active for converting CO2 into CO. Moreover, we found the nickel analogues are better than the cobalt ones, especially for [Ni24Eu10] which exhibits 100% CO selectivity and very high efficacy of 6545.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, while the [Co24Eu10] only shows 55% CO selectivity. Therefore, the coexistence of both apical Eu(III) and Ni(II) ions has been experimentally revealed to be critical for this exceptional catalytic performance of the [Ni24Eu10] cluster. As such, this work unambiguously reveals a synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts and may open a new avenue for more sophisticated reaction design by using the heterometallic coordination clusters.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks With Enhanced Chemical and Photochemical Stability for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stable covalent organic framework (TZ&#8208;COF) incorporating fused&#8208;heterocycle linkages has been synthesized, showing exceptional chemical resilience under harsh conditions and superior photostability relative to traditional double&#8208;bond&#8208;linked COFs. The in situ formation of thiazole linkages provides new protonation sites, enhancing the framework's hydrophilicity, expanding its range of light absorption, and reducing exciton binding energy.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest for their potential in photocatalytic solar fuel generation. However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused&#8208;heterocycle thiazole&#8208;linked COFs (TZ&#8208;COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction using chrysene&#8208;6,12&#8208;diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused&#8208;ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12&#160;M HCl), strong base (12&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M MeONa), reducing (1&#160;M NaBH4), and oxidizing (1&#160;M H2O2) agents, along with superior photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazoles introduce new, robust protonation sites compared to commonly used imine linkages, which improve the hydrophilicity, expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework. TZ&#8208;COF&#8208;17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.

         <title>Remote and Spatiotemporal Modulation of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Croconaine Dyes via NIR Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate a light&#8208;mediated strategy for fabricating supramolecular polymers and copolymers. By tuning laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength, supramolecular structures can be precisely controlled. The spatial precision of laser irradiation further enables localized supramolecular polymerization and sol&#8211;gel transitions. These findings establish a dynamic platform for regulating supramolecular nanomaterials with tailored structures and functions.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization holds great promise for the fabrication of well&#8208;defined nanostructures. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control over the dynamic assembly of supramolecular polymers using external stimuli remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation strategy that exploits the intrinsic photothermal properties of croconaine&#8208;based molecular building blocks to modulate the aggregation&#8211;dissociation equilibrium of seeds, thereby enabling the formation of supramolecular polymers and copolymers. Light irradiation provides enhanced tunability through adjustments in laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength. Notably, the spatial precision afforded by laser irradiation allows for localized seed dissociation, offering a new approach for spatially controlled supramolecular polymerization. This method also enables efficient light&#8208;mediated gel formation, spatially selective sol&#8211;gel transitions, and healing in supramolecular organogels. These findings demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive strategy for regulating supramolecular polymerization and open new avenues for constructing nanomaterials with programmable structures and functions.

         <title>Acetone Derivatives for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation, Trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;Methylation of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthetic method enables methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of (hetero)aryl halides using cost&#8208;effective methylation reagent (TDTP, TDTPCD3, and TDTP&#8208;13CH3) derived from acetone and isotopic analogs. This homogeneous catalysis protocol bypasses traditional organometallic reagents, operates via methyl radical generation and cross&#8208;coupling, and tolerates diverse functional groups and complex substrates.








Abstract
The development of low&#8208;cost, readily available, and broadly applicable reagents for the methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of aryl chlorides is crucial. Using acetone and its isotopic derivatives as feedstocks, we have prepared the methylating, trideuteromethylating, and 13C&#8208;methylating agents TDTP (2&#8208;(1,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine), TDTP&#8208;CD3, and TDTP&#8208;&#185;3CH3. Under nickel catalysis and without any additional redox reagent, these reagents efficiently methylate a wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides, chlorine&#8208;containing complex molecules and phenolic derivatives, showing efficient functional&#8208;group tolerance and scalability; they, therefore, hold great promise for drug discovery and complex molecule synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed synthetic method enables methylation, trideuteromethylation, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-methylation of (hetero)aryl halides using cost-effective methylation reagent (TDTP, TDTPCD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and TDTP-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) derived from acetone and isotopic analogs. This homogeneous catalysis protocol bypasses traditional organometallic reagents, operates via methyl radical generation and cross-coupling, and tolerates diverse functional groups and complex substrates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of low-cost, readily available, and broadly applicable reagents for the methylation, trideuteromethylation, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-methylation of aryl chlorides is crucial. Using acetone and its isotopic derivatives as feedstocks, we have prepared the methylating, trideuteromethylating, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-methylating agents TDTP (2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine), TDTP-CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and TDTP-&#185;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Under nickel catalysis and without any additional redox reagent, these reagents efficiently methylate a wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides, chlorine-containing complex molecules and phenolic derivatives, showing efficient functional-group tolerance and scalability; they, therefore, hold great promise for drug discovery and complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Reductive N2 Cleavage and Nitride Insertion Reactivity at Molybdenum Complexes Supported by a Rigid PNP Pincer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive N2 cleavage at an acridane PNP pincer&#8208;supported Mo center leads to the first crystallographically characterized example of an unusual Mo(IV) nitride species featuring a bridging N2 coordination stabilized via Mo&#8208;N2 d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; backbonding interactions. Nitride functionalization with CO leads to Mo(II) isocyanate species.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitride species represent key reactive intermediates in reductive N2 cleavage and functionalization. Toward a better understanding of nitride transfer reactivity, we present a series of Mo&#8208;nitride complexes supported by a rigid diphosphino&#8208;acridane pincer ligand. Notably, the stepwise reduction of a MoIVCl3 complex under N2 allows the isolation of a bridging diazenido intermediate as well as a dinuclear Mo&#8208;nitride species (4) accommodating a bridging N2 moiety. This is the first example of a Mo(IV) nitride&#8208;N2 species, and extensive 15N&#8208;labeling studies were performed to characterize the bridging dinitrogen, diazenido, and nitride moieties. The structure of 4 adopts two orthogonal &#960;&#8208;backbonding interactions between N2 and two structurally rigidified MoIV(N) fragments featuring a filled d&#960; orbital. Effective &#960;&#8208;backbonding from such a MoIV(N) fragment leads to the isolation of PMe3, CO, and CNtBu substituted analogues. Further, reactivity of the Mo&#8208;nitride species with &#960;&#8208;acidic CO and isocyanide leads to the formation of MoII&#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;carbodiimide species, respectively. Computational studies suggest that nitride carbonylation proceeds via an associative nitride insertion pathway, encouraging further studies in direct N2 fixation to value&#8208;added products via nitride functionalization.

         <title>Tuning Eley&#8211;Rideal Mechanism in Electrochemical Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ER mechanism plays a vital role in electrocatalytic hydrogenation, yet its rate&#8208;limiting factors remain poorly understood. Using acetylene hydrogenation as a model, we uncover atomic activation and spatial hindrance as key ER bottlenecks. Cu3Au, with balanced adsorption strength, exemplifies how introducing weak&#8208;binding atoms into moderate&#8208;binding hosts can optimize ER activity.








Abstract
The Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER) mechanism is pivotal in heterogeneous catalysis processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, which rely heavily on the interaction between solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;phase species. In this study, we examine the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene to explore the factors influencing the ER mechanism. We employed the density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the hydrogenation of acetylene on face&#8208;centered cubic metals and copper&#8208;based alloys. Microkinetic modeling identifies changes in the rate&#8208;determining steps of different alloys as electronegativity decreases. We then constructed the volcano plot for the adsorption energy toward C2H2 and the reaction rate, which predicted that Cu3Au is the best candidate alloy for the C2H2 semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Both extensive prior research and our experimental findings validated our volcano plot. Notably, our work points out the two key determinants of the ER mechanism: atomic activation and steric hindrance. For metals with weaker adsorption, steric hindrance primarily obstructs the ER mechanism, while for metals with stronger adsorption, the ER mechanism is hindered due to the challenge of atomic activation. Therefore, introducing weak adsorption sites into moderately adsorptive metals can improve the overall efficiency of the ER reaction by balancing these two factors.

         <title>Merging Photocatalysis with Chiral Lewis Acid Catalysis for Enantioselective Hydrosilylation/Hydrogermylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrosilylation and hydrogermylation reactions of &#593;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides under synergistic catalysis are reported. Various chiral organosilicon and organogermanium compounds were prepared by a radical process with good results, which could be transferred to drug intermediates. A series of experiments and DFT calculations revealed the reaction mechanism.








Abstract
Organosilicon compounds demonstrate widespread applications in many fields. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation represents one of the most common and effective methods to synthesize chiral organosilicon compounds, but it largely relies on electron&#8208;rich alkenes and structurally specific hydrosilanes. Visible light photocatalysis has emerged as a promising new platform for hydrosilylation. However, the enantiocontrol of photoinduced asymmetric hydrosilylation concerning highly reactive radical species is a great challenge. Herein, we report a synergistic catalytic strategy for enantioselective hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes by merging anthraquinone as a dual&#8208;tasked photocatalyst with a chiral Lewis acid catalyst. This protocol shows broad hydrosilane scope with efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, delivering diverse enantioenriched organosilicon compounds, which could be readily converted into a series of medicine molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between the photocatalyst and the alkene is crucial for enantiocontrol. Additionally, enantioselective radical hydrogermylation was also achieved under the visible light photoinduced synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Precision Photochemistry: Every Photon Counts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every photon used in a photochemical reaction has the power to dictate the outcome of the reaction. We present a framework whereby understanding the role that each photon has in a reaction can enablechemists to realise the true power of photochemistry and dramatically improve reaction outcomes.We coin this field Precision Photochemistry.








Abstract
Photochemistry is undergoing a precision transformation. Through technological advancements, such as the advent of light emitting diodes and monochromatic lasers, chemists are now able to use photons not only as an energy source but also as a tool for directing photochemical processes with both wavelength and spatiotemporal precision. Enabled by these technologies, the discovery that photochemical action often does not align with molar extinction has catalysed the growth of the research field that we coin Precision Photochemistry. We explain how precision photochemistry stands on four fundamental pillars: molar extinction, wavelength&#8208;dependent quantum yield, concentration of the chromophores, and the length of the irradiation. Each of these four pillars are intrinsically linked and dictate the experimental conditions that should be used (e.g., wavelength, light intensity, and solvent system), as we demonstrate through simulations of a photochemical uncaging system. Building on these pillars, we propose a concrete definition for Precision Photochemistry and highlight important fields within chemistry that will benefit from careful consideration of them. Finally, we address key experimental considerations that must be taken into account when conducting precision photochemistry including the light source, the reaction setup, and the method for determining (wavelength&#8208;dependent) quantum yields. These factors are critical in furthering the development of the field of Precision Photochemistry.

We explain how precision photochemistry stands on four fundamental pillars: molar extinction, wavelength-dependent quantum yield, concentration of the chromophores, and the length of the irradiation. Each of these four pillars are intrinsically linked and dictate the experimental conditions that should be used (e.g., wavelength, light intensity, and solvent system), as we demonstrate through simulations of a photochemical uncaging system. Building on these pillars, we propose a concrete definition for &lt;i&gt;Precision Photochemistry&lt;/i&gt; and highlight important fields within chemistry that will benefit from careful consideration of them. Finally, we address key experimental considerations that must be taken into account when conducting precision photochemistry including the light source, the reaction setup, and the method for determining (wavelength-dependent) quantum yields. These factors are critical in furthering the development of the field of &lt;i&gt;Precision Photochemistry&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In their Research Article (e202511266), Jiansheng Li and co&#8208;workers synthesized asymmetric CoN1O2 single atoms (SAs) sites and Co nanoclusters (NCs) confined within highly graphitized carbon layers on holey MXene nanosheets via a dual&#8208;coordination strategy. The Co NCs optimized the electronic structure of Co sites, synergistically enhancing peroxymonosulfate adsorption and activation. This catalyst achieved ultrafast pollutant removal through an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven polymerization pathway.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Thermodynamics of Water Displacement from Binding Sites and its Contributions to Supramolecular and Biomolecular Affinity (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 35/2025)</title>

         <dc:description>
The binding of a hard non&#8208;interacting sphere to a macrocyclic cavity has been investigated to expose the importance of cavity water as determinant of supramolecular and biomolecular binding affinity in aqueous solution. The results demonstrate that the thermochemical properties of water molecules present inside different macrocyclic receptors can largely increase or decrease their binding affinities, for example, for the popular host cucurbit[8]uril, as reported by Jeffry Setiadi, Frank Biedermann, Werner M. Nau, and Michael K. Gilson in their Research Article (e202505713).

A photoswitchable helicate acts like a molecular claw machine: under 405 nm light, it functions as a molecular ratchet that greatly speeds up regioselective ZnII&#8594;FeII exchange, converting a homometallic ZnII helicate into a heterometallic one. Consequently, FeII cations are captured with precise spatial and temporal control, similar to arcade claw machines. Moreover, this ratchet operates autonomously under white light, creating an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium structure, as reported by Larissa von Krbek et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202508952).

Anthraquinone enables silanes/germanes to &#8220;climb&#8221; these barriers under light, forming radicals that enter the &#8220;reaction sea.&#8221; As substrates, catalysts and products interact, their dynamic exchange creates rippling waves. A chemist (boatman) continuously casts reactants into the reaction sea. Upon completion, the products are harvested.

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined nanospaces are key to the design of porous materials like COFs, MOFs, and molecular cages for applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, and energy storage. This Minireview explores the rising role of porous organic cages (POCs) as versatile synthons, highlighting their integration into Cage&#8208;COFs, Cage&#8208;MOFs, and Cage&#8208;POPs. These hybrid materials offer tunable porosity, structural precision, and exciting potential for future applications. 








Abstract
Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, cage&#8208;containing polymers and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks: Design Strategy, Structure Feature, and Applications in Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the synthesis strategies, structural characteristics, and structural regulation strategies of metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), as well as their electrochemical energy storage performance in various energy storage devices (LIBs, LMBs, ZABs, Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, LSBs, ZIBs, and SCs).








Abstract
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which can integrate the properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), exhibit high stability, adjustable pore structures, and catalytic activity of metal sites owing to the synergistic interaction between metal sites and covalent backbones. In this regard, MCOFs have gained significant attention as promising electrode materials, where metal ions (Mn+) function as molecular structure switches, providing MCOFs with diverse active sites and modifying their charge density by incorporating different Mn+, thereby imparting unique energy&#8208;storage properties to MCOFs. Furthermore, by optimizing the synthesis strategies of MCOFs, their topological and dimensional structures can be regulated to ensure the stability of the MCOFs. In the challenging landscape of energy storage, MCOFs have surpassed the performance limitations of traditional COFs. Through precise atomic&#8208;level control of metal sites and innovative design of dynamic covalent chemistry, they can significantly enhance the performance of batteries, achieving remarkable performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, and other applications. This review systematically summarizes the research advancements of MCOFs in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices, including lithium&#8208;ion, Li&#8211;CO2, and Zn&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, it examines the synthesis strategies, structural regulation, and structural characteristics of MCOFs to address the challenges encountered in various energy storage devices.

         <title>Superprotonic Conduction Over Wide Humidity Range Driven by Enhanced Proton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although numerous studies on covalent organic framework &#8208;based proton&#8208;conducting membranes have been documented, the majority concentrate on synthesis, with mechanistic investigations remaining relatively sparse. In addition, the mechanistic studies can be categorized into two primary areas. The first area is dedicated to the study of proton diffusion, including the analysis of hydrogen bonding patterns and the mobility of guest molecules. The second area delves into strategies to enhance the proton&#8208;dissociation capability of acidic groups, such as discussing the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups or zwitterionic species. In this work, we meticulously study the role of proton intermediates in proton conduction and have successfully achieved superprotonic conductivity by reducing the proton dissociation energy of these intermediates.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;conducting materials play a key role in various fields, and their proton conduction is profoundly restricted by the proton dissociation process. This process has two components: dissociation from acidic groups (e.g., &#8722;SO3H) and dissociation from intermediate species (e.g., H3O+, C&#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H+). Extensive research has concentrated on the former, utilizing acidic groups with minimal proton dissociation energy or low pKa values, while the latter's substantial effects have been largely overlooked. In reality, proton&#8208;accepting atoms within intermediates, such as oxygen and nitrogen, typically produce a higher electron cloud density compared to those in acidic groups. This results in a pronounced electrostatic binding effect on mobile protons, as well as high dissociation energies. Thus, diminishing the dissociation energy associated with intermediates is paramount in the development of high&#8208;performance proton conductors. Herein, we construct one covalent organic framework&#8208;based proton conductor, achieving superprotonic conduction over a wide humidity range by decreasing the dissociation energy of protons from intermediates. The success of this approach can be attributed to two key factors: the crowded guest molecules within the framework that mitigate proton hydration, and the concurrent establishment of C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H+ interactions. These combined effects significantly reduce the electrostatic attraction exerted on mobile protons, thereby enhancing proton conduction.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Cyanogen Vacancies in Prussian Blue for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an anionic complexation strategy to construct cyanide vacancy&#8208;architected Prussian blue frameworks. Through controlled ligand&#8208;field perturbation, the engineered vacancies activate reversible Fe low&#8208;spin &#8596; high&#8208;spin transitions during cycling, creating adaptive structural accommodation that stabilizes Fe redox centers. This vacancy&#8208;mediated spin&#8208;state engineering establishes a new design paradigm for manipulating electron configuration through defect&#8208;property coupling in coordination materials.








Abstract
Prussian blue (PB), recognized as a promising cathode material, has gained significant attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the influence of anion vacancies on the stability of the PB framework remains controversial, impeding a comprehensive grasp of their precise role in electrochemical performance and the controlled synthesis of PB with smaller anionic vacancies remains challenging due to the limitations inherent in current synthesis strategies. Herein, we present an anion complexation method to synthesize PB materials with tunable cyanide vacancy concentrations. Furthermore, we propose a vacancy&#8208;driven mechanism that promotes spin transitions coupled with lattice bending, which are more reversible at low&#8208;spin Fe sites, leading to excellent low&#8208;spin stability and the design of materials with outstanding electrochemical performance. This anion complexation method not only provides a novel synthetic pathway for PB materials but also advances the understanding of the composition&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships between cyanide vacancy configurations and spin transition mechanism, highlighting its potential for future energy storage applications.

         <title>Exploring Excited State Proton Transfer in Thin Films Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the effect of vibrational strong coupling of the &#9472;OH stretching mode on the excited state proton transfer process. The results reveal that the quantum yield of RO&#8722;emission and the ESPT rate constant enhance by a factor of two under VSC, compared to the noncavity, half&#8208;cavity, and off&#8208;resonance films. These findings highlight the potential of VSC in controlling various types of chemical reactions that involve proton transfer processes.








Abstract
Molecular structure, solvent/matrix, the surrounding environment, and molecular vibrations can influence the excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Theoretical studies predict that light&#8208;matter strong coupling can modify the energy barrier for proton transfer reactions. Here, we experimentally explore the role of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on the ESPT using the weak photoacid, 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthalenesulfonate (N8S) as the probe. The ESPT in N8S can occur through a solvent/matrix bridge connecting the proton&#8208;donating and accepting units. To check the role of VSC, we embedded N8S in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix and strongly coupled the &#9472;OH stretching vibrational modes of PVA. The steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission analysis reveal that the quantum yield of RO&#8722; emission and the ESPT rate constant enhance by a factor of two under VSC, compared to the noncavity, half&#8208;cavity, and off&#8208;resonance films. Our findings indicate that VSC can be a tool to control the proton transfer processes, opening avenues for developing physically tunable photoacid&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Bulk&#8208; and Surface&#8208;Engineered Carbon Nitride with Promoted Electron Transfer for NADH Regeneration and Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a rhodium complex&#8208;immobilized porous carbon nitride (Rh*&#8208;PCN) through a bulk&#8208; and surface&#8208;engineering strategy. The optimized Rh*&#8208;PCN showed a maximum initial reaction rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1 for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. By integrating Rh*&#8208;PCN with glutamate dehydrogenase, we established an enzyme&#8208;photo&#8208;coupled catalytic system capable of driving artificial photosynthesis for L&#8208;glutamate production.








Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN), a well&#8208;known photocatalyst, has been extensively utilized in light&#8208;driven redox reactions, including NADH regeneration. However, its catalytic efficiency is hindered by rapid charge recombination due to obstructed electron transfer. Herein, we developed a highly porous CN coated with a thin layer of rhodium complex (Rh*&#8208;PCN) through a combination of bulk and surface engineering for enhanced NADH regeneration. The bulk&#8208;engineered porous network of PCN facilitates oriented electron transfer in Rh*&#8208;PCN, while the surface&#8208;engineered Rh layer minimizes the electron transfer distance between PCN and the rhodium complex. Rh*&#8208;PCN achieves an initial NADH regeneration rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185;. Moreover, Rh*&#8208;PCN suppresses enzyme deactivation by compartmentalizing the enzyme from the photogenerated holes on PCN and the rhodium complex. When integrated with glutamate dehydrogenase, the Rh*&#8208;PCN/enzyme coupled system produces L&#8208;glutamic acid.

         <title>Microscale Tattooing of Hydrogels and Cells: Benzoxaborole&#8208;Driven Microcontact Printing (&#181;CP) on Glycosylated Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a polymer brush&#8208;assisted microcontact printing (&#181;CP) to pattern glycosylated surfaces. We used a benzoboraxole derivative as an ink for surface patterning. With this novel method, we could functionalize wafer surfaces possessing glycopolymer films, surface&#8208;glycosylated polymer microparticles as well as cellular interfaces.








Abstract
Microcontact printing (&#181;CP) is a widely used technique for microscale surface patterning. In this study, we present a polymer&#8208;supported &#181;CP method for the patterning of (bioactive) glycosylated surfaces under hydrated conditions. Patterning is achieved by direct contact with a grooved polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp, whose surface was grafted with a dopamine&#8208;containing polymer. The polymer brushes offer an anchor for the boronic acid derivative 6&#8208;aminobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ol (ABOB), used as an ink for surface functionalization, to introduce patterns to three different surfaces as substrates: (1) monosaccharide&#8208;modified hydrogel surfaces possessing aldose (glucose, fucose, galactose) or ketose (fructose, sorbose) functions; (2) glycosylated surfaces of polymeric microspheres; and (3) the membranes of mammalian cells, such as human primary gastric cells and others. During &#181;CP, ABOB patterns transferred to the target surface through the formation of carbohydrate&#8208;ABOB complexes at fully hydrated, neutral pH conditions. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the successful transfer of ABOB patterns to glycosylated surfaces, with clear &#8220;tattoo&#8208;like&#8221; signatures observed on hydrogels, glycosylated particle surfaces and cellular interfaces.

         <title>Efficient Red Light&#8211;Driven Singlet Oxygen Photocatalysis with an Osmium&#8208;Based Coulombic Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red light&#8208;absorbing bichromophores with straightforward preparation and superior photocatalytic activity were developed. Spectroscopic studies provided deep insights into the intra&#8208;ion&#8208;pair energy transfer key step and the novel approach.








Abstract
Photoactive osmium complexes are widely used sensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen because they can be excited directly into their triplet states with low&#8208;energy red light. However, their short&#8208;lived excited states reduce quenching efficiencies and reaction quantum yields significantly. To elongate the excited state lifetime, osmium complexes have been linked to organic chromophores to form molecular dyads. This approach, although effective, is time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming, hampering larger&#8208;scale applications.

&lt;p&gt;Red light-absorbing bichromophores with straightforward preparation and superior photocatalytic activity were developed. Spectroscopic studies provided deep insights into the intra-ion-pair energy transfer key step and the novel approach.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoactive osmium complexes are widely used sensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen because they can be excited directly into their triplet states with low-energy red light. However, their short-lived excited states reduce quenching efficiencies and reaction quantum yields significantly. To elongate the excited state lifetime, osmium complexes have been linked to organic chromophores to form molecular dyads. This approach, although effective, is time- and resource-consuming, hampering larger-scale applications. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward approach by directly mixing a readily available cationic osmium complex and an anionic perylene derivative in solution. Strong Coulombic interactions facilitate rapid energy transfer (&#8764;100&#160;ps) from the excited osmium complex to the perylene derivative, mimicking a dyad-like system. Detailed spectroscopic investigations revealed an increased singlet oxygen formation rate by over one order of magnitude at sub-millimolar perylene concentrations, attributed to i) the three orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the perylene triplet state produced via intra-ion-pair energy transfer and ii) an inherently high singlet oxygen quantum yield of that key species. The novel catalyst system enables highly productive photooxygenations in water and in a MeOH/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 10:1 mixture, highlighting the broad applicability and versatility of the Coulombic dyad approach for photocatalytic synthesis and wastewater treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photosensitizer Repositioning Affords an Enantiocomplementary Enzyme for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we capitalize on the versatility offered by genetic code expansion to develop a proficient photoenzyme for [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions that is enantiocomplementary to our recently developed photoenzyme EnT1.3. By repositioning the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer and subsequent directed evolution, we have developed an efficient, highly selective and oxygen tolerant enzyme for a range of [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions.








Abstract
The combination of genetic code expansion and directed evolution has recently given rise to enantioselective photoenzymes for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of quinolone and indole derivatives. However, the enzymes reported to date only allow access to one enantiomeric series of the strained cyclobutane products. Here, guided by a crystal structure of our previously engineered enzyme EnT1.3, we show how judicious repositioning of the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer affords an enantiocomplementary [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cyclase, CEnT1.0. Following directed evolution, a proficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzyme (CEnT1.4) emerged that promotes [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of a quinolone derivative with exquisite enantiocontrol (99% e.e.) and substantially enhanced regioselectivity compared with EnT1.3 (r.r. 62:1&#160;vs. 9:1). Structural analysis of CEnT1.4, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveals a well&#8208;sculpted active site pocket that pre&#8208;organises the substrate for regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalysis. This study highlights the versatility offered by genetically programmed (photo)catalytic elements when developing enzymes for altered stereochemical outcomes.

         <title>A Phenomenological Symmetry Rule for Chemical Reactivity Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general symmetry rule emerges from the study of charge transfer complexes in cavities that points to an underlying framework to the predict the outcome of chemical reactivity under vibrational strong coupling.








Abstract
Symmetry is known to strongly influence the course of a chemical reaction. It has also been found to play a key role in vibrational strong coupling (VSC), where it can influence the outcome of chemical reactions or alter chemical equilibria. However, the precise nature of this effect and its extent remains elusive. To further explore the role of vibrational symmetry, we have investigated the equilibrium constants of different charge transfer complexes, in particular of isomers of trimethyl benzene belonging to different point groups from which a general symmetry rule emerges. We describe the strongly coupled system by a direct product of irreducible representations associated with the complexes and the cavity. As a consequence, the coupled vibration is associated with a new irreducible representation that projects differently on the reaction coordinate of the charge transfer complexation, reflecting the changes in the equilibrium constants. This phenomenological symmetry rule points to a general underlying framework for predicting the outcome of chemical reactivity under VSC.

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored in Metal Borides Enable Hydrogen Spillover for Superior Electrochemical Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides are developed as high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalysts utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. This strategy facilitates dissociation of water into *H and promotes the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface, thereby synergistically reducing the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. 








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate represents a promising and sustainable route for valuable ammonia generation. However, a vital challenge in the nitrate reduction reaction is an insufficient supply of active hydrogen (*H) and slow kinetics at a low working potential, which result in low production efficiency and high energy consumption. Here, we report the single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides as a high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalyst utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. Notably, the RuSA/np&#8208;Ni3B exhibits a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.2%, an NH3 yield of 30.4&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1, and an energy efficiency of 39.1% at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;atom Ru anchored in nanoporous Ni3B not only can efficiently dissociate water into *H and simultaneously promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface but also can optimize surface states of Ni3B active centers, which synergistically reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer integrating nitrate reduction reaction with furfuryl alcohol oxidation reaction achieves current density of 1&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.72&#160;V with 100&#160;h stability, improving the energy efficiency and economy of the system.

         <title>Glycosylation&#8208;Dependent Stability of Human Pentraxin&#8208;2 Revealed by Surface&#8208;Induced Dissociation and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate glycosylation pattern of human Pentraxin&#8208;2 (PTX&#8208;2) poses a challenge in studying the structural impact of individual glycans. By combining surface&#8208;induced dissociation (SID) or unfolding (SIU) with ion mobility mass spectrometry, we successfully differentiated the stability of glycoengineered PTX&#8208;2 variants. Our approach specifically revealed how terminal sialylation influences both complex and subunit stability.








Abstract
Pentraxin&#8208;2 (PTX&#8208;2), also known as Serum Amyloid P component, functions as an immunoregulatory glycoprotein and plays a crucial role in fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Desialylation of PTX&#8208;2 has recently been associated with reduced bioactivity and diminished inhibition of fibrocyte differentiation in IPF patients. Each monomer in the naturally assembled pentameric complex is N&#8208;glycosylated, predominantly featuring terminal sialic acids on biantennary glycans. However, the influence of these glycoforms on PTX&#8208;2&#8242;s mechanism of action (MoA) and conformational properties has not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we demonstrate the combined application of surface&#8208;induced dissociation (SID) and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) to assess the impact of specific glyco&#8208;engineered PTX&#8208;2 variants on the stability of its pentameric and decameric complexes. We further explore the effect of individual monomer glycosylation on complex stability. Our results reveal that high levels of terminal sialylation significantly enhance complex stability, whereas desialylation and mannosylation reduce the stability of both pentameric and decameric PTX&#8208;2 forms. Regarding the stability of single PTX&#8208;2 monomers ejected from the pentamer, in contrast, we found that desialylated and highly mannosylated glycans contribute to the individual monomer stability.

         <title>Selective Nanopore Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A and B in a Single Sample</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a nanopore&#8208;based sensing strategy for ultrasensitive and selective detection of MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B. Utilizing enzyme&#8208;specific peptide transformations and &#945;&#8208;hemolysin nanopores with cucurbit[7]uril, our method achieves picomolar detection, real&#8208;time analysis, and high specificity in cellular and tissue samples, offering a powerful tool for neurological research, diagnostics, and drug screening.








Abstract
Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B) are key enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and are critical biomarkers for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Here, we present a highly sensitive nanopore&#8208;based method for the selective detection and quantification of MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B using specifically designed peptide probes. These probes undergo enzyme&#8208;specific oxidation, generating distinct nanopore translocation signatures that enable precise identification. Our method achieves picomolar&#8208;level detection, outperforming conventional assays such as ELISA. Importantly, we demonstrate its applicability in complex biological samples, including cell lysates (SH&#8208;SY5Y and HepG2) and mouse brain and liver tissues, with results strongly correlating with ELISA. The ability to selectively detect both enzymes within a single sample highlights its advantage in studying enzyme interplay in biological systems. This label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time approach offers a powerful tool for biomedical research, disease diagnostics, and drug screening, with potential for expanding to other clinically relevant enzymes.

         <title>PyBOX&#8208;Integrated Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino acid chiral pool synthesis strategy has been developed for the construction of 1D chiral covalent organic frameworks incorporating a PyBOX skeleton. Subsequent metalation with an ice crystal&#8208;templated freeze&#8208;drying process led to sustainable heterogeneous catalysts for scalable asymmetric acetalization and A3&#8208;coupling reactions.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) are the new sensation in asymmetric catalysis. The pyridine&#8208;bis(oxazoline) (PyBOX), on the other hand, is a well&#8208;known class of privileged chiral ligands that can be incorporated with various metal ions for diversified homogeneous asymmetric organic transformations. The integration of the PyBOX into the COF platform will undoubtedly lead to a new breed of heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts. Herein, we report the first example of PyBOX&#8208;based CCOF via chiral pool synthesis for scale&#8208;up catalytic asymmetric acetalization and A3&#8208;coupling reaction. This research provides a novel type of sustainable COF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalyst with gratifying functionalities.

         <title>Thermodynamics of Water Displacement from Binding Sites and its Contributions to Supramolecular and Biomolecular Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The affinity between a guest and a macrocyclic host depends strongly on the water encapsulated inside the host cavity, with free&#8208;energy variations on the order of 20&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 being possible even in the absence of direct host&#8208;guest interactions. This conclusion&#8211;which contrasts alternative views&#8211;can be drawn from molecular dynamics simulations for the binding of a guest with pseudo&#8208;hard&#8208;sphere potential and cucurbit[8]uril host models with varying polarity and polarizability.








Abstract
The role of water displacement in noncovalent binding has been debated in the fields of supramolecular chemistry and drug design. We use molecular dynamics simulations of idealized host&#8208;guest systems to address the long&#8208;standing controversy of whether water is merely a bystander or an actual driver of noncovalent binding in aqueous solution. To isolate hydration effects, we consider a pseudo&#8208;hard&#8208;sphere guest binding to a series of cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based macrocyclic host models whose energetic interactions with water vary widely. The computed free energy cost of displacing water from binding sites ranges from 0 to +37&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, strongly influencing binding affinities. However, neither water density nor excess chemical potential reliably indicates the thermodynamic favorability of cavity water. These results support the concept that &#8220;unfavorable&#8221; binding site water contributes to high&#8208;affinity binding and resolve the paradox of stable but thermodynamically unfavorable cavity water. This work provides insights into the nature of the hydrophobic effect in molecular recognition and offers a framework for understanding the role of water in binding across various host&#8208;guest and protein&#8208;ligand systems.

         <title>Multipoint Coordinative Capture of Olefinic Substrates Utilizing Metal&#8208;Carbon Bonds by Macrocyclic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a macrocyclic tetranuclear palladium complex, which has four coordination sites within its inner cavity as a host molecule. The complex captured squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with six C&#9552;C double bonds, through multipoint palladium&#8208;carbon bonds, and formed a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. The host also selectively captured methyl &#945;&#8208;linolenate over methyl oleate and methyl linoleate.








Abstract
Terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids containing C&#9552;C double bonds are biologically and synthetically important compounds. The transformation of these substrates catalyzed by proteins relies on precise molecular capture. However, achieving precise molecular recognition of C&#9552;C double bonds using synthetically designed hosts remains a significant challenge. We now report a macrocyclic palladium tetranuclear complex that functions as a synthetic receptor featuring coordination sites within its inner cavity. This receptor selectively binds specific double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates. Squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with chemically similar six isoprenoid units, was captured by the macrocyclic complex through the coordination of four out of the six C&#9552;C double bonds, leading to a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. Furthermore, the macrocyclic complex exhibited stronger binding affinity for methyl linolenate compared to methyl oleate or methyl linoleate through multipoint coordinative capture. This unprecedented approach to multipoint coordination of specific unsaturated bonds contrasts sharply with biological and traditional artificial receptors, which typically rely on intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic effects. By achieving precise capture and folding of flexible olefinic substrates, this study establishes a new paradigm for the design of artificial host molecules and a novel platform for enzyme&#8208;like reaction vessels.

         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Direct Levulinate Hydrodeoxygenation to Pentanoic Biofuels over La&#8208;Modulated Ru&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the vital roles of La modification in metal&#8208;zeolite bifunctional catalysts for breaking the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the direct hydrodeoxygenation of biomass&#8208;derived ethyl levulinate into pentanoate biofuels. Optimal La modulation can maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites for enhancing the activity, and attenuate the acid strength for efficiently suppressing the secondary reactions.








Abstract
Disentangling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates has been a great challenge in biomass valorization and related tandem catalysis, by virtue of involving a series of reactions in parallel and in cascade.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents the vital roles of La modification in metal-zeolite bifunctional catalysts for breaking the activity-selectivity trade-off in the direct hydrodeoxygenation of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate into pentanoate biofuels. Optimal La modulation can maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites for enhancing the activity, and attenuate the acid strength for efficiently suppressing the secondary reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disentangling the activity-selectivity trade-off in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass-derived oxygenates has been a great challenge in biomass valorization and related tandem catalysis, by virtue of involving a series of reactions in parallel and in cascade. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of La modulation for Ru-zeolite combinations in the case of direct HDO of neat ethyl levulinate (EL) into ethyl pentanoate (EP). An unprecedented EP yield of 80% and an EP turnover rate (TOR) of 224 mol&lt;sub&gt;EP&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;mol&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, together with excellent stability, were obtained for the optimal Ru/2.8La-Y catalyst for the first time, compared to the current reported &#8220;performance ceiling&#8221; of EP yields of &amp;lt;40% and EP TORs of &amp;lt;120 mol&lt;sub&gt;EP&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;mol&lt;sub&gt;metal&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under similar conditions. Optimal La modulation could maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites and efficiently attenuate the acid strength, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity in the direct HDO of EL into EP while suppressing the further hydrolysis reactions that consume EP. This study provides an effective approach to regulate the acid properties of metal-zeolite bifunctional catalysts, in particular in mediation of compromise in acid density and acid strength factors, for breaking the activity-selectivity trade-off in biomass valorization and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>EDTA&#8208;Mg Nano&#8208;Chelators Amplify Ferroptosis by Artificially Simulating the Epithelial&#8208;Mesenchymal Transition Process and Endogenous Iron Deprivation</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on metal chelation therapy, we utilize the chelation performance of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for different divalent metal ions to achieve the precise regulation of the epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in tumors and simultaneously synergize ferroptosis and immunotherapy to effectively inhibit the growth and metastasis of tumors.








Abstract
Epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in initiating tumor metastasis. Commonly, researchers focus on inhibiting EMT to prevent tumor metastasis. However, they ignore that tumor cells undergoing EMT are more vulnerable to disturbance from the external environment. Tumor cells in this period are a potential therapeutic target, yet precisely regulating the EMT of tumor cells remains a challenging problem to be solved. Here, based on metal chelation therapy, we propose a strategy of artificially mimicking EMT, integrating ferroptosis and immunotherapy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. The prepared ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid&#8208;magnesium (EDTA&#8208;Mg), on the one hand, chelates Ca2+ on the surface of tumor cells to form EDTA&#8208;Ca, causing the dissociation of tumor cells. Meanwhile, E&#8208;cadherin is downregulated, while Vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP&#8208;2) are upregulated, indicating the occurrence of EMT. On the other hand, after EDTA&#8208;Ca is endocytosed by tumor cells, it deprives Fe in the lysosomes to form EDTA&#8208;Fe, which induces ferroptosis through a Fenton reaction. Ferroptosis, combined with the initially released Mg2+, synergistically amplifies the immune response, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, such a strategy of artificially simulating EMT for tumor treatment has hitherto not been reported.

         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective hydrosilylation reaction of acyclic alkyl gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes was developed, giving various chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl silanes with vicinal carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers. A diverse array of stereospecific transformations were performed using these enriched silanes. Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, support Ni(I)&#8211;H mechanism. 








Abstract
The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Access to (3,11)&#8208;Cyclotaxanes&#8212;Synthesis of 1&#8208;Hydroxytaxuspine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Belonging to the family of complex taxanes, 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C is a densely functionalized natural product. The synthesis was realized via a semisynthetic approach, starting from commercially available 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III. A late&#8208;stage photocyclization was utilized to install the characteristic transannular bond of complex taxanes, transforming the classical framework into the intricate cyclotaxane skeleton on gram&#8208;scale.








Abstract
Herein, we present the semisynthesis of complex taxane diterpenoid 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C. Starting from cheap and abundant 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III, a scalable and robust route was developed, enabling an unprecedented gram&#8208;scale access to the intricate (3,11)&#8208;cyclotaxane scaffold. In addition, this represents the first synthetic access to C1&#8208;hydroxylated cyclotaxanes. The natural product is synthesized in 17 steps, with the reactions being performed on decagram&#8208;scale up to an advanced intermediate, establishing the scalability of this approach.

         <dc:description>
Malabaricane triterpenoid sodagnitin E is a chromogen found in various toadstools. This work represents the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;sodagnitin E as well as the first total synthesis of any malabaricane natural product. A Mukaiyama aldol reaction was utilized to perform a convergent synthesis from two enantioselectively synthesized fragments. Additionally, a structural revision of the relative configuration of sodagnitin E is proposed.








Abstract
We report the total synthesis of malabaricane triterpene sodagnitin E, marking the first synthesis of any malabaricane natural product to date. The enantioselective synthesis of two key fragments, followed by their coupling via a Mukaiyama aldol reaction delivered the triterpene framework in a convergent synthesis. A thorough analysis of the synthetic material led to the elucidation of a previously unassigned stereocenter (C17) as well as the reassignment of the configuration at C27. This enabled the structural revision of the relative configuration at the central lactol moiety.

High&#8208;pressure chemical reaction between Bi and various hydrogen&#8208;free C&#9472;N precursors induced by the infrared laser heating in a diamond anvil cell leads to the formation of a compound Bi7C10N18(N3(1&#8208;x)O3x), featuring double layers of poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine [C4N6x&#8208;]n and non&#8208;polymerized guanidinate anions CN35&#8208;. The unprecedented 2D&#8208;polymerized anionic C&#9472;N network represents the intermediate between highly charged CN35&#8208; guanidinate anions and fully condensed graphitic carbon nitride networks.








Abstract
Application of high&#8208;pressure conditions in chemical synthesis has proven to access a wide range of novel nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds and to overcome the stability of the dinitrogen molecule. In the present work, we report the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature (HPHT) synthesis of Bi7C10N18(N3(1&#8208;x)O3x), which features double&#8208;layers of poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine [C4N6x&#8208;]n and non&#8208;polymerized guanidinate anions CN35&#8208;. The structure model was determined by means of synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and is fully corroborated by theoretical calculations. The poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine illustrates an example of a 2D polymerized anionic C&#9472;N network and represents the first intermediate between highly charged CN35&#8722; anions and fully condensed graphitic carbon nitride networks achieved by HPHT conditions. This opens a pathway to a widely varied family of hydrogen&#8208;free nitridocarbonates, which has the potential to develop into an alternative synthesis route to classical polycondensation reactions.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enabled Stable Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes via &#960;&#8208;Type Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial Li/Ni disordered via hydrothermal treatment is achieved in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials to trigger a robust &#960;&#8208;type interaction between metal and ligand. The reductive coupling (charge transfer from O 2p to Ni t2g) and induced symmetry breaking of NiO6 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, which avoids excessive irreversible oxygen release from non&#8208;bonding O 2p state.








Abstract
Effectively stabilizing oxygen redox is the most challenging task for the practical applications of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. However, how to accurately tune the oxygen energy level to achieve reversible redox remains puzzling so far. In this work, we achieve stable oxygen redox in layered Li&#8208;rich materials over the whole voltage range without irreversible O2 release by adjusting the interlayer metal cation environment adjacent to the ligand. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis of metal&#8208;ligand orbital combinations, we confirm the obvious charge transfer from O to Ni due to the &#960;&#8208;type interaction between Ni 3d spin&#8208;down t2g orbitals and O 2p orbitals. Furthermore, Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Ni coordination environment after Li extraction under the &#960;&#8208;type interaction, which enhances the intrinsic competition between anion and cation oxidation, keeping &#960;* state (from O 2p splitting) below the metal band to avoid over&#8208;oxidation. As a result, the modified material shows improved electrochemical performance and stable structural/interface evolution. This work provides new insights into the relationship between the adjacent metal environment and the ligand O redox reactions.

Two types of Ru configurations of single atoms anchored on graphene&#8208;like framework supporting WC1&#8208;x substrates with was constructed by simple Joule heating rapid carbonization for high&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The spatial distance between Ru&#8208;anchored active sites governed by Ru content plays a crucial role in modulating the electronic structure at the reactive center. This tailored electronic feature reduces the reaction energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determine step, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of HER.









Abstract
The correlation between metal loading and overall catalytic performance remains elusive for single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SACs), which hinders the oriented optimization of active site densities and scalable synthesis of them. To effectively address this issue, Ru single atoms with different loading are anchored on the graphene&#8208;like framework and tungsten carbide substrate (WC1&#8208;x) to investigate the synergistic effect among different local configurations. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the loading of Ru atoms critically governs the interatomic distance between adjacent metal active sites at second shell coordination. In situ Raman spectroscopy shows that WC1&#8208;x nanoparticles can break the hydrogen bond network by reorienting H2O molecule adsorption and promoting the availability of active H2O among electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the moderate distance between active sites could further lower the reaction barrier and enhance the catalytic activity. Consequently, the optimal sample Ru&#8208;WC1&#8208;x with 0.76&#160;wt% Ru loading exhibits a low overpotential of 7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer to stably operate for 100&#160;h at 1&#160;A&#8901;cm&#8722;2. Such correlation of spatial effects between different active sites were universally demonstrated in similar systems anchored with either Pt, Ir, or Co elements.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acid&#8208;Mediated DNAzyme Chaperoning for Sensitive Trace Metal Ion Mapping on Live Neuronal Cell Membranes</title>

Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes significantly improves sensitivity and stability, facilitating precise and quantitative mapping of local trace metal ion concentrations on live neuronal cell membranes. This adaptable approach sets a foundation for developing sensitive nanodevices based on DNAzymes.








Abstract
The transient release of metal ions at neuronal cell membranes holds significant implications in neurophysiology and pathology. Consequently, there is a pressing need for sensitive methodologies capable of quantitatively mapping local metal ion concentrations in live cells, aiming to unravel potential mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. DNAzymes have emerged as versatile tools for metal ion detection in live cells, owing to their specificity and other inherent advantages. Efforts to broaden their utility have focused on enhancing the stability and sensitivity of DNAzymes. Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes, aiming at enhancing the stability and activity of DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes is shown to significantly enhance metal ion detection performance, resulting in elevated stability and a two&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity, attributed to alterations in the local net charge induced by TDF. In vitro investigations demonstrate that the nanodevice developed here faithfully maps Cu2+ concentrations within a range of 0&#8211;10&#160;&#181;M on the membrane of neuronal cells, meeting the requirements for Cu2+ sensing under both physiological and pathological conditions. This work presents an easily adaptable approach to enhance the performance of DNAzymes and lays the foundations for the development of other DNAzyme&#8208;based sensitive detection nanodevices.

In vitro investigations demonstrate that the nanodevice developed here faithfully maps Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations within a range of 0&#8211;10&#160;&#181;M on the membrane of neuronal cells, meeting the requirements for Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensing under both physiological and pathological conditions. This work presents an easily adaptable approach to enhance the performance of DNAzymes and lays the foundations for the development of other DNAzyme-based sensitive detection nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Fluorine&#8208;Free Weakly Coordinating Electrolyte Solvents with Enhanced Oxidative Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of silicon is systematically explored as a sustainable strategy to design weakly solvating electrolytes for lithium&#8208;based batteries. After identifying a promising molecular structure via computational screening, coordination spheres and their correlation with electrochemical key performance indicators are compared between electrolyte formulations, revealing that negative hyperconjugation enhances their oxidative stability.








Abstract
High concentrations of conducting salt in electrolyte formulations enhance the agglomeration of ionic species, which has been demonstrated to yield anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases and improved reversibility in several battery configurations. However, industrial application of these electrolytes may be limited due to high costs of electrolyte conducting salts. Here, weakly solvating electrolyte solvents with tailored coordination strength have been established as an approach to achieve ionic agglomeration at moderate conducting salt concentrations and without per&#8208;fluorinated diluents. However, the inevitable presence of uncoordinated solvent molecules in this electrolyte concept renders them susceptible to oxidative decomposition. Although previous efforts demonstrated fluorination as an effective design strategy to tailor the oxidative stability of weakly solvating electrolytes, the per&#8208;fluorinated solvents are toxic and harmful to the environment. Herein, the incorporation of silicon is evaluated as an eco&#8208;friendly approach to dispel electron density of the oxygen lone pair. Though steric demand of substituents is already sufficient to tailor the coordination strength, negative hyperconjugation effectively expands the oxidative stability limit of weakly solvating electrolytes. Combining ion agglomeration and intrinsic oxidative stability, the herein introduced weakly solvating electrolyte enables a notable improvement of reversibility under eco&#8208;friendly conditions, presenting a valid alternative to fluorinated electrolyte solvents.

         <title>Developing HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;Tag Chemical Inducers of Dimerization to Probe Receptor Oligomerization and Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling protein interactions is key to studying signaling. Antibody methods have limits, but chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) using HaloTags and SNAP&#8208;Tags offer precise control. We present CIDs to covalently link heteromers with varied linkers and a FRET&#8208;based sensor. Applied to different tagged cell surface receptors, this allows study of proximity&#8208;induced, ligand&#8208;independent&#160;signaling, including an inherent optical readout.








Abstract
Controlling protein&#8211;protein interactions is critical for dissecting signaling pathways, especially those initiated by ligand&#8208;receptor interactions, which alter receptor oligomerization and drive downstream signaling cascades. Traditional methods for driving protein&#8211;protein complexes use antibodies that face limitations in terms of stoichiometry, geometric rigidity, and antibody specificity. Chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) for fusion proteins such as HaloTag (Halo) and SNAP&#8208;Tags (SNAP) offer precise and covalent control of protein proximities, overcoming limitations of antibody&#8208;dependent methods. In this study, we expand the toolkit of Halo and SNAP CIDs with (1) benzylguanine (BG) and HaloTag ligand (HTL) crosslinkers featuring varying polyethylene glycol linker lengths and update this kit with (2) a FRET&#8208;based dimerizing sensor to induce and verify protein proximity. Here we establish our CIDs on extracellularly Halo&#8208; and SNAP&#8208;tagged TGF&#946;, BMP, neurotrophic factor, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby elucidating the signaling potential of ligand&#8208;independent dimerization in a heteromeric fashion.

         <title>Selective and Energy Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion through Anion Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed blended OH&#8722; and Cl&#8722; electrolyte to alter the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction microenvironment, achieving ethanol faradaic efficiency of 50% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The blended anions cooperatively promoted ethanol production by increasing *CO coverage and modulating the reactivity of key branching intermediate *CHCOH.








Abstract
Ethanol, with its high market value and stable global demand, stands out as an attractive product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, achieving high ethanol selectivity and energy efficiency at industrial current densities remains challenging. In this study, we employed a blended anion modulation strategy to enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion. The Cu2(OH)3F pre&#8208;catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiencies of 50% and 93% for ethanol and C2+, respectively, at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a blended electrolyte consisting of 2&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M KCl. Comprehensive electrochemical tests, combined with in situ characterizations and theoretical analysis, revealed that chloride and hydroxide increased *CO coverage for efficient C&#9472;C coupling. Moreover, hydroxide stabilizes the *CHCOH intermediate through hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed hydroxide on the catalyst surface, while Cl synergistically enhances its reactivity by promoting water dissociation toward the ethanol pathway.

         <title>Orbital Coupling&#8208;Engineered Coordination&#8208;Unsaturated CuAg Nanochains Drives Spontaneous Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation and Zn&#8208;C2H2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs) is synthesized for ethylene electrocatalytic production, achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. The orbital coupling between the Cu0.5Ag CNCs catalyst and the C2H2 molecules is enhanced and forms a high *H demand surface, where the acetylene hydrogenation process occurs spontaneously without energy barrier. It provides a new way to realize the orbital coupling engineering of coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalysts.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) offers a mild and sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet it faces critical challenges including competitive C&#9472;C coupling for 1,3&#8208;butadiene due to insufficient proton supply and hydrogen evolution under high current densities. To address these limitations, we design a coordination&#8208;unsaturated CuAg bimetallic catalyst with cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs), which synergistically regulates proton dynamics, maintaining high activity from 0.1 to 0.6 A cm&#8722;2 and achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the introduction of Cu makes the d&#8208;band center in Cu0.5Ag CNCs upshift toward the Fermi level, strengthening orbital coupling with C2H2 and creating a high *H demand surface. In situ spectroscopic and density functional theory analyses demonstrate that coordination&#8208;unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag interfacial sites promote spontaneous C2H2 hydrogenation, especially bypassing formation barriers of *C2H2 and *C2H3. This thermodynamic superiority originates from sufficient proton supply and exothermic *H consumption for C2H2 hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst enables a Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery with a power density of 2.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, showcasing dual functionality in electrosynthesis and energy storage. Our work establishes a paradigm for coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalyst design through orbital coupling engineering, providing atomic&#8208;level insights into proton&#8208;mediated reaction control for sustainable chemical manufacturing.

Side&#8208;on coordinated alkaline earth metal hypofluorites F&#8242;M(&#951;2&#8208;OF) (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with OF2 in argon matrices.

Abstract
Side&#8208;on coordinated molecular hypofluorites FM(&#951;2&#8208;OF) (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated alkaline earth metal atoms with diluted OF2 in cryogenic matrices. The structures parallel the non&#8208;VESPR structures of alkaline earth metal difluorides and dihydrides, such that FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar, FCa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar but with a shallow bending&#8208;potential curve, while FSr(&#951;2&#8208;OF) and FBa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) are non&#8208;planar. Bonding analyses show that the interactions between the metal center M2+ and the negatively charged ligands F&#8722; and OF&#8722; are mainly electrostatic. Moreover, for FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF), donation of electron density from OF&#8722; to empty s and p orbitals of magnesium is involved. However, for the heavier alkaline earth metal compounds, the donation to empty d orbitals of the metal center becomes dominant in orbital interactions, which contributes to their non&#8208;planar structures.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Assisted Assembly of Stable High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I)&#8208;Alkyne Nanoclusters for X&#8208;Ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted assembly strategy has been developed for the construction of high&#8208;nuclearity copper nanoclusters. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray scintillation properties of the high&#8208;nuclearity nanocluster are investigated for the first time, demonstrating their potential for advanced radiation detection applications.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;nuclearity, atomically precise copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters remains a formidable challenge due to their high reactivity and&#160;strong aggregation tendency. Here, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted assembly strategy that enables the ambient&#8208;condition synthesis of two robust copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the different core structures including [(C2)8@Cu50] (Cu50) and [(C2)10@Cu56] (Cu56). Both clusters feature distinctive metal shells stabilized by synergistic Cu&#9472;C/O coordination interactions and an extensive outer&#8208;layer hydrogen&#8208;bonding network between the hydroxyl groups of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol &#160;and CF3COO&#8722; ligands,&#160;enhancing molecular rigidity and inoxidizability. Notably, Cu50 displays strong yellow phosphorescence and prominent X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence (XEL). More significantly, it represents the first high&#8208;nuclearity copper nanocluster to be processed into a scintillator film, which exhibits promising X&#8208;ray imaging performance. The present work not only establishes a generalizable hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted assembly strategy for constructing stable, high&#8208;nuclearity copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters, but also demonstrates their practical applicability in X&#8208;ray scintillation, providing new insights into the synthetic design and functional diversification of nanocluster&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Induced Atomic Diffusion in a Molecular Metal Cluster Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the formation and dynamic behavior of atomic vacancy in an organometallic palladium cluster complex. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis and theoretical calculations of the Pd12 cluster [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]2 suggest that an atomic vacancy migrates rapidly at the surface of the metal cluster on the NMR timescale, leading to the vacancy&#8208;induced atomic diffusion in a molecule.








Abstract
The presence of atomic vacancies in a close&#8208;packed material is believed to allow the migration of atoms adjacent to the vacancies, which induces dynamics of atoms. However, it is not known whether atoms in discrete molecules can undergo vacancy&#8208;induced dynamics. We describe herein the generation of a close&#8208;packed Pd12 cluster complex [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]n (n&#160;=&#160;2, 3) with a Pd&#8208;atom vacancy, and the observation of the diffusion of Pd atoms. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis, X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretical calculations indicate that an atomic vacancy is located at the surface sites of the Pd12 core, and that it migrates rapidly on the NMR timescale. This means that all 11 palladium atoms at the surface undergo self&#8208;diffusion with a low energy barrier. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that atomic diffusion occurs within a molecule through the vacancy mechanism.

         <title>Unlocking Dual Recycling in Photo&#8208;Curable Polycyanurate Thermosets Derived from Bio&#8208;Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway recycling strategy for polycyanurate thermosets is presented. The thermosets are prepared by curing a bio&#8208;derived eugenol&#8208;based triazine monomer with various dithiols via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization. Recyclability is enabled through two distinct SNAr&#8208;based depolymerization approaches: selective monomer recovery and closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. The recycled materials retain their original performance.








Abstract
Polycyanurate thermosets are extensively utilized in high&#8208;performance applications due to their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, their inherently crosslinked nature has traditionally rendered them nonrecyclable, limiting their sustainability. Recent studies have demonstrated that these networks can undergo dynamic rearrangement under specific conditions, enabling reversibility. In this study, a bio&#8208;derived cyanurate monomer from eugenol was synthesized and polymerized via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization, yielding recyclable polycyanurate thermosets with robust material properties. The dynamic character of these networks was leveraged through nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) chemistry, unlocking two distinct recycling pathways: i) selective monomer recovery and ii) closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. Depolymerization in the presence of eugenol enabled the selective recovery of well&#8208;defined monomeric components, while phenol&#8208;mediated cleavage facilitated polymer breakdown into chemically recyclable intermediates, which were directly reassembled into reformed thermosets. Both recycling pathways resulted in regenerated polymers that retained their original thermal, mechanical, and thermomechanical properties, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of this approach. By establishing a controlled depolymerization and reassembly framework, this study introduces a sustainable design strategy for achieving closed&#8208;loop recycling in high&#8208;performance thermosets, providing a scalable pathway toward circular polymer materials.

         <title>Accelerating Responsive RNA Release Through Structural Optimization of Disulfide&#8208;Containing Acyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a redox&#8208;responsive strategy for precise RNA control via postsynthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation. These introduced disulfide&#8208;containing acyl groups can be selectively cleaved upon exposure to both exogenous and endogenous glutathione (GSH), enabling traceless RNA release and functional recovery. This approach offers a versatile tool for modifying and manipulating RNAs of diverse lengths or origins.








Abstract
Chemical methods for modifying and manipulating RNA are crucial for advancing its biological studies and applications. While postsynthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation has enabled on&#8208;demand RNA activation, its application to larger, biologically relevant RNAs remains challenging. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;responsive RNA modification via postsynthetic acylation to functionalize RNAs. Three strategies were developed to introduce multiple disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH positions, temporarily blocking RNA function. Exposure to glutathione (GSH) can trigger the traceless release of RNA and restore its biological function. We demonstrate the versatility of this redox&#8208;responsive strategy with RNA constructs of varying lengths, including short synthetic RNA, single guide RNA (sgRNA) as well as longer messenger RNA (mRNA). Furthermore, these disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts respond to endogenous GSH, restoring mRNA translation without the need for cytotoxic exogenous stimuli. Taken together, these results offer a simple and generalizable method for modifying and modulating RNAs regardless of length or origin through structural optimization of acyl groups for facilitating RNA release, setting the stage for broad applicability.

         <title>From Corrosion to Creation: Interfacial De&#8208;Electronation Drives Hydrogenation&#8208;Energy Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative approach is proposed to redefine corrosion engineering, enabling sustainable energy production and the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals and metal&#8211;organic frameworks, while simultaneously addressing critical limitations such as slow reaction kinetics, energy loss, and challenges in hydrogen storage. 








Abstract
Metal corrosion, conventionally perceived as a destructive phenomenon driven by de&#8208;electronation, imposes significant economic burdens and safety hazards. To repurpose corrosion into a valuable resource, we demonstrate a macroscopic corrosion battery concept that harnesses galvanic corrosion to drive the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), high&#8208;value chemicals, and energy generation, challenging conventional corrosion mitigation paradigms. By spatially segregating the corrosion process, the system couples anodic metal de&#8208;electronation with MOF deposition while integrating diverse cathodic reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction, electrocatalytic hydrogenation, and hydrogen peroxide reduction with remarkable accelerated kinetics, thereby achieving universal MOFs and chemical synthesis with high electron and atom utilization efficiencies. The prototype system demonstrates concurrent production of p&#8208;aminophenol (14.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and zinc oxalate (86.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) while generating 34.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 of electrical power. Techno&#8208;economic analysis establishes the inaugural empirical validation of economic feasibility for corrosion&#8208;driven energy&#8208;matter symbiosis, highlighting its high gross profit. Transcending conventional corrosion engineering boundaries for inorganic synthesis, this methodology mechanistically deciphers MOF growth kinetics and advanced system design. By broadening the scope of corrosion utilization, this work enables a paradigm shift from damage mitigation to value creation, providing a blueprint for sustainable chemical&#8208;energy ecosystems.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Based on a Covalent Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A calix[4]resorcinarene&#8208;based molecular cage featuring a large [6&#160;+&#160;12] octahedral structure has been employed as a single&#8208;molecule junction. The connection between sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups and the gold electrodes and leads to a stable junction with a conductance of 10&#8722;3.5 G0.








Abstract
As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single&#8208;molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage&#8208;electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single&#8208;molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single&#8208;molecule conductance was found at 10&#8722;3.5 G&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation, combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well&#8208;defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.

         <title>Low Molecular Weight Multistate Photoswitches Based on Simple Norbornadiene&#8208;Triazine Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>
Our new polyswitchable norbornadiene&#8208;triazine hybrids are promising candidates for molecular based data storage. These small, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecules can be both symmetric or contain different NBD chromophors and exhibit an unprecedently high variety of distinct switching states. By incorporating acid/base&#8208;responsive moieties, the number of achievable states can be doubled.








Abstract
We have synthesized and characterized a series of simple norbornadiene(NBD)&#8208;triazine architectures, including multistate photoswitches with unprecedentedly high information storage densities. The simple mono&#8208;NBDs served as suitable model systems to investigate the underlying absorption and switching characteristics. To increase the complexity stepwise, a bis&#8208;NBD derivative with a symmetric substitution pattern was investigated next. By combining different NBD substituents with varying electron demands, two asymmetric compounds, one bis&#8208;NBD and one tris&#8208;NBD, were prepared and investigated. In the case of the tris&#8208;NBD, the selective switching of the individual NBD chromophores is hampered by the too closely related optical properties of all three NBD units. On the other hand, the asymmetric photoswitch system containing two NBD&#8208;substituents fulfilled the requirements of a selectively addressable multistate system with an extremely high information storage density. Nearly all possible NBD/quadricyclane (QC) combinations could be realized here, including their reversible interconversion and the respective protonated forms. Quantum chemical calculations corroborated our experimental findings.

         <title>Dual Cofactor Co&#8208;Decorated Covalent Organic Framework as an Electron Transfer Regulator for Biomimetic Dioxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel dual cofactor construction strategy of COFs by simultaneously interfacing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) active site and heme as building blocks to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of multiple active sites of the cytochrome P450 for selective O2 activation. This is the first case of introducing dual cofactor into COFs to echo the cytochrome P450 possessing outstanding biomimetic catalytic function.








Abstract
Mimicking the synergy of multiple active sites of oxygenase to achieve selective O2 activation for various oxidations is a very challenging but meaningful task. By introducing the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) active site dihydropyridine amido (DHPA) moiety and heme, a dual cofactor co&#8208;decorated covalent organic framework (COF) was obtained to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of the cytochrome P450 for biomimetic O2 activation. Covalent co&#8208;decoration of dual cofactors in COFs ensures the rapid photogenerated electron transfer from DHPA to heme FeIII to generate FeII, selectively activating O2 to form FeIII&#8722;O2&#8226;&#8722; resembling the cytochrome P450 for improving the performance of alcohol oxidation, avoiding conventionally complex multistep cofactor shuttling and regeneration.

&lt;p&gt;We report a novel dual cofactor construction strategy of COFs by simultaneously interfacing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) active site and heme as building blocks to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of multiple active sites of the cytochrome P450 for selective O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. This is the first case of introducing dual cofactor into COFs to echo the cytochrome P450 possessing outstanding biomimetic catalytic function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimicking the synergy of multiple active sites of oxygenase to achieve selective O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation for various oxidations is a very challenging but meaningful task. By introducing the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) active site dihydropyridine amido (DHPA) moiety and heme, a dual cofactor co-decorated covalent organic framework (COF) was obtained to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of the cytochrome P450 for biomimetic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Covalent co-decoration of dual cofactors in COFs ensures the rapid photogenerated electron transfer from DHPA to heme Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; to generate Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, selectively activating O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; resembling the cytochrome P450 for improving the performance of alcohol oxidation, avoiding conventionally complex multistep cofactor shuttling and regeneration. Control experiments of a COF analogue containing heme but not DHPA suggested that this dual cofactor construction strategy renders COFs excellent activity and selectivity for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. As far as we know, this represents the first case of introducing dual cofactor into COFs to echo the cytochrome P450. The well-defined structural characters and the finely modified bioactive properties open a new avenue to develop novel COFs, which not only augment the diversity of the COF family but also broaden the application of COFs in the field of biomimetic catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterointerfacial Charge Modulation of p&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Frameworks on Graphene Achieving High&#8208;Performance Cl&#8722; Ion Storage with Ultralong Cycling Life</title>

A high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF/graphene hybrid electrode (TAPArGO) with strong interfacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; coupling and dual conductivity engineering is developed for efficient Cl&#8315; ion storage. The electrode exhibits outstanding energy output and ultralong cycling stability, offering new opportunities for next&#8208;generation energy storage and desalination technologies.








Abstract
The charge and ion transport dynamics, storage capacity, and cycling performance of Faradaic Cl&#8722; ion storage electrodes have recently constrained advancements in supercapacitor (SC) and capacitive deionization (CDI). Herein, a high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF (TAPA&#8208;COF)&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion storage material (TAPArGO) with exceptional cycling stability was synthesized via an in situ condensation reaction utilizing graphene as a conductive substrate. The interfacial coupling involving graphene and TAPA&#8208;COF increases the interfacial electron density, boosting local charge accumulation and Cl&#8722; ion storage capacity. Additionally, the dual conductive strategy of incorporating graphene and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization of TAPA&#8208;COF enhances the redox kinetics, while the triphenylamine N redox centers and flexible graphene network improve cycling stability. Consequently, the Cl&#8722; ion asymmetric SC employing the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode achieves a specific energy output of 52.4 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 950 W kg&#8722;1, with exciting cycling durability retaining 96.8% of the initial capacity after 100&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid CDI system based on the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode demonstrates a specific adsorption capacity of 55.0 mg g&#8722;1, along with remarkable cycling desalination/regeneration ability (99.8% after 200 desalination/regeneration cycles). This study expands the application potential of COF&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;performance Cl&#8722; ion storage.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Plasmonic Hot Spot Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is used to investigate in situ turnover frequency of photon emission on a series of shell&#8208;isolated plasmonic nanoamplifier (AuNR@mSiO2). Turnover frequency heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images present the distinct distribution of plasmonic hot spots along a single nanoamplifier. This platform provides an intuitive insight and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects, offering a sight to construct efficient nanoarchitectures of plasmonic electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), an important optical property of noble metal nanomaterials, is extensively applied in electrochemistry. However, the specific LSPR effects on metallic nanoparticles are difficult to unravel and evaluate, owing to simultaneous factors like intrinsic electroactivity and surface interactions. Herein, we designed a series of shell&#8208;isolated nanostructures, with mesoporous silica shells and plasmonic Au Nanorod cores (AuNR@mSiO2), for precisely investigating both LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging was employed to monitor the in situ turnover frequency (TOF) of photon emissions on individual plasmonic nanoamplifiers to determine the dominant factors influencing LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. TOF heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images unveiled distinct hot spot distributions along the plasmonic nanostructures. Our approach provides insight into and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects during electrochemical reactions, thereby facilitating precise electrocatalyst design based on the physiochemical properties of LSPR.

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Confinement Enables Robust Deuterium Bonds for Highly Reversible Aluminum Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum confinement by leveraging D as a quantum bridge is engineered to tailor stronger intra&#8208; and intermolecular D&#8208;bonds, effectively suppressing water reactivity and achieving exceptional HER inhibition. The induced Al3+ solvation structures further inhibit the decomposition of water at the interface and improve Al redox reversibility.








Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) fundamentally limits aluminum electroreduction in aqueous electrolytes by dominating interfacial charge transfer. Here, we suppress HER by engineering deuterium bonds (D&#8208;bonds) through nuclear quantum effects, confining D between D&#8322;O and DMF molecules. This quantum confinement weakens hydrogen delocalization and restructures the Al3+ solvation sheath, reducing water activity kinetically and thermodynamically. The regulated electrolyte enables uniform aluminum nucleation and dense plating layers, achieving 569&#160;h (0.05&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and 379&#160;h (0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) cycling stability in the 2D2O/1DMF electrolyte, which outperforms traditional sulfate electrolytes by 3.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. Our work uniquely leverages nuclear quantum confinement to engineer robust D&#8208;bonds, simultaneously suppressing HER and enabling atomic&#8208;level control over aluminum ion solvation structures for unprecedented Al redox reversibility in sulfate electrolytes. This exemplification pushes the electrolyte engineering from extensive component adjustment to quantum precision engineering, which provides an innovative solution for the high&#8208;activity water&#8208;based battery system

         <title>Boosting Performance of Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc Ion Batteries via Zincophilic Solubilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a zincophilic solubilization strategy was proposed to break the concentration limit in Zn(Ac)2 hydrogel electrolytes. Based on the salting&#8208;out effect, this provides high mechanical durability for AZIBs, enabling in situ polyurea&#8208;based solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The assembled batteries have high platting/stripping reversibility and high capacity.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in tackling severe issues facing aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, to satisfy the quest of flexible and eco&#8208;friendly batteries, developing low&#8208;cost and high mechanical durability hydrogel electrolyte remains a challenge. Here, employing the zincophilic solubilizer urea, we break the classical concentration limits of the low&#8208;cost Zn(Ac)2 salt and introduce it into the hydrogel skeleton. The &#8220;salting out&#8221; effect give the polymer chain sediments a tighter bundle and twist effect. The as&#8208;formed hydrogel electrolyte can endure 557% high elongation and 3.7&#160;MPa compressive strength to resist repeated zinc plating/striping process and external physical stimuli. The in situ polyurea solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer leads to thermodynamically stable anode/electrolyte interface. Utilizing the hydrogel electrolyte, the zinc anode shows high reversibility, leading to an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.93% for 150 cycles on the Zn//Cu battery. When assembled with NH4V4O10 cathode (NVO), the full battery delivers a high capacity of 253.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 beyond 1000 cycles longevity at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1. The pouch battery also shows a high capacity of 280.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and operate steadily for 90.13% retention after 200 cycles, and maintained a stable voltage even experienced bending and folding.

The as-formed hydrogel electrolyte can endure 557% high elongation and 3.7&#160;MPa compressive strength to resist repeated zinc plating/striping process and external physical stimuli. The in situ polyurea solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer leads to thermodynamically stable anode/electrolyte interface. Utilizing the hydrogel electrolyte, the zinc anode shows high reversibility, leading to an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.93% for 150 cycles on the Zn//Cu battery. When assembled with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (NVO), the full battery delivers a high capacity of 253.8&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; beyond 1000 cycles longevity at 1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The pouch battery also shows a high capacity of 280.7&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 500&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and operate steadily for 90.13% retention after 200 cycles, and maintained a stable voltage even experienced bending and folding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NonCovalent Aggregation&#8208;Driven D&#8208;Band Engineering in Nickel Cocatalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent interactions in Ni(bpy)3Br2 aggregates induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, elevating the Ni d&#8208;band center. This electronic modulation lowers the energy barriers for CO2 activation and *COOH formation, significantly enhancing CO2 photoreduction kinetics with high CO selectivity. 








Abstract
Efficient CO2 activation remains a pivotal challenge in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, necessitating precise electronic modulation of catalytic centers to overcome kinetic limitations. In this work, we engineer Ni(bpy)3Br2 cocatalyst aggregates via noncovalent self&#8208;assembly and systematically unravel the role of aggregation in governing photocatalytic performance. A synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrates that symmetry disruption within the aggregates induces localized charge redistribution. Such a charge redistribution triggers a 0.6&#160;eV upshift in the Ni d&#8208;band center, which delivers lower Gibbs free energies for the formation of *CO2 and *COOH. The optimized aggregates achieve a record&#8208;high quantum yield of 26.84% at 450&#160;nm with 99.3% CO selectivity, representing the highest performance reported to date for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion systems. Importantly, the d&#8208;band center of the Ni sites can be precisely modulated by varying the aggregation degree of Ni(bpy)3Br2. This work not only advances a novel d&#8208;band center modulation strategy for electronic configuration engineering but also provides in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level insights into the aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;regulated d&#8208;band center.

         <title>Tuning Encodable Tetrazine Chemistry for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Bioorthogonal Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We expand the bioorthogonal chemistry toolkit by synthesizing and characterizing 29 tetrazine ncAAs and evaluating their genetic encoding into proteins. Site&#8208;specific incorporation was achieved, and tools to assess efficiency, fidelity, stability, and reactivity were applied. This roadmap enabled the design of tunable tetrazines and the fastest quantitative labeling at 10&#8310;&#160;M&#8315;&#185;s&#8315;&#185; without compromising stability.








Abstract
Using genetic code expansion (GCE) to encode bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a promising method for protein labeling, both in vitro and within cells. Here, we demonstrate that tetrazine (Tet) amino acids incorporated into proteins are highly tunable and have extraordinary potential for fast and quantitative bioorthogonal ligations. We describe the synthesis and characterization of reaction rates for 29 Tet amino acids (20 of which are new) and compare their encoding ability into proteins using evolved tRNA/RS pairs. For these systems, we characterized on&#8208;protein Tet stability, reaction rates, and ligation extents as the utility of a bioorthogonal labeling group depends on its stability and reactivity when encoded into proteins. By integrating data on encoding efficiency, selectivity, on&#8208;protein stability, and in&#8208;cell labeling for Tet tRNA/RS pairs, we developed the smallest, fastest, and most stable Tet to date. This was achieved by introducing fluorine substituents to Tet4, resulting in reaction rates at the 10&#8310;&#160;M&#8315;&#185;s&#8315;&#185; level while minimizing degradation. This study expands the toolbox of bioorthogonal reagents for Tet&#8208;sTCO&#8208;based, site&#8208;specific protein labeling and demonstrates that the Tet is a uniquely tunable, highly reactive, and encodable bioorthogonal functional group. These findings provide a foundation to further explore Tet encoding and reactivity.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light Catalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were synthesized for NIR&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM showed a CO evolution rate of 74.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, exceeding the performance of most NIR catalysts. PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM demonstrated unparalleled stability during cycling tests, yielding 344.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 CO in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction, demonstrating its potential for sustainable CO2 utilization.








Abstract
Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM leads to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR Reveals Reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cell Wall Due to a Host&#8208;Defence Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the mode of action is critical to develop new antifungal drugs. Solid&#8208;state NMR was used to study the reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall by a host&#8208;defence peptide. We identified specific polysaccharides and amino acids that are affected by the peptide. Our studies also suggest a mechanism on how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane, which may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.








Abstract
The limited availability of antifungal drug treatments and the rising issue of drug resistance highlight the urgent need for new antifungal drugs to combat drug&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The host&#8208;defence peptide cathelicidin&#8208;2 has demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on azole&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus but its mechanism of action remains elusive. We applied a tailored set 1H and 13C detected solid state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to elucidate the cell wall composition of Aspergillus fumigatus and to shed light on the mechanism of action of the peptide within the cell wall. Our results revealed that presence of the peptide affects galactosaminogalactan, an important component involved in the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, as well as other specific polysaccharides and amino acids within the mobile cell wall domain. At longer exposure times, the peptide also influences the rigid cell wall domains by enhancing water penetration into the hydrophobic rigid cell wall domain. The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.

The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Lewis Basicity in Oxide Lattice Oxygens: A Regulating Force for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis basicity of lattice oxygen is activated in our high entropy spinel oxide (LB&#8208;HEO). Through Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction, LB&#8208;HEO attracts acidic Li+, leading to more disorder and Li+ defects in the discharge product Li2O2 of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. This promotes Li+ diffusion in Li2O2 and interfacial electron transfer, eventually improving the decomposition kinetics during charging. It provides a new perspective on the regulation of Li+ behavior to achieve better electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) require fast oxygen conversion kinetics to achieve good cycling performance and high energy efficiency. In the text of catalysts for LOBs, the Lewis basicity of lattice oxygens (OL) in common transition metal oxides is often underestimated due to the weak electron donor characteristic of OL. In this work, a new spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxide with Lewis basicity (LB&#8208;HEO) was synthesized through a Joule&#8208;heating method. OL was activated by regulating the tetrahedral site&#8208;OL&#8208;octahedral site (MTd&#8208;OL&#8208;MOh) units in the spinel&#8208;type HEO, enhancing the LB. Used as a cathode catalyst for LOBs, LB&#8208;HEO could attract Li+ and increase the disorder in discharge product, lithium peroxide (Li2O2), promoting the delithiation process and the interfacial charge transfer at the LB&#8208;HEO|Li2O2 interface. The activation energy of interfacial charge transfer was significantly reduced from 63.5 to 22.4 kJ mol&#8722;1. As a result, a low charging overpotential of 0.97 V and a long cycling lifespan of 135 cycles at 100 mA g&#8722;1 were achieved with a capacity limitation of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. The strategy based on the regulation of Li+ behavior through its interaction with Lewis bases provides a promising prospect for the design of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Electronically Polarized Fe&#8208;N5 Catalysts Redirect Polymerization&#8208;Driven Phenolic Pollutant Removal Toward Sustainable Carbon Sequestration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;range electronically polarized Fe&#8208;N5 catalyst is developed, enabling specific and efficient peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;catalyst complex generation. BPA removal is redirected by tailored PMS complexes from conventional radical&#8208;mediated mineralization pathways to interfacial polymerization. A 4&#8211;668 times higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal than reported for iron&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) is achieved, with sustainable practical wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration observed (&gt;1700&#160;h operation).








Abstract
A sustainable strategy for simultaneous pollutant removal and carbon sequestration is offered by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;mediated electron transfer mechanism. However, it remains challenging to achieve catalysts with durable and high activity. A novel catalyst design strategy leveraging boron doping that induces long&#8208;range electronic polarization to precisely modulate PMS complexation dynamics on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is proposed in this study. It is demonstrated that B&#8208;doping induces asymmetric Fe&#8208;N5 coordination at the atomic iron centers (FeSA&#8208;BNC) while creating electron&#8208;enriched carbon auxiliary sites. The electron distribution is synergistically optimized by this dual&#8208;site configuration through lowering the d&#8208;band center and establishing a polarized charge transfer pathway. Complexes with enhanced oxidation potential are generated by the engineered FeSA&#8208;BNC/PMS, redirecting bisphenol A degradation from conventional radical&#8208;mediated mineralization to an interfacial polymerization pathway via outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer. Remarkably, &gt;3 times higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal activity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts and 4 orders of magnitude higher reactivity than conventional carbon nitride (CN) catalyst are exhibited by the optimized catalyst. Excellent operational stability (&gt;1700&#160;h continuous operation) with &gt;120&#160;L actual wastewater treatment capacity is demonstrated by practical implementation in a continuous&#8208;flow microreactor. This work advances electronic modulation strategies for sustainable water purification technologies.

The use of solution&#8208;processed amorphous zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrid (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films for direct X&#8208;ray detection is demonstrated. The amorphous films exhibit efficient molecular sensitization, with ZnBr42&#8722; species serving as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz&#8314; moieties as charge transporters. The resulting detectors achieve a detection sensitivity of 2165&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;V&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 6.01&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) are emerging materials with significant potential for optoelectronic applications, including direct X&#8208;ray detectors. While 0D OMHH single crystals exhibit excellent X&#8208;ray detection properties, their scalability remains a significant challenge due to the time&#8208;intensive growth process and difficulty in producing large single crystals exceeding a few centimeters. This limitation hinders their practicality for large&#8208;area detector applications. Here, we report for the first time the development of amorphous 0D OMHH films via solution processing for efficient direct X&#8208;ray detection. By reacting a non&#8208;crystalline organic halide, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phosphonium bromide (TPPCarzBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have successfully produced amorphous 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films with controlled thickness via facile solution processing. The organic cations (TPPCarz&#8314;) feature a lower bandgap than the ZnBr42&#8722; anions, enabling efficient molecular sensitization, where ZnBr42&#8722; anions serve as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz&#8314; cations as charge transporters. Direct X&#8208;ray detectors based on 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving a stable X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 2,165&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8315;1cm&#8315;2 at 20&#160;V&#160;mm&#8315;&#185; and a detection limit of 6.01&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8315;&#185;. The amorphous nature of these films enhances their processability, allowing for fabrication in various sizes and shapes, and making them highly adaptable for scalable detector applications.

Thioaryl hydroxycoumarins are versatile, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for both single&#8208;electron (SET), and energy transfer (EnT) pathways, enabling radical and triplet energy transfer reactions with a single organic scaffold.








Abstract
Bifunctional photocatalysts capable of mediating both single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (EnT) processes are rare and typically metal based. Here, we present 3&#8208;thioaryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, a new family of cost&#8208;effective organic photocatalysts that leverage a stabilized charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state to achieve both strong reducing power and efficient energy transfer. The spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO stabilizes the CT state, enhancing SET reactivity (E*red&#160;=&#160;&#8722;3.08&#160;V vs. SCE) while maintaining a sufficiently high triplet energy (ET&#160;=&#160;67 kcal mol&#8722;1) for EnT&#8208;driven transformations. This dual reactivity enables the activation of redox&#8208;inert substrates (Ered&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;2.8&#160;V vs. SCE) via SET reduction, generating radicals suitable for diverse C&#9472;S, C&#8208;&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations, alongside EnT&#8208;based processes such as E/Z olefin isomerization and [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloadditions. Mechanistic studies, supported by photophysical and theoretical analyses, confirmed the catalyst's bifunctionality.

         <title>Selection of Ribofuranose&#8208;Isomer Among Pentoses by Phosphorylation with Diamidophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate phosphorylates the four pentoses under mild aqueous conditions. Ribofuranosyl&#8208;cyclicphosphates are formed efficiently, while the other three pentoses react slowly to form furanosyl&#8208; and/or pyranosyl&#8208;forms. The selective formation of ribofuranosyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate occurs even when starting from a mixture of sugars suggesting an alternative pathway for abiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides in a prebiotic context.








Abstract
The unique structure&#8211;function relationship of the ribofuranose ring in RNA has inspired various chemical pathways to select for the ribofuranose form (over the ribopyranose form), especially in a prebiotic context. Herein we show that the reaction of diamidophosphate (DAP) with the four pentoses&#8212;ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose&#8212;naturally selects the ribofuranose form more efficiently when compared to the other three pentoses. All four pentoses form the initial diamidophosphate&#8208;adduct; however, ribose undergoes rapid conversion to ribofuranose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while the other three pentoses show significant accumulation of the initially formed DAP&#8208;adducts and slow conversion to the cyclicphosphate products. Arabinose and xylose show a distribution between furanose&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while lyxose forms the furanose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products. This trend is also manifested when starting from a mixture of pentoses where ribofuranose 1,2&#8208;amidocyclicphosphate dominates the product distribution. Such selection for ribofuranose among pentoses by phosphorylation i) provides another venue of how a ribofuranose structure can selectively emerge through abiotic chemical reaction suitable for elaboration toward RNA and ii) adds to the body of experimental work addressing the chemical origin of RNA.

         <title>Entire Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;I Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entire near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) ECL enhancement strategy of gold nanoclusters (NCx, x represents the ligand of gold nanoclusters) is reported by regulating absorption wavelength of gold nanorods to precisely match ECL emission wavelength of gold nanoclusters (NCxRy, y represents the longitudinal plasmon resonance absorption wavelength of the gold nanorods), and the ECL intensity of NCxRy is 3&#8211;4 times higher than that of individual NCx.








Abstract
Herein, entire near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) is achieved by continuously regulating the plasmon resonance absorption wavelength of gold nanorods (Au NRs) to precisely match ECL emission wavelength of Au NCs (abbreviated as Au NCs/Au NRs), which challenges the drawbacks of traditional single wavelength ECL enhancement strategy. Interestingly, within the range of 670&#8211;820&#160;nm, the ECL intensity of Au NCs/Au NRs is 3&#8211;4 times higher than that of individual Au NCs due to the acceleration of electron&#8208;hole recombination and radiation transition rate through high energy electromagnetic field. As a proof of concept, the Au NCs/Au NRs with the ECL emission of 670&#160;nm is employed as high&#8208;efficiency ECL emitter to achieve high&#8208;resolution ECL image and construct biosensor for realizing ultrasensitive detection of matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) related to liver failure. Significantly, the proposed ECL enhancement strategy effectively enhances the ECL emission of metal nanoclusters (M NCs) over a wide wavelength range and advances a new path for other tunable nanomaterials to enhance the ECL emission of M NCs, which is expected to be applied to in the field of multispectral ECL imaging, multimodal optoelectronic devices, and spectrum&#8208;resolved multiplexed biosensing systems.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Production of Ethylene from Bicarbonate Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report direct electroreduction of bicarbonate to C2+ products using Cu mesh catalysts. The effect of mesh thickness, pore size, catholyte composition, and thermal treatment was systematically studied. Our finding shows that thinner Cu mesh showed enhanced C2+ selectivity due to improved mass transport, while heat&#8208;treated meshes form oxide&#8208;derived surfaces that shift selectivity from hydrogen evolution to efficient eCO2R.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction directly from a reactive carbon solution (e.g., (bi)carbonate) provides a promising approach for integrating CO2 capture and conversion. Compared to CO2 conversion in gas&#8208;fed systems, this system typically suffers from low Faradaic efficiency (FE), especially for multicarbon (C2+) products. Here, we report an engineered material structuring to selectively produce C2+ products directly from a N2&#8208;saturated bicarbonate solution. Multiphysics modeling studies reveal the critical role of local current density distribution and the spatio&#8208;selective evolution of C2+ products, which is favored in thinner catalysts (240&#160;&#181;m thickness). By jointly tailoring catalyst configuration and mass transport in bicarbonate electroreduction, adjusting the thickness, porosity, and surface oxidation of copper (Cu) mesh catalysts, as well as catholyte composition, we achieved a maximum C2H4 FE of 39% and total C2+ FE over 55% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a 240&#160;&#181;m thick Cu mesh. The system is also stable for over 160&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with maintained C2H4 FE over 20%. Our electrolysis system converts bicarbonate to C2+ with over 90% CO2 utilization efficiency, reducing regeneration and separation costs. Optimizing catalyst pore structure, and copper surface oxide is a key to maximizing C2H4 production from bicarbonate solutions.

         <dc:description>
The release of ring strain in cyclo&#8208;Pn3 (Pn&#160;= P, As) ligands is exploited to achieve insertion of arsenium ions [R2As]+ (R&#160;=&#160;organic substituent) into non&#8208;polar bonds. This concept is utilized to access complexes bearing exotic cyclo&#8208;Pn3AsR2 ligands. Quantum crystallography and computational analysis shed light on the key energetic contributions unlocking this fundamental mode of reactivity.

Although it marks a cornerstone of pnictogenium ion [R2Pn]+ reactivity, the insertion of arsenium ions [R2As]+ into non&#8208;polar bonds remains highly challenging. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed, which circumvents the limitations of insertion reactivity of [R2As]+ (e.g., formal redox state of&#160;+V at As) via alleviation of ring strain in the substrate. Thus, unlocking arsenium ion bond insertion delivers the ring&#8208;expanded complexes [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8208;Pn3AsCy2][TEF] ({LnM}&#160;=&#160;Cp&#8244;Ni, Pn&#160;= P (1); {LnM}&#160;=&#160;{CpMo(CO)2}, Pn&#160;= P (2), As (5); Cp&#8244;&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;tBu3C5H2, [TEF]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;). Computational analysis of the reaction mechanism and quantum crystallographic investigation of 1 highlight the release of ring strain as the crucial driving force for this reactivity. This rational is corroborated by the isolation of the arsenium ion coordinated [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;P2AsCy2)][TEF] (3) as well as the phosphenium ion inserted [{CpMo(CO)2}(&#951;3&#8208;As3PPh2)][TEF] (4).

&lt;p&gt;The release of ring strain in &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-Pn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Pn&#160;= P, As) ligands is exploited to achieve insertion of arsenium ions [R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;As]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (R&#160;=&#160;organic substituent) into non-polar bonds. This concept is utilized to access complexes bearing exotic &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-Pn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ligands.

         <title>Dynamically Dual&#8208;Center Coupled Synergistic Catalysis for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism with multi&#8208;pathway for thorough oxygen reduction process in alkaline medium is demonstrated. In situ synchrotron infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations collectively reveal that the Pt single sites optimize the electronic structure of the PdRh nanosheets, thereby enhancing the overall oxygen reduction efficiency on PdRh&#9472;Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) suffers from inherent kinetic limitations arising from the competitive adsorption behavior of *OOH intermediates and their divergent conversion pathways toward either the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant route or the 2e&#8315;&#8208;peroxide byproduct. Conventional single&#8208;component catalysts fundamentally lack temporal&#8208;spatial control to simultaneously accelerate O&#9472;O bond cleavage while suppressing *H2O2 desorption. To overcome this kinetic dilemma, herein, we propose a dynamically dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism enabled by precisely engineered PdRh&#9472;Pt nanosheet binary&#8208;component interfaces. Multidimensional in situ synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the activated 4e&#8315; pathway primarily occurs at PdRh sites. Additionally, Pt centers selectively reduce *OOH to *O and *H2O2, whereas neighboring PdRh sites facilitate ultrafast *H2O2 migration and dissociation, effectively complementing the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant pathway. Hence, the DCCS catalysis redirects traditionally divergent product pathways toward a singular target product. This interfacial kinetic synergy achieves ultrahigh 4e&#8315; kinetics, demonstrated by a six&#8208;fold increase of turnover frequency compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the derived rechargeable Zn&#8210;air batteries demonstrate exceptional stability over 200&#160;h, establishing a new design principle for breaking kinetics trade&#8208;offs in heterogeneous catalysis through molecularly scheduling reaction pathways.

         <title>Chiral Cryptographic Key&#8208;Based Fluorescence Encryption Enabled by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

A chiral fluorescent MOF with lock&#8208;and&#8208;key responsiveness to PEA enantiomers is reported. Integrated into a flexible sensor, it enables visual detection of enantiomeric excess. Leveraging PEA enantiomers as cryptographic keys, a quadruply encrypted barcode system is developed, representing a first demonstration of high&#8208;security chiral encryption.








Abstract
Increasing threats of data forgery breaches necessitate the development of advanced encryption strategies beyond traditional cryptographic methods. Fluorescence encryption has emerged as a promising alternative, yet current systems suffer from low security due to simple, reversible stimuli responses. Here, we introduce a novel lock&#8208;and&#8208;key encryption system using a chiral cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic framework (CDMOF), termed Zole@CDMOF (Zole&#160;=&#160;acetylated benzoimidazole), for enantioselective discrimination of phenylethylamine (PEA) enantiomers.Confined Zole serves as the lock, while PEA enantiomers act as the key, selectively triggering fluorescence turn&#8208;on via acetyl&#9472;O bond cleavage and restoring excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of deacetylated Zole. Mechanistic studies reveal that enantioselectivity arises from thermodynamic differences and distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between PEA enantiomers. To enhance practical application, Zole@CDMOF is fabricated into a flexible sensor via scotch tape strategy, enabling visual indexing of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, we propose a barcode chiral encryption model, establishing a quadruply encrypted system with ultra&#8208;high security&#8212;allowing only one out of approximately two million keys to decrypt. This study pioneers the first chiral cryptographic key in fluorescence encryption, paving the way for ultra&#8208;secure encryption, advanced chiral sensing, and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8211;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4.








Abstract
Rational design of water activation center to promote active hydrogen (*H) generation and stabilize Cu(I) species are significant for the formation of multicarbon (C2+) products over Cu&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, CeO2 nanograins and CuO nanothorns were selectively deposited on the edges of Cu2O cubes through the seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8211;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4. This work provides new insights into modulating *H absorption and stabilizing Cu(I) species for boosting CO2 to C2+ products.

         <title>A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Activated Tumor&#8208;Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection</title>

An ROS&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe based on FDA&#8208;approved dye was developed using a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. Benefiting from the robust tumor&#8208;targeting ability and efficient ROS response performance, the proposed probe enabled tumor detection across various mice models and allowed for precise delineation of tumor boundaries during surgical navigation, significantly reducing postoperative recurrence in situ. 








Abstract
Optical molecular imaging with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe (termed MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin&#8208;targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS&#8208;responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high&#8208;contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (&#8764;3&#160;mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.

         <title>Ultrathin PtSe2 Nanowires in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, and expose abundant zigzag edges, which contribute to the higher catalytic activity for HER. The as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent HER activity at extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Platinum selenide (PtSe2) has shown great potential for application in electrocatalysis. One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures are particularly advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance, as they expose abundant active sites at the edges and enable rapid charge transport. However, the synthesis of 1D PtSe2 nanostructures for efficient electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of ultrathin (0.4&#8211;2.0&#160;nm) PtSe2 nanowires (NWs) using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a confined template via direct selenization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The atom&#8208;resolved electron microscope combined with spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, possessing zigzag edges and higher thermodynamical stability. Owing to the rich&#8208;edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low&#8208;cost and efficient Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the future.

         <title>A Macrocycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Strategy for Interchangeable Screwdriver&#8208;Like on&#8208;Demand Post&#8208;Functionalization of Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform that can be varied for customized applications is achieved through macrocyclic host&#8211;guest interactions. Such a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based COF with introduction of variable functional guests following the working principle of an interchangeable screwdriver. Conceptually different from traditional covalent approach, this work presents interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COF for applications through host&#8211;guest interactions.








Abstract
Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post&#8208;functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time&#8208;consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs. Moreover, their functions are difficult to change once the functionalities are covalently attached to COF skeletons. Herein, we report a macrocycle&#8208;based supramolecular strategy for variable noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform like an interchangeable screwdriver. As a proof of concept, pillar[5]arene (P5A) with electron&#8208;rich cavity is incorporated into COF as macrocycle host to anchor different electron&#8208;deficient guests of various functions. Such a design allows tunable post&#8208;functionalization of COF through host&#8211;guest interactions for customized utilities, which has been demonstrated by using a series of guests including organic salts for iodine capture and cyano&#8208;based ligands for metal ion separation. Removing the guests enables recycling of COF, consecutive reinstallation of different guests, and continuous use for implementing expected tasks. This work establishes a general noncovalent approach to on&#8208;demand interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COFs.

         <title>Twelvefold Dearomative Esterification of (6,6)Carbon Nanobelt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carbon nanobelt derivative bearing twelve ester groups has been successfully synthesized from fully conjugated (6,6)carbon nanobelt by the unique Mg&#8208;promoted dearomative esterification. This simple yet powerful method can modulate shape, solubility and host&#8211;guest property of the (6,6)carbon nanobelt. 








Abstract
Carbon nanobelts (CNBs), cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with belt&#8208;shaped topologies, have growing interest as structurally unique and optoelectronically promising nanocarbons. Yet, strategies for their direct and site&#8208;selective functionalization remain scarce. Here, we report a magnesium&#8208;mediated, multifold dearomative esterification of (6,6)CNB, enabling the installation of twelve ester groups in a single transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed regioselective dearomatization patterns, whereas mechanistic studies uncovered a radical&#8208;driven pathway involving oxyiminium intermediate generated in situ from alkyl chloroformates and amide solvents. Computational analysis further indicated that strain release in the CNB framework drives the high degree of functionalization. This methodology not only expands the synthetic toolbox for aromatic nanobelts but also allows tunable modulation of their host&#8211;guest properties via enhanced conformational flexibility.

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Activatable PROTAC Prodrug for Tumor Biomarker&#8208;Driven Near&#8208;Infrared Opto&#8208;Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) is developed to stepwisely activate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and proteolytic activity in the presence of tumor biomarker enzyme Cathepsin B (CatB) and NIR light. TAP represents the first tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC approach under a collaborative control by endogenous and exogenous triggers, holding great promise for precise spatiotemporal on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor&#8208;homing cyclopeptide through a tandem&#8208;locking linker, which comprises a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) cleavable moiety, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor&#8208;selective degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem&#8208;activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off&#8208;tumor toxicity of PROTAC.

&lt;p&gt;A tandem-activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) is developed to stepwisely activate near-infrared (NIR) emission, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and proteolytic activity in the presence of tumor biomarker enzyme Cathepsin B (CatB) and NIR light. TAP represents the first tandem-activatable PROTAC approach under a collaborative control by endogenous and exogenous triggers, holding great promise for precise spatiotemporal on-tumor proteolysis in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor-specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem-activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on-tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor-homing cyclopeptide through a tandem-locking linker, which comprises a singlet-oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) cleavable moiety, a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)-cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem-lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor-selective degradation of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem-activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off-tumor toxicity of PROTAC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Engineered Proton Transfer Pathways for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a rationally designed catalyst integrating Ni single atoms and NiO nanoclusters on porous carbon nanosheets for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis in solid electrolytes. This catalyst achieves 97% Faradaic efficiency and 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for pure H2O2 production. The study addresses a critical gap in elucidating proton transfer pathways in solid electrolytes during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SE) cells promise electrochemical synthesis of pure hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) remain unclear when using&#160;pure water as the proton source. Both Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H&#8208;mediated) and Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER, water&#8208;derived proton&#8208;coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, but their practical dominance under SE conditions lacks experimental validation. Herein, we designed a hierarchical Ni&#9472;N2&#9472;C&#9472;O single&#8208;atom/NiO nanocluster co&#8208;decorated porous carbon nanosheet catalyst (NiSA&#8208;NiO/pCNs) that achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a H2O2 partial current density of 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 (equivalent to 6.6&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 production rate) in a porous SE cell. Analysis of reaction intermediates and the local pH using in situ Raman spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect, and density functional theory simulations showed the critical role of NiO nanoclusters in tuning the protonation pathway: NiO activates the ER mechanism via fast proton transfer from water dissociation, whereas NiSA/pCNs without NiO preferentially follow the LH mechanism through surface&#8208;adsorbed *H intermediates from interfacial transferred proton. These findings establish a catalyst design principle for proton transfer control in solid&#8208;state H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Defect Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tandem CO2 Electroreduction and Carbonylation Reactions from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;system tandem approach&#8212;comprising a membrane separation CO&#8322; system, a CO&#8322; reduction reaction system, and a carbonylation reaction system&#8212;directly converts flue gas to high&#8208;value&#8208;added organic chemicals, establishing a practical paradigm for sustainable chemical manufacturing that simultaneously addresses challenges in carbon capture, renewable energy storage, and green synthesis of fine chemicals. 








Abstract
Tandem CO2 reduction with carbonylation reactions represents a promising approach to convert greenhouse gases into valuable chemicals. Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;N/O mixed pre&#8208;coordination pyrolysis&#8221; strategy to construct vacancy&#8208;defect single atom catalysts (Ni1&#8208;, Mn1&#8208;, Fe1&#8208;, Co1&#8208;, and Cu1&#8208;NC) with M&#8208;N3 coordination microenvironment. This vacancy&#8208;defect endows Ni1&#8208;NC with excellent performance for CO2 electroreduction, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% across a wide range of current densities up to 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The generated CO was directly fed to carbonylation reactions, producing organic chemicals with yields of up to 91.7% and leading to produce 1.13&#160;g of benzophenone in a single run. For the first time, the membrane separation CO2 system was integrated with tandem catalytic system, enabling direct utilization of flue gas for benzophenone synthesis with a 76.6% yield. This work offers a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly method for CO2 separation and utilization by feeding industrial waste gas to carbonylation reactions.

         <title>S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn Alloy Hollow Microbox for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under cathodic potential, Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 hollow microboxes undergo in&#8208;situ reduction and reconstruction to form S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn alloy hollow microboxes, which greatly promote the electrochemical CO&#8322;RR to produce formate.








Abstract
The dynamic catalyst's restructuring creates a new catalytic surface that is essential for boosting the efficiency of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work, we synthesize Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 hollow microboxes using a coprecipitation method followed by a hydrothermal treatment. Based on a collection of in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations including in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, rapid freeze&#8208;quench (RFQ) 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we discover that the Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 (Ag@SnS2) hollow microboxes undergo dynamic reduction and reconstruction during the electrochemical CO2RR, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn alloy (S&#8208;Ag3Sn/Sn) hollow microboxes. This transformation results in a remarkable formate selectivity of 92.4% with a formate partial current density of 97.3 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in an H&#8208;cell. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both S&#8208;doping and Ag&#8211;Sn alloying enhance the CO2 adsorption and improve the stability of *OCHO intermediate. This work offers a facile strategy for designing highly active and selective electrocatalyst for CO2RR.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adapting Lattice Respiration Enabled by Crystal Design and d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization Toward Highly Stable Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the dual considerations of crystal structure and electronic structure, we construct cathodes with &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration (SALR)&#8221; effect. The effect effectively addresses the poor cycle stability of transition metal&#8208;based RABs cathodes caused by the strong electrostatic interaction between high charge density Al3+ and host lattice. 








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the appealing three&#8208;electron transfer feature, low cost, and high safety. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and host lattice induces severe lattice distortion and structural collapse, leading to poor cycle stability in RABs. Herein, we develop a new&#8208;type FeWO4 cathode with a comprehensive consideration of the crystal structure and electronic structure. The 3D open framework and strong W&#9472;O covalent network of the FeWO4 greatly improve the storage of high charge density Al3+. Moreover, the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen facilitates electron delocalization, which effectively weakens the interaction with the trivalent cation (Al3+). Importantly, combining in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that as&#8208;prepared cathode exhibits a &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration&#8221; (SALR) effect. Specifically, the reversible W&#8211;O bond elongation/compression (&#916;d&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.05&#160;&#197;) during cycling reduces lattice strain and confines volume expansion to less than 3%. As results, the FeWO4 cathode delivers a high capacity of 192&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and long cycle life of over 2300 cycles with quiet low capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle in RABs.

&lt;p&gt;Based on the dual considerations of crystal structure and electronic structure, we construct cathodes with &#8220;self-adapting lattice respiration (SALR)&#8221; effect. The effect effectively addresses the poor cycle stability of transition metal-based RABs cathodes caused by the strong electrostatic interaction between high charge density Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and host lattice. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are promising for large-scale energy storage due to the appealing three-electron transfer feature, low cost, and high safety. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and host lattice induces severe lattice distortion and structural collapse, leading to poor cycle stability in RABs. Herein, we develop a new-type FeWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode with a comprehensive consideration of the crystal structure and electronic structure. The 3D open framework and strong W&#9472;O covalent network of the FeWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; greatly improve the storage of high charge density Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen facilitates electron delocalization, which effectively weakens the interaction with the trivalent cation (Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). Importantly, combining in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that as-prepared cathode exhibits a &#8220;self-adapting lattice respiration&#8221; (SALR) effect.

         <title>Deciphering Tryptophan Oxygenation: Key Modulators of 2&#8208;Oxindole Formation in MarE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that MarE, a heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenase, favors dioxygenation of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan in the absence of ascorbate and demonstrates how structural and redox tuning shifts its reactivity toward selective monooxygenation, yielding a 2&#8208;oxindole scaffold. These findings offer new insights into enzyme&#8208;controlled indole oxidation in tryptophan&#8208;derived natural products.








Abstract
MarE, a heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenase with a histidyl axial ligation, catalyzes the monooxygenation of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan to form a 2&#8208;oxindole scaffold central to maremycin biosynthesis. Although structurally similar to tryptophan 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (TDO), which initiates l&#8208;tryptophan catabolism via dioxygenation, MarE exhibits distinct reactivity modulated by ascorbate. While ascorbate has no effect on TDO, it promotes selective monooxygenation by MarE. In its absence, MarE favors dioxygenation and formation of pyrroloindoline products, revealing latent catalytic versatility. Active&#8208;site loop sequences differ between the two enzymes, SLGGR in MarE versus GTGGS in TDO, prompting loop&#8208;swapping experiments to probe structure&#8208;function relationships. Substituting GTGGS in TDO to MarE&#8208;like sequences (GTGGA or SLGGS) shifted reactivity toward monooxygenation and formation of C3&#8208;hydroxylated, non&#8208;oxindole products that underwent further cyclization into tricyclic structures. Conversely, replacing SLGGR in MarE with GTGGS resulted in enhanced C2,C3&#8208;dioxygenation nearly 4&#8208;fold. These results underscore the active&#8208;site loop as a key determinant of oxidation outcome, alongside the modulatory role of ascorbate. By revealing the true catalytic identity of MarE and delineating the roles of small&#8208;molecule effectors and loop architecture, this study advances mechanistic understanding and predictive capabilities within the oxygenase superfamily.

         <title>Stable Acrylamide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via Mannich Polymerization for Efficient Gold Recovery from Complex E&#8208;Waste Leachates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acrylamide&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized through a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization. The resulting frameworks feature irreversible linkages, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and dual C&#9552;O/N&#9472;H coordination sites, enabling exceptional stability and highly selective gold recovery from complex electronic waste leachates.








Abstract
Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization involving 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene, Meldrum's acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide&#8208;linked COFs (TFB&#8208;PD&#8208;M, TFB&#8208;ND&#8208;M, and TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C&#9552;O and N&#9472;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.

         <title>Confining Asymmetrically Coordinated Cobalt Single&#8208;Atoms/Clusters on Holey MXene for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dual&#8208;coordination microenvironment strategy, CoN1O2 single atoms and Co nanoclusters (NCs) were confined within highly graphitized carbon layers supported on holey MXene nanosheets. The Co NCs optimized the electronic structure of Co active centers, synergistically enhancing peroxymonosulfate adsorption and electron transfer efficiency. A nonradical electron transfer mechanism was proposed to drive the polymerization of bisphenol A.








Abstract
Developing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with asymmetric coordination configurations is essential for enhancing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, precisely regulating the electronic structure and coordination environment of metal centers to further improve activation kinetics remains a key challenge. Herein, we designed asymmetric CoN1O2 single atoms (SAs) sites and Co nanoclusters (NCs) that were spatially confined in highly graphitized carbon layers and supported on holey MXene nanosheet (CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX) via a dual&#8208;coordination microenvironment strategy. The CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance on bisphenol A (BPA) removal, achieving a corrected rate constant (kvalue) of 2750 min&#8722;1 M&#8722;1 and a total organic carbon removal efficiency of 78.2%. Mechanistic studies revealed that BPA removal was dominated by a nonradical electron transfer process (ETP, &#8764;100%), which facilitated rapid polymerization of BPA. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that Co NCs synergistically enhanced the ability of asymmetric CoN1O2 SAs sites to adsorb and activate PMS, significantly accelerating interfacial charge transfer. Furthermore, a catalytic membrane fabricated by crosslinking of CoSA&#8208;NC/H20MX and graphene achieved 100% BPA removal in single&#8208;pass mode with a hydraulic retention time of just 40&#160;ms over 24&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides new insights into designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for pollutant removal via ETP&#8208;driven polymerization pathways.

Under the synergistic catalysis of an 8&#8208;OIQ cobalt catalyst and CH3CN, a series of&#160;E&#8208; and&#160;Z&#8208;alkenes with high stereoselectivity could be synthesized in the semihydrogenation of internal alkynes. Mechanistic studies showed that the acetonitrile plays an important role in controlling isomerization and inhabiting over&#8208;hydrogenation during the conversion process.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes is one of the most efficient, sustainable, and environmental&#8208;friendly strategies for accessing stereoisomerically pure olefins. Herein, we report a tridentate nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand (8&#8208;OIQ) promoted cobalt&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent semihydrogenation of internal alkynes; a series of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;alkenes could be synthesized with high stereoselectivity. Besides, this protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and operates under mild reaction conditions (1&#160;bar H2, room temperature). A preliminary mechanistic study revealed that acetonitrile plays an important role in suppressing over&#8208;reduction and controlling the stereoselectivity in this transformation.

         <title>Sulfur Mediated Interfacial Proton&#8208;Directed Transfer Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia over Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;mediated electron redistribution and proton&#8208;directed transfer at the Cu&#8208;Co interface significantly boost electrocatalytic NO reduction to NH3 over the S&#8208;Cu@Co/C catalyst. The changes in the electronic structure of Cu and Co promote NO adsorption and water dissociation. Meanwhile, sulfur accelerates the transfer of protons generated at Co sites to Cu sites, thereby facilitating NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a sustainable strategy that simultaneously realizes the nitrogen cycle and resource integration. The key issue hindering the NORR efficiency is accelerating proton (*H) transfer to facilitate NO hydrogenation while inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate an interface&#8208;engineered sulfur&#8208;mediated Cu@Co electrocatalyst (S&#8208;Cu@Co/C) that boosts NORR performance through dual modulation of electronic structure and proton transfer on active sites. A comprehensive program of experimental and theoretical calculations was employed to discover that sulfur incorporation induces electron redistribution in the Cu&#8211;Co interface, creating electron&#8208;rich sulfur and electron&#8208;deficient metals. This electronic configuration synergistically enhances NO adsorption on Cu sites and promotes water dissociation on Co sites. More critically, sulfur could direct the rapid transfer of *H from Co to Cu sites, thereby accelerating the NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER. Consequently, S&#8208;Cu@Co/C achieves an NH3 yield rate of 655.3 &#181;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.4% in an H&#8208;cell. Remarkably, the catalyst could maintain continuous electrolysis tests and steady NH3 yield up to 100&#160;h. This work provides innovative insights into the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts via heteroatom&#8208;mediated interfacial engineering strategies.

         <title>Asymmetric, Corner&#8208;Sharing CuO5 and CuO6 Motifs in Cu&#8208;Based Metallic Perovskite Oxides Boosting Asymmetric C&#9472;C Coupling for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>

         <dc:description>
A unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with asymmetric, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs were reported to promote asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; was the most effective Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalyst for C2+ production and performed comparably with or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides feature significant potential for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) but encounter insufficient C2+ selectivity primarily due to the inherent symmetric charge distribution at Cu sites hindering asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling. Here we report a unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with asymmetric, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs to boost asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst of La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, their ordered, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 pyramids and CuO6 octahedra feature localized charge density redistribution, creating abundant asymmetric Cu&#9472;Cu dual sites with distinct electronic structures and also strengthening Cu&#9472;O covalency. In CO2RR (in both alkaline and acidic media), La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; greatly promotes C2+ formation while producing negligible CH4, showing a Faradaic efficiency ratio (C2+ to CH4) of up to 180. Moreover, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, achieving a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 85.0% at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, together with well&#8208;boosted stability, outperforms previously reported Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalysts. Our experiments and theoretical calculations attribute the superb performance mainly to the following factors: the asymmetric CuO5&#9472;CuO6 sites promoting differentiated *CO adsorption/hydrogenation to favor asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling; the strengthened Cu&#9472;O covalency stabilizing the Cu sites. Extending this strategy to two additional pairs of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides generates similarly successful results.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Copper Cluster Nanoreactor for Efficient Catalysis in Chemical Fixation of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>

         <dc:description>
An atomically precise I@Cu8 cluster with high thermal/chemical stability represents the first example of a cluster&#8208;based nanoreactor that demonstrates excellent catalytic activity in chemical fixation of both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols with CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations due to the unique substrate enrichment of well&#8208;defined nanocavities.








Abstract
Chemical fixation of CO2 with propargylic amines/alcohols into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals represents promising and practical routes for CO2 resource utilization, but it remains a great challenge to achieve low&#8208;concentration CO2 conversion in both reactions through one single catalytic system. Herein, a robust copper cluster [(C6H15NH)(Cu8L8I)] (I@Cu8) with nanosized cavities has been constructed. Importantly, the I@Cu8 cluster as a nanoreactor can efficiently catalyze the chemical conversion of both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols with CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, due to the unique substrate enrichment effect of its well&#8208;defined nanocavities. Catalytic mechanism investigation and DFT calculations illustrate that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the simultaneous activation of alkynyl (&#9472;C&#8801;CH) bonds and amino/hydroxyl (&#9472;NHR/&#9472;OH) groups in the I@Cu8 catalytic system, in which the I@Cu8&#8208;substrate intermediates have been confirmed through ESI&#8208;MS analysis. Impressively, this is the first example of a cluster&#8208;based nanoreactor catalyst for low&#8208;concentration CO2 cyclization reactions with both propargylic amines and propargylic alcohols. This work provides a foundation for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 conversion into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Suppressing Halide Segregation of Wide Bandgap Perovskite by Interface Molecular Coordination for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

The pretreatment of the hole transport layer with p&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (PXA) effectively improves the crystallization quality of the bottom interface of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite, reduces interfacial defects, and suppresses bromine&#8211;iodine phase segregation, ultimately enabling the fabrication of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 28.65% under standard air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight.








Abstract
Hole transporting layers made by self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) are emerging as promising hole transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells, owing to their reduced parasitic absorption and effective carrier extraction. However, perovskite films grown on HTM substrates typically exhibit a high defect density, which adversely affects device performance. In this study, we investigated the film growth kinetics of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite on monolayer material substrates and uncovered a halide phase segregation in the initial nucleation stage during crystal growth kinetics at the interface, which brings small grain sizes and significant lattice strain within the perovskite film. To address this issue, we introduced a biphosphate&#8208;substituted molecule on the HTM surface to coordinate with PbBr2 that suppresses halide phase segregation, leading to improved crystallographic orientation and a reduction in defect density. As a result, the wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77&#160;eV) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.35&#160;V, while tandem devices reached an impressive efficiency of 28.65%.

         <title>A 3.8&#160;V Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery Enabled by a Conjugated Ladder Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a conjugated ladder polymer, poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), as an efficient anode material to store NR4+, and construct a record&#8208;high voltage 3.8&#160;V NR4+&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) by matching the BBL anode with a graphite cathode. The resultant DIB shows a maximum energy/power density up to 232&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1/6865&#160;W kg&#8722;1 based on graphite mass, superior rate performance, and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on nonmetal charge carriers like NH4+ recently have attracted intensive attention due to high safety, environmental friendliness, low cost, and fast kinetics. However, NH4+ electrolytes suffer from a narrow electrochemical potential window, making it challenging to construct high&#8208;voltage and energy&#8208;dense devices. Here we report a quaternary ammonium (NR4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) working at a high voltage of 3.8&#160;V, which was enabled by a conjugated ladder polymer poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) anode for NR4+ storage and a graphite cathode for anion uptake. The BBL functions as an efficient NR4+ host by carbonyl/enol transformation, delivering a high capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1, low average potential, high stability, and excellent rate performance. In the redox process, the electronic and ionic conductivities of BBL change periodically, accompanied by the formation of radical anion (&#9679;&#8722;) and diradical dianion (2&#9679;&#8722;). In combination with an anion&#8208;intercalation graphite cathode, the assembled graphite//BBL DIB exhibits a maximum energy/power density up to 232&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 6865&#160;W kg&#8722;1 based on mass of graphite, superior rate performance, and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of NR4+ as cation carrier and its efficient host, which will inspire novel designs for high&#8208;performance nonmetallic energy storage devices.

Porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing the formation of ammonia and hydrogen byproducts.








Abstract
Cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration NO is important but suffers from low Faraday efficiency and current density because of severe competitive hydrogen and ammonia evolution reactions. Here, porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies reveal that porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing ammonia and hydrogen formation. This work paves the way for accessing low&#8208;concentration gaseous reactants for various catalytic reactions.

         <title>A Bioinspired Diazafluorenone Catalytic System for Aerobic Oxidative Deamination of Primary Amines</title>

A highly efficient biomimetic aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino amides and benzylamines into &#945;&#8208;keto amides and aromatic aldehydes is enabled by 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), a new organocatalyst with a simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity.








Abstract
Copper amine oxidases (CAOs) catalyze aerobic oxidation of primary amines into carbonyl compounds, which is an important biological process as well as a useful transformation for organic synthesis. A new bioinspired organocatalyst, 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), has been discovered, which exhibits impressive characteristics, including simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity, enabling it to effectively mimic the function of copper amine oxidases. Oxidative deamination of &#945;&#8208;amino amides presents an attractive approach to access &#945;&#8208;keto amides; however, it is difficult to achieve due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric effect. The diazafluorenone displays high catalytic activity in this transformation, producing various biologically significant &#945;&#8208;keto amides in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the diazafluorenone catalyst is able to promote direct oxidation of benzylamines into aromatic aldehydes, instead of the generally formed product&#8208;reactant imines, which leads to no greater than 50% yields of the desired aldehydes. The current aerobic oxidative deamination proceeds via a pathway similar to the biological process, involving transamination, hydrolysis/aminolysis, and aerobic oxidation.

By virtue of the efficient coupling of multilevel chiroptical activity with high optical gain, the chiral organic supramolecular microcrystals exhibit circularly polarized laser outputs with dissymmetry factors up to &#8764;1.3 and quantum yields close to 100%.








Abstract
Chiral organic materials are rapidly emerging as a promising platform for circularly polarized lasing. However, the lag in mechanistic research has severely hindered the development of organic circularly polarized lasers. Here, we attempt to probe multilevel chiroptical activity in organic supramolecular microcrystals for exploring high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. The evolution of chiroptical activity is tracked spanning from chiral molecular monomers to dimers to supramolecular helices. The crucial roles of excimers and supramolecular helices in achieving high optical gain and large chiroptical activity are revealed. Accordingly, circularly polarized lasing with low thresholds and large dissymmetry factors is realized in the organic supramolecular microcrystals. Our work marks the beginning of mechanistic research on chirality induced circularly polarized lasing, which will initiate the rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Orthogonal Multiple Hydrogen Bonds of Nucleobases Enable Precise Tunability of DNA&#8208;Polymer Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple hydrogen bond (MHB) interactions for hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNA chains are highly selective and orthogonal, owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity. Orthogonal MHBs enable us to tailor DNA nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic domain, amplifying the production of diverse functional DNA nanostructures.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures manifest enhanced stability and chemical diversity for various applications such as sensing, imaging, and immune modulation. However, the functionality of the hydrophobic polymer in the core is often disregarded, leading to limited property tunability of DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures. Herein, we have successfully fabricated tunable DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures by harnessing orthogonal multiple hydrogen bonds (MHBs) within both the core and shell domains. Distinct DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures, consisting of hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNAs, have been rationally designed and successfully constructed. The DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures undergo the controlled morphological transformation triggered by hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and surface functionalization by hydrophilic DNA chains. Owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity, the robust MHB interactions for complementary DNAs and nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers are highly selective and orthogonal. Most significantly, the reported core&#8208;driven morphological transformation and surface functionalization of the shell layer are general to expand the structural and properties tunability of DNA nanostructures with different DNA sequences. This work provides an efficient and novel route to precisely modulating DNA&#8208;polymer core&#8208;shell nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic core through orthogonal MHBs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Blocking Strategy Boosts H2S Tolerance in Platinum&#8208;Based Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the S&#8208;contained poisoning intermediates formed on pure Pt could be limited on PtRu alloy to enhance the H2S tolerance in hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cells, which originates from the site&#8208;blocking effect and electronic tuning effect induced by Ru.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) show great potential for energy conversion, but their platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts are easily and irreversibly poisoned by trace impurities like H2S, causing performance degradation with unclear mechanisms. Here, combining in situ Raman spectroscopy with theoretical calculations, we found that on pure Pt surfaces, H2S dissociates into S* and HS* intermediates that occupy active sites of continuous Pt atoms in an acidic solution under 50&#160;ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere. However, on PtRu alloy surfaces, while *OH species were observed on Ru sites, no sulfur&#8208;containing species were detected on Pt sites. Comparative experiments revealed that the sulfur&#8208;related Raman peaks of PtRu exhibited a redshift compared to Pt, indicating that Ru alloying weakens the *S adsorption on Pt sites through electronic effects. These results demonstrate that Ru not only creates discontinuous Pt sites to block sulfur adsorption but also significantly weakens sulfur binding through electronic modulation. Based on these insights, small&#8208;sized site&#8208;blocking PtRu/C catalysts were developed, exhibiting only 9.2% activity decay after 700s in 50&#160;ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere, a 4.3&#8208;fold improvement over commercial Pt/C catalysts (39.3% decay). This work provides fundamental understanding of H2S poisoning mechanisms and practical guidelines for designing robust, poison&#8208;resistant catalysts.

         <title>Intermolecular Sp3C&#9472;H Metalation of Non&#8208;Nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted Bases Using Simple Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M&#9552;Al or Ga, X&#9552;Cl, Br or I) effect the sp3C&#9472;H metalation of a number of hindered bases, including the ubiquitous non&#8208;nucleophilic 2,6&#8208;ditertbutyl substituted pyridine/pyrimidines. Mechanistic studies indicate a frustrated Lewis pair mechanism requiring singly halide&#8208;bridged super&#8208;electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low C&#9472;H metalation barriers.








Abstract
2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted pyridines (tBu2&#8208;py) are widely used non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases. Their ubiquity is due to their highly hindered basic site and chemically robust nature. Herein we report that simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M&#9552;Al or Ga, X&#9552;Cl, Br or I) effect intermolecular sp3C&#9472;H metalation of tBu2&#8208;py bases under mild conditions. The sp3C&#9472;H metalated products can be converted in situ into &#9472;BPin, &#9472;iodo, &#9472;bromo and &#9472;hydroxy derivatives for further elaboration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that: i) a frustrated Lewis pair effects sp3C&#9472;H heterolysis to form the C&#9472;M bond and a protonated pyridine; ii) C&#9472;H metalation requires singly halide&#8208;bridged super&#8208;electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low barriers. Finally, sp3C&#9472;H metalation using M2X6 is not limited to tBu2&#8208;py bases. Thus, it is important to be aware of this facile sp3C&#9472;H functionalisation when using a range of non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases.

         <title>Is the Smallest Molecular Trefoil Knot Actually the Tightest One?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a modular self&#8208;assembly strategy has enabled the successful synthesis of a new family of molecular trefoil knots with varied backbone&#8208;atom numbers. An interesting odd&#8208;even effect of alkyl chain linkers on their tightness was demonstrated, which not only provides key insights into size&#8208;tightness relationships but also guides further development of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials. 








Abstract
Tightness engineering has evolved as an efficient strategy for the design of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials with desired properties and functions since tightness is a primary parameter that determines the property of a knotted strand. However, as an attractive topic that inspires mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists, whether the smallest knot is exactly the tightest one remains unaddressed experimentally. To tackle this challenge, a series of organic trefoil knots with the backbone&#8208;atom as short as 70 have been successfully synthesized by developing a new modular self&#8208;assembly approach in this study. To our great surprise, with the help of gradient tandem mass spectrometry, the quantitative tightness evaluation suggested that the molecular trefoil knot with a backbone crossing ratio (BCR) of 24.0 is even tighter than the one with a BCR of 23.3 (i.e., the smallest organic trefoil knot with the shortest ropelength synthesized so far), thus demonstrating an unexpected yet interesting odd&#8208;even effect to enhance the understanding of the tightness regulation of molecular knots.

An interesting odd-even effect of alkyl chain linkers on their tightness was demonstrated, which not only provides key insights into size-tightness relationships but also guides further development of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tightness engineering has evolved as an efficient strategy for the design of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials with desired properties and functions since tightness is a primary parameter that determines the property of a knotted strand. However, as an attractive topic that inspires mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists, whether the smallest knot is exactly the tightest one remains unaddressed experimentally. To tackle this challenge, a series of organic trefoil knots with the backbone-atom as short as 70 have been successfully synthesized by developing a new modular self-assembly approach in this study. To our great surprise, with the help of gradient tandem mass spectrometry, the quantitative tightness evaluation suggested that the molecular trefoil knot with a backbone crossing ratio (BCR) of 24.0 is even tighter than the one with a BCR of 23.3 (i.e., the smallest organic trefoil knot with the shortest ropelength synthesized so far), thus demonstrating an unexpected yet interesting odd-even effect to enhance the understanding of the tightness regulation of molecular knots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Neural Stem Cells with Micropatches for Improved Therapy of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing techniques and are adhered to the membrane of neural stem cells through tuning material&#8211;cell interaction. The micropatches on the membrane can move together with implanted neural stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid to promote the neuronal differentiation of stem cells and thus improve their therapeutic performance in repairing traumatic brain injury.








Abstract
Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) holds promise for repairing traumatic brain injury (TBI) but their therapeutic performance is hindered due to the low efficient differentiation into neurons. Direct injection of differentiation modulators to the lesion site has limited improvement to neuronal differentiation as they tend to diffuse or be degraded. In the present study, we report a simple and versatile strategy to engineer the NSCs with a micropatch to improve their therapeutic performance in TBI treatment. The micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing technique and can adhere to the membrane with negligible detachment or internalization within 14 days after surface modification. The micropatches on the cell membrane can move together with stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid, a neuronal differentiation modulator, to regulate the surrounding microenvironment of NSCs, improving their neuronal differentiation rate from 28.0% to 54.2%. The micropatch&#8208;engineered NSCs can be implanted into the injured brain tissue through a minimally invasive microinjection approach and show outperformance in repairing damaged neural tissue of TBI mice compared to normal stem cells. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway to engineer stem cells and holds great potential in nerve regeneration and neurodegenerative disease treatment.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis From CO2 and Nitrate via Porphyrin and Metalloporphyrin MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PMOF) and Cu&#8208;metallated PMOF for adaptive electrocatalytic urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;), addressing concentration&#8208;dependent challenges. PMOF facilitates&#160;*HNO2&#8208;*CO2 coupling under concentrated NO3&#8722;, while Cu&#8208;porphyrin MOF (Cu&#8208;PMOF) promotes&#160;*NO&#8208;*CO coupling in dilute conditions, with theoretical calculations and in situ studies revealing distinct C&#8208;N coupling pathways for sustainable urea production.








Abstract
Traditional urea synthesis via the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process suffers from high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Electrocatalytic urea production from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) under ambient conditions offers a sustainable alternative, yet challenges persist due to variable NO3&#8722; concentrations and competing side reactions. Herein, we propose porphyrin metal&#8208;organic framework (PMOF) and Cu&#8208;porphyrin MOF (Cu&#8208;PMOF) catalysts for NO3&#8722; concentration&#8208;adaptive urea synthesis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that PMOF weakly adsorbs *NO2 via hydrogen bonding, favoring its coupling with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF strongly binds *NO2 at Cu sites, facilitating spontaneous *NO/*CO coupling to form *OCNO intermediates under dilute NO3&#8722; conditions. Experimentally, PMOF achieves a urea yield of 28.6&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 23.1% in 0.1&#160;M NO3&#8722;, whereas Cu&#8208;PMOF outperforms in 0.05&#160;M NO3&#8722; with a yield of 25.5&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and FE of 52.7%. In situ spectroscopy and mechanistic study confirm distinct pathways: PMOF relies on stepwise coupling of *HNO2 with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF enables consecutive *NO&#8208;*CO coupling. This work highlights adaptive electrocatalyst design for efficient C&#8208;N coupling, advancing sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Scalable Hyperpolarized MRI Enabled by Ace&#8208;SABRE of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ace&#8208;SABRE overcomes previous biocompatibility challenges associated with the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) hyperpolarization technique. The employed acetone&#8211;water mixtures greatly simplify separation of the hyperpolarized compound (e.g., pyruvate) from solvents and catalysts delivering a biocompatible injectable. Ace&#8208;SABRE retains high polarization during processing and enables effective metabolic characterization&#160;in vivo.








Abstract
Hyperpolarized (HP) MRI using [1&#8211;13C]pyruvate is emerging as a promising molecular imaging approach. Among hyperpolarization methods, Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is attractive because SABRE polarizes the substrates directly in room&#8208;temperature solutions avoiding complex hardware. Most SABRE experiments have historically been performed in methanol, a relatively toxic and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;remove solvent. Here we demonstrate the use of a 80/20 acetone/water (A/W) solvent system (Ace&#8208;SABRE) to provide hyperpolarized [1&#8211;13C]pyruvate with up to 17% polarization, then implement a solvent processing protocol to achieve injectable solutions retaining 74% of the initial polarization, and lastly we demonstrate HP in vivo spectroscopy and imaging using the Ace&#8208;SABRE platform to showcase metabolic tracking in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor as well as HP&#8208;MRI, both in direct comparison to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) experiments. The Ace&#8208;SABRE technique promises faster adoption of SABRE hyperpolarization in biological experiments, overall lowering the barriers to entry for HP&#8208;NMR and HP&#8208;MRI.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Reconstruction of Cation&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched Ni@Ni2P Particles in Hollow N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers&#8208;encapsulated defective Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP particles are rationally synthesized for efficient catalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, where the in situ electrochemical reconstruction induces the formation of new active Ni(OH)2 species. 








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions is promising to promote the artificial nitrogen cycling. Despite the development of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts, their incident in situ electrochemical reconstruction always leads to the ambiguity of veritable active sites and reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report an approach to encapsulate Ni@Ni2P particles with cationic Ni vacancies in hollow N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (designated Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs) for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and have investigated their surface reconstruction and reaction mechanisms using various in situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations. Specially, the regulation of cationic Ni vacancy concentration in the three defective Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs catalysts leads to the 3.92&#8208;fold NH3 yield rate difference at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE. During the electrocatalytic reaction process, new amorphous Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH species form on the surface of Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs and the stable amorphous Ni(OH)2 species benefits the generation of more active hydrogen (*H) for hydrogenation with NO3&#8722;. This is further verified by the different reaction rate&#8208;determining steps on the pristine and reconstructed defective catalysts. Integration of the optimized defective catalyst as cathode into a stable aqueous Zn&#8211;NO3&#8211;battery provides high power density and Faraday efficiency for NH3.

&lt;/i&gt;P particles are rationally synthesized for efficient catalytic nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, where the in situ electrochemical reconstruction induces the formation of new active Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) under ambient conditions is promising to promote the artificial nitrogen cycling. Despite the development of transition metal-based catalysts, their incident in situ electrochemical reconstruction always leads to the ambiguity of veritable active sites and reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report an approach to encapsulate Ni@Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P particles with cationic Ni vacancies in hollow N-doped carbon nanofibers (designated Ni@Ni&lt;sub&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;P@N-CNFs) for electrocatalytic NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and have investigated their surface reconstruction and reaction mechanisms using various in situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations. Specially, the regulation of cationic Ni vacancy concentration in the three defective Ni@Ni&lt;sub&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;P@N-CNFs catalysts leads to the 3.92-fold NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate difference at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE. During the electrocatalytic reaction process, new amorphous Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiOOH species form on the surface of Ni@Ni&lt;sub&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;P@N-CNFs and the stable amorphous Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species benefits the generation of more active hydrogen (*H) for hydrogenation with NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is further verified by the different reaction rate-determining steps on the pristine and reconstructed defective catalysts. Integration of the optimized defective catalyst as cathode into a stable aqueous Zn&#8211;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;battery provides high power density and Faraday efficiency for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulate the Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gap by Spatially Separating HOMO and LUMO for High Performance Organic Photovoltaic Acceptors</title>

Designing the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor with both small &#8710;EST and high performance is challenging. To address this, YDF, YTF, and YTF&#8208;H were synthesized. YDF&#8208;based device achieved a high PCE of 20.04% via partial orbital separation. YTF's spatially separated HOMO and LUMO indeed lead to a much reduced &#8710;EST caused by decreasing S1 but also caused strong S1&#8208;S0 couplings. These results indicate the ideal scenario would be to elevate the T1 state, thereby mitigating the energy gap law.








Abstract
Reducing the single&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;EST) for organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules has been proposed to be able to reduce the nonradiative recombination by tuning the low&#8208;lying triplet state (T1) and/or the excited state (S1), thus reducing the energy loss (Eloss) and increasing the open&#8208;circuit voltage in their devices. However, how to design the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) with small &#8710;EST and high performance is challenging. Aiming to address this issue, YDF, YTF, and YTF&#8208;H were synthesized. Among them, a device based on YDF with partially spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) exhibits a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.04%, which is one of the most efficient efficiencies for binary systems. For YTF and YTF&#8208;H, their completely spatially separated HOMO and LUMO indeed lead to a much reduced &#8710;EST caused by the low&#8208;lying S1 state, together with excellent charge mobility and light absorption, required for higher performance OPV. But their low S1 state causes several non&#8208;radiative recombinations due to strong S1&#8208;S0 coupling (PCE&#160;&lt;&#160;1.5%). These results indicate that future designs to have high performance molecules with small &#8710;EST should avoid the sharp decrease in S1, and the ideal scenario would be to elevate the T1 state, thereby mitigating the energy gap law.

         <title>Design Strategy for Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes: Regulated Active Groups Enable High Capacity and Voltage in Aqueous and Seawater Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>

N&#8208;Heteroaromatic organic small&#8208;molecule (DPPZ&#8208;CN) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity. When DPPZ&#8208;CN is used as the cathode material in aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery demonstrates exceptional capacity, voltage plateau, and lifespan, even maintaining superior electrochemical performance in seawater, which highlights its potential for challenging environments.








Abstract
Organic materials demonstrate significant potential as electrodes for aqueous batteries, owing to their high theoretical capacity, structurally tunable frameworks, and sustainable material accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule organic electrode materials enable better active&#8208;site accessibility but remain challenged by the dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which deteriorates cycling stability, and poor conductivity due to limited conjugation. Here, we designed an organic small&#8208;molecule cathode material (DPPZ&#8208;CN) featuring functional pyridine, pyrazine, and cyano groups. Its highly conjugated fused N&#8208;heteroaromatic structure provides strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity, resulting in improved stability, capacity, and conductivity. The electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano group further modulates electron delocalization and molecular orbitals, enhancing electronic conductivity and operating voltage. Through combined theoretical and experimental studies, including operando synchrotron FT&#8208;IR, in situ Raman, ex situ XPS, and 1H NMR, we demonstrate that DPPZ&#8208;CN facilitates efficient dual&#8208;cation storage (Al3+/H+), thereby reducing Al3+ cation repulsion and induced structural distortion. As a result, the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery exhibits outstanding capacity, a well&#8208;defined voltage plateau, and an extended lifespan in organic aluminum batteries with aqueous and seawater electrolytes, highlighting its potential for operation in challenging environments.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Ratchet Mechanism Accelerates Regioselective Metal&#8208;Cation Exchange in a Heterobimetallic Helicate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates form with high diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity via single&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly or self&#8208;sorting. White&#8208;light exposure autonomously operates one helicate as a molecular ratchet, promoting the selective formation of an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium structure. This ratchet mechanism furthermore accelerates regioselective metal&#8208;cation exchange from a homometallic to a heterometallic helicate.








Abstract
Molecular machines rely on their capacity to exploit non&#8208;equilibrium processes to perform work. However, the development of these non&#8208;equilibrium processes, such as molecular ratchets, is still in its early stages. Here, we report a diazocine&#8208;containing ligand (L) harbouring two distinct chelating coordination sites that can self&#8208;sort into dinuclear homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates ([FeII2L](OTf)4, [CoII2L](OTf)4, [ZnII2L](OTf)4, [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4, [ZnIICoIIL](OTf)4) with precisely controlled metal cation distribution. The photoisomerisation of the helicates operates via a molecular ratchet mechanism, resulting in metastable diastereomers that shift the system from thermodynamic equilibrium. Continuous white&#8208;light irradiation autonomously drives this ratchet process, selectively enriching an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pseudo&#8208;mesocate structure. Crucially, the ratchet mechanism can significantly accelerate metal&#8208;cation exchange from the [ZnII2L](OTf)4 helicate to the [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4 helicate. Thus, the system operates in a manner reminiscent of a &#8220;claw machine&#8221;, selectively seizing FeII ions when subjected to a precisely controllable external stimulus. These findings lay the foundation for creating adaptive and reconfigurable supramolecular structures that use non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena on a molecular level.

         <title>Structural Differentiation of Homologous Anisodimensional Frameworks Driven by Site&#8208;Selective Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time a site&#8208;selective polymerization strategy enabling the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from identical building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. The modulator plays a dual regulatory role by enhancing the reaction reversibility and regulating the conformational flexibility of monomers, leading to the formation of 2D and 3D COFs with distinct photocatalytic performances.








Abstract
Theoretically, distinguished from the dimensional isomers in reticular chemistry, structures with different dimensions can also be formed by site&#8208;selective polymerization using identical building blocks bearing a high density of reactive sites. Unfortunately, the spatial confinement imposes significant challenges for molecular building blocks to achieve dimensional differentiation via their intrinsic site&#8208;selective reactivity. In this work, we first report the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) driven by site&#8208;selective polymerization of identical molecular building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. This unique phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time to originate from the role of aniline in enhancing the reversibility of the reaction system and modulating the conformational flexibility of the monomers. We systematically elucidated the mechanism underlying this dimensional differentiation and successfully demonstrated the generality of the synthetic strategy. Moreover, the residual benzaldehyde in the frameworks generated via the site&#8208;selective polymerization of the building blocks can serve as exciton acceptors, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work not only offers a novel strategy for regulating the dimensionality of COFs but also provides a valuable reference for precisely controlling the conformational flexibility of building blocks to enable topological transformations.

         <title>Local Electric Field Microenvironment&#8208;Induced Dynamic Spatial Confinement to Stabilize I+ Toward High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading and Stable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A local electric field (LEF) microenvironment is induced by the abundant polyquaternary ammonium cations in polydimethylammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I), which effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8722;) on the cathode.This design dynamically coordinates the dense ligand sites around I+, ensuring the stable conversion of I+ ion even under high iodine mass loading conditions.








Abstract
Four&#8208;electron iodine conversion chemistry (I&#8722;/I2/I+) endows zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with competitive energy density. The stability of I+ conversion relies on its interaction with sufficient nucleophilic species (e.g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). However, under high iodine loading, nucleophilic species fail to afford sufficient coordination strength and number within thick iodine cathode to stabilize I+, thus compromising the high&#8208;voltage plateau and capacity. Here, we effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8722;) on the cathode by &#9472;C&#9472;N+&#8208;induced localized electric field (LEF) microenvironment in polyquaternary ammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I). Spatial confinement maximizes Cl&#8722; concentration on the cathode ensuring highly reversible I0/I+ conversion, even in the low&#8208;concentrated ZnCl2 addition and high iodine loading. Importantly, the dynamically regulated Cl&#8722; maintains a balance with iodine species at the &#9472;C&#9472;N+ sites during cycling, effectively limiting the shuttling effect of polyiodides. Consequently, even adopting a high iodine loading of 16.03&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the PDDA&#8208;I still maintains a distinct four&#8208;electron&#8208;conversion dual voltage plateau with a remarkable capacity of 4.97 mAh cm&#8722;2. An impressive lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles is achieved at 12.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with a capacity decay of 0.0012% per cycle, exceeding conventional iodine cathodes by 20&#8208;fold. This work provides an important reference for high&#8208;performance four&#8208;electron conversion zinc&#8211;iodine batteries at high iodine loading.

         <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;Modification of Pyridine&#8208;Imine COFs for Enhanced Hydrolytic Stability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 35, August 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;condensation reaction of bifunctional monomers containing both amino and acetal groups yielded COF&#8208;LIFM7. Via subsequent amidation and N&#8208;oxidation modifications, the pore polarity and hydrophilicity of the post&#8208;modified COFs were progressively enhanced, consequently leading to a significant increase in proton conductivity. 








Abstract
Emerging as a type of promising material for proton conduction, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) assembled from dynamic imine bonds face a challenge of surmounting hydrolytic instability to achieve long&#8208;term performance in humid environments. In this work, we report a post&#8208;synthetic strategy to simultaneously enhance the hydrolytic stability and hydrophilicity of a pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;LIFM7, without compromising its crystallinity and porosity. A bifunctional monomer containing amino and acetal groups was employed to construct the primary framework, which was subsequently modified via amide formation and pyridine N&#8208;oxidation to yield COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide and COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide&#8208;N+O&#8722;. These stepwise modifications increased the polarity and hydrogen&#8208;binding sites within COF pores to improve water affinity, leading to a three&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in the proton conductivity for COF&#8208;LIFM7&#8208;Amide&#8208;N+O&#8722;, reaching 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 95% relative humidity and 70&#160;&#176;C. This study highlights a generalizable post&#8208;synthetic approach for tuning the pore chemistry of COFs to achieve high performance in proton&#8208;conducting applications under humid conditions.

         <dc:description>
Strong and tough single network hydrogels are reported using a dual orthogonal 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine crosslinker, which both acts as a covalent crosslinker and as a dynamic crosslinker upon metal complexation with zinc(II) ions.








Abstract
Developing simple and efficient methods to mechanically reinforce single&#8208;network hydrogels for practical applications remains an important challenge. This study presents a strategy for preparing poly(2&#8208;isopropenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PiPOx) hydrogels using a dicarboxylic acid functionalized terpyridine (TPy) dual orthogonal crosslinker that acts as both a permanent covalent crosslinker and a dynamic non&#8208;covalent crosslinker upon metal complexation. In this dual orthogonal crosslinking approach, PiPOx is first crosslinked with the dicarboxylic acid functionalized TPy in DMSO to form a stable covalent network, followed by solvent exchange to water, drying and&#160;the introduction of reversible coordination bonds through swelling in an aqueous zinc(II) ion solution. This orthogonal dual crosslinking strategy results in high compressive strength (26.6&#160;MPa) and tough (5.28&#160;MJ&#183;m&#8722;3) single&#8208;network hydrogels. This is attributed to the fact that the hydrogel combines thermodynamically stable primary permanent crosslinks and dynamic secondary reversible crosslinks in the same dual crosslinker, leading to polymer network contraction, thereby providing a novel and simple approach for the preparation of strong and tough dual orthogonal crosslinked single network hydrogels.

Based on the superior thermodynamic miscibility between Bi and Sn, a nano&#8208;sized Janus Bi&#8211;Sn catalyst with rich interfaces was constructed via a novel in situ electroreduction strategy. The unique atomic patterns achieve the maximum exposure of active sites with optimized electronic structure and significantly boost the electrocatalytic performance for formate production.








Abstract
Interfaces in heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts play a pivotal role in providing rich active sites and accelerating charge transfer during reaction process. However, designing an interface&#8208;rich catalyst with sufficient exposed active sites is crucial yet challenging. Janus catalysts containing bifunctional surfaces segregated by interfaces can boost the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction by optimizing electronic structure and reaction pathway. Herein, we construct a nano&#8208;sized Janus Bi&#8211;Sn catalyst by in situ electroreduction method, and the optimized structure and composition endow Bi&#8211;Sn catalyst with high FEHCOO&#8208; of 95.5% (&#8722;0.9&#160;V) and remarkable structural stability (310&#160;h) in H&#8208;type cell. The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation validates that the good thermodynamic miscibility between Bi and Sn favors the decrease of atomic segregation rate during ambient electroreduction process facilitating the formation of interfaces. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that Bi&#8211;Sn interface pattern demonstrates moderate electronic interaction facilitating the decrease of adsorption free energy of HCOO* by optimizing the p&#8208;orbital energy level of Sn. Moreover, Janus Cu&#8211;Sn and Cu&#8211;Co catalysts were fabricated via in situ electroreduction strategy verifying the universality of the proposed method. This work provides new sights into engineering nonprecious Janus structured catalysts based on in situ electroreduction strategy.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture and Functionalization from a Molecular Ti(III) Oxo Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their communication, Mindiola and coworkers demonstrate how a reduced Ti complex can reversibly bind CO2 to produce organic and inorganic carbonates. They access this chemistry through a unique TiIII oxo anion that can be generated both chemically and electrochemically. The subtle electronic and structure parameters of this species promote its reactivity and establish an exciting route to the capture, functionalization, and release of CO2.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide capture and functionalization sequesters carbon dioxide in more robust products and offers a viable route to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We present herein a unique molecular TiIII&#160;oxo anion that reversibly binds CO2 to allow both its sequestration and functionalization. The reduction of [(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (1) [PN = (2&#8208;PiiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)(mesityl)amide] with KC8 and 2.2.2&#8208;cryptand (crypt) resulted in formation of [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (2), which was fully characterized and shown to contain a Ti&#8208;centered radical. Complex 2 reacts with Al(CH3)3 to form [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti{O(Al(CH3)3}] (3), which can be independently prepared from [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(OCP)] and Al(CH3)3. Whereas 1 does not react with CO2, 2 rapidly captures the gas (1 atm, 25&#160;&#176;C) to produce a TiIII carbonate [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(&#954;2&#8208;O2C&#9552;O)] (4). Chemical and electrochemical oxidation of 4 releases CO2 to regenerate 1 while a soluble organic carbonate [Me3SiOC(O)OSiMe3, Me = CH3]&#160;is obtained from reaction of 4 with ClSiMe3.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Metal Alloy Nanotubes with Sub&#8208;1 Nm Wall Thickness for Efficient Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;metal alloy nanotubes with sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm wall thickness are synthesized via a simple one&#8208;pot method, which exhibits efficient mass transfer and nearly 100% surface exposure. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity enabled by the multi&#8208;metal alloying effects, the CuNiCoFeRu alloy nanotube shows excellent performance in nitrate reduction and nitrobenzene reduction.








Abstract
The multi&#8208;metal alloy (MMA) catalysts display exceptional multifunctional catalytic capabilities. However, it is still a great challenge to improve the catalytic performance by accurately synthesizing the morphology. Herein, we present a simple one&#8208;pot method for designing and synthesizing the ultrathin MMA nanotube&#8208;structured CuNiCoFeRu catalysts (CuNiCoFeRu UNT), which achieve unprecedented comprehensive performance in nitrate and nitrobenzene reduction. The MMA nanotube with sub&#8208;1&#160;nm wall thickness showed efficient mass transfer and nearly 100% surface exposure. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity enabled by the multi&#8208;metal alloying effects, the CuNiCoFeRu UNT achieved as high as 98% NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) and 6.8&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. yield in the nitrate reduction, and as high as 99% selectivity with a yield of 16.4&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. from nitrobenzene to aniline. High electron density and the synergistic effect among elements endow CuNiCoFeRu UNT with considerably enhanced nitrate and nitrobenzene reduction activity. This finding provides a highly efficient electrocatalyst for inorganic and organic nitrogen reduction. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy can be applied to other multi&#8208;metal alloy nanotubes with ultrathin walls, including binary, ternary, quaternary, quinary and senary alloy structures, demonstrating that the synthetic route is a general and universal method for multi&#8208;metal alloy nanotubes.

Abstract
Photochromic smart windows with efficient solar heat and sunlight modulation are highly sought after for energy efficiency in buildings.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Polystyrene Into Benzene for Recycling and Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical degradation of polystyrene into benzene through ball milling is demonstrated for the first time. The benzene generated can be used to synthesize the styrene monomer for a closed&#8208;loop recycling or be converted into benzophenone through a mechanochemical cascade Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation for upcycling.








Abstract
Synthetic plastics sourced from petroleum have gained widespread use since the 1950s. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most extensively used plastics, as it is colorless, has high mechanical strength, and exhibits excellent chemical and thermal stability; however, it is also one of the least recycled plastics because of the high cost and low profit in recycling. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanochemical recycling approach that allows PS to be efficiently degraded into benzene when it is ground in a ball mill with AlCl3. For example, when 165&#160;kDa PS pellets are milled with AlCl3, the extent of degradation reaches 90% at 15&#160;min.

     alt="Mechanochemical Degradation of Polystyrene Into Benzene for Recycling and Upcycling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemical degradation of polystyrene into benzene through ball milling is demonstrated for the first time. The benzene generated can be used to synthesize the styrene monomer for a closed-loop recycling or be converted into benzophenone through a mechanochemical cascade Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation for upcycling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic plastics sourced from petroleum have gained widespread use since the 1950s. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most extensively used plastics, as it is colorless, has high mechanical strength, and exhibits excellent chemical and thermal stability; however, it is also one of the least recycled plastics because of the high cost and low profit in recycling. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanochemical recycling approach that allows PS to be efficiently degraded into benzene when it is ground in a ball mill with AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, when 165&#160;kDa PS pellets are milled with AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the extent of degradation reaches 90% at 15&#160;min. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that both ambient water and the polymer backbone can be proton sources for the formation of benzene. The benzene generated in the mechanochemical degradation can be used to synthesize styrene, which can be repolymerized to produce polystyrene, allowing for the closed-loop recycling of PS. In addition, a mechanochemical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation between the generated benzene and the subsequently added benzoic anhydride produces benzophenone in 40%&#8211;50% yield. The mechanochemical degradation process demonstrated here is solvent-free, cost-effective, and energy-efficient, providing a promising route for the chemical recycling and upcycling of PS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amino Nests Boost Pd/SiO2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Selective Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd single atoms anchored within the amino nest on the SiO2&#8208;NH2 support (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2) were successfully fabricated and exhibited robust catalytic performance in selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene with an amazing specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that amino nests can selectively capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step over the Pd single atoms.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is a critical industrial process for purifying ethylene feedstocks. Palladium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Pd SACs) exhibit exceptional ethylene selectivity in this hydrogenation reaction. However, their isolated active sites show limited ability to capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, resulting in relatively low hydrogenation activity. To overcome this limitation, we designed Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst on the SiO2 surface modified with amino nests (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2). In this architecture, Pd single atoms are embedded within amino nests on the surface of SiO2&#8208;NH2 support. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amino nests selectively capture and adsorb acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step. The Pd&#9472;N bonds formed between the amino nest and the Pd atom promote hydrogen activation. At 190 &#176;C, the Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2 catalyst achieves complete acetylene conversion with the ethylene selectivity of 92%. Remarkably, it delivers a specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, surpassing all previously reported SACs. This work establishes an amino nest&#8208;assisted design paradigm for single&#8208;atom catalysts, enabling efficient, selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Control in Copper(I) Iodides via Inorganic Structural Engineering Within a Single&#8208;Cation Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission tunability was achieved in hybrid copper(I) halides through systematic engineering of the inorganic framework within a single&#8208;cation host system. Mechanism investigation revealed the evolution of the self&#8208;trapping exciton emission mechanism, which is closely related to the inorganic Cu&#8211;I coordination configuration. This work provides insights into the rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.








Abstract
Hybrid copper(I) halides have emerged as a new class of optoelectronic materials due to their tunable structure and photophysical properties. However, systematically correlating inorganic polyhedra configurations with emission characteristics remains challenging. Herein, we address this by synthesizing a homologous series of copper(I) iodides templated solely by the [C13H24N]+ cation. Precise control reaction conditions yielded distinct inorganic polyhedral configurations, monomeric [CuI3]2&#8722; (1), dimeric [Cu2I4]2&#8722; (2), trimeric [Cu3I6]3&#8722; (3), and tetrameric [Cu4I6]2&#8722; (4). We establish a direct correlation where increasing inorganic aggregation systematically reduces the bandgap and dictates the luminescence color across a near&#8208;full visible spectrum, from blue (1) to cyan (2), red (3), and yellow (4). Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal the self&#8208;trapped excitons emission mechanism dependent on the Cu&#8208;I configuration, in which the closed [Cu4I6]2&#8722; configuration is more resistant to excited lattice deformation, thereby resulting in a lowest Stokes shift energy. Furthermore, stimuli&#8208;responsive sequential phase transitions between these well&#8208;defined structures were demonstrated, offering insights into their structural dynamics. This work provides critical fundamental understanding of how inorganic framework engineering within a fixed organic host precisely controls both electronic structure and excited&#8208;state relaxation pathways in hybrid copper(I) halides, paving the way for rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.

         <title>Optical Force Monitoring in Polymeric Materials with a Coumarin&#8208;Based Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin dyes are reacted with acrylates to form a mechanophore via an accessible two&#8208;step synthesis that exhibits exclusive responsivity to force. Mechanical deformation of polymeric materials functionalized with the mechanophore activates blue fluorescence visible to the naked eye, enabling the optical detection of force&#8208;induced molecular damage in the material.








Abstract
Optical mechanophores offer a powerful platform for the real&#8208;time, nondestructive detection of mechanically induced damage in polymers. However, the exploitation of mechanophores for fundamental investigations of deformation processes and the prediction of failure in technologically critical applications has been constrained by their responsivity to other stimuli, laborious synthesis, and limited control of their photophysical and mechanical properties. Here, we report a cyclobutane&#8208;based mechanophore that activates a fluorescent coumarin dye through the application of mechanical stress in solution and in the solid state. We demonstrate the preparation of the mechanophore in two synthetic steps, its incorporation into linear and crosslinked polymers, and its thermal and photochemical stability, establishing the basis for a new class of mechanophores with tunable spectral and mechanical characteristics.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Switching Controlled Luminescence in Hybrid Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, controllable coupling of ferroelectric polarization and luminescence behavior has been achieved in a hybrid halide luminescent ferroelectric with multi&#8208;state emission under electric field.








Abstract
Luminescent ferroelectrics have sparked significant attention in integrated photoelectronic devices, optical sensing and storage. Their potential cross&#8208;coupling effect of polarization&#8208;light modulation would offer enormous possibilities for novel functionalities and multi&#8208;level information processing. However, achieving controllable coupling modulation between photoluminescence (PL) and ferroelectric polarization has always been a long&#8208;standing challenge since the first discovery of ferroelectricity in 1921. Moreover, the ferroelectrics equipped with tenably multi&#8208;state emission in a single material has been a blank to date. Herein, we reported the first successful integration and coupling of ferroelectricity and luminescent behavior in a single&#8208;component hybrid material, (Quinuclidinium&#8208;3&#8208;one)2ZrCl5. Remarkably, based on the controllable orientation of dipole ions, its PL intensity can be deliberately modulated by polarization switching under the action of external electric field, achieving a coupling&#8208;induced PL intensity variation ratio as high as 50%, which is unprecedented among reported hybrid ferroelectrics. More interestingly, (Quinuclidinium&#8208;3&#8208;one)2ZrCl5 also exhibits multi&#8208;state emission with PL colors from apricot red to emerald green through varied light&#8208;excitation. This work represents a major breakthrough in luminescent ferroelectrics and would herald the emergence of novel application potential toward smart photoelectronics.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Polyester Waste Upcycling via Lattice Oxygen Redox Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrated lattice oxygen activity, represented by the amounts of O 2p ligand holes and O 2p band center relative to the Fermi level, as the electronic descriptor for the performance of spinel oxides MCo2O4 (M&#9552;Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR).








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upcycling of waste polyester plastics into valuable organic acids offers a dual solution for mitigating plastic pollution and promoting sustainable carbon cycling. However, practical implementation remains limited by the scarcity of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, we investigate MCo2O4 (where M&#9552;Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) as model catalysts and identify lattice oxygen activity as a critical factor governing the electrochemical upgrading of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET). NiCo2O4 demonstrates the highest oxygen activity, characterized by the greatest density of O 2p ligand holes and the closest proximity of the O 2p band center to the Fermi level. Such unique character facilitates lattice oxygen participation in surface electro&#8208;oxidation reactions, leading to exceptional performance of up to 98.3% formate selectivity and 98.9% Faraday efficiency, among the highest values reported for transition metal catalysts in alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation. We further demonstrate the direct electrocatalytic upcycling of real waste PET plastics, estimating a $739 profit per ton of recycled PET and confirming its economic viability. These results provide critical insights for refining the design principles of electrocatalytic systems aimed at recycling diverse waste materials and pollutants.

         <title>Unexpected Spontaneous Generation of Superoxide Radicals: Water&#8208;Solid Collision as an Atypical Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can be generated at the water&#8208;solid collision interface even in the dark, which come from the reduction of dissolved oxygen in water by electrons transferred by the water&#8208;solid contact. Simulations of rain colliding with mineral interface further confirm this phenomenon. Quantitative studies show that the production of O2&#8226;&#8722; in this process is equivalent to that in photochemical reactions. 








Abstract
Spontaneous generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) driven by water&#8208;solid contact electrification was a new source of redox chemistry. However, superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;), a kind of ROS that was of great significance in both natural and engineering environments, remain overlooked and poorly understood at the water&#8208;solid interface. Here, we found O2&#8226;&#8722; could be generated spontaneously when water collided with the solid interface even under dark conditions, and its production was quantified by CL. 18O isotope labelling experiments and solid&#8211;liquid contact electrification detection confirmed that the generation of O2&#8226;&#8722; was from the reduction of dissolved oxygen by electrons at the water&#8208;solid interface and that the kinetic energy of the water energized the reaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of solid&#8211;liquid collisions, such as rain colliding with mineral surfaces during rainfall, we further systematically investigated the O2&#8226;&#8722; generation and their decay kinetics at three distinct rain&#8208;mineral interfaces. Results showed that O2&#8226;&#8722; generation ranged from 0.015 to 1.1&#160;nM, comparable to the O2&#8226;&#8722; production by photochemical pathways. Our findings established the water&#8208;solid collision interface as a previously unrecognized global source of O2&#8226;&#8722; and highlight a universal yet overlooked physicochemical mechanism underpinning multiphase redox chemistry.

         <title>Construction of Fused&#8211;Bridged Tricycles by Molecular Reorganization Involving Prins Cyclization/Dicycloexpansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade Prins cyclization/dicycloexpansion of cycloalkylidene&#8208;tethered cycloketones (or their dimethoxy ketal form) was developed to synthesize fused&#8208;bridged tricyclic ring systems with consecutive quaternary centers through a molecular reorganization strategy. A diverse library of fused&#8208;bridged tricyclo[M.L.N] scaffolds (M/L/N&#160;=&#160;5&#8211;7) was accessible through systematic variation of substituents, ring sizes, tether lengths, and connectivity patterns.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods for constructing structurally complex and diverse polycyclic carbon frameworks remains in high demand for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. One such method lies in engineered one&#8208;step molecular reorganization through the cascade cyclization/cycloexpansion of rationally designed precursors with interconnected small&#8208;ring systems. Here, we have strategically designed and developed a synthetically valuable method to construct fused&#8208;bridged tricyclic systems through cascade Prins cyclization/dicycloexpansion of substrates with a cycloalkylidene (CAD) tethered to a cycloketones. This methodology features high step economy, reaction efficiency, and selectivity, as well as a broad substrate tolerance. Diversification through variation of the size of the small ring, the linker length, and the linking site has enabled the efficient synthesis of six types of fused&#8208;bridged tricyclic scaffolds, which are found frequently in bioactive natural products. Based on supporting experiments and DFT calculations, a plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed.

         <title>A Fluorogenic Hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) ligation reaction is used to label lipid&#8208;derived aldehydes under wash&#8208;free conditions in live cells. This innovative technique enables wash&#8208;free imaging within biological systems, offering invaluable insights into the extent and localization of oxidative stress.








Abstract
Lipid peroxidation generates diverse aldehydic lipids associated with oxidative stress and signaling, yet methodologies capable of their detection in live cells are currently lacking. Here, we report a fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) probe for lipidic aldehydes &#8220;FLipA&#8208;HIPS&#8221; that generates bright, wash&#8208;free fluorescent reaction products in vitro and in cellulo. FLipA&#8208;HIPS is essentially nonfluorescent but reacts with aldehydes to give an environmentally sensitive fluorophore with a higher quantum yield in SDS micelles as compared to aqueous buffer alone. FLipA&#8208;HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10&#8208; to 25&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short&#8208;chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that&#160;live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid &#8220;POVPC&#8221; display rapid and selective FLipA&#8208;HIPS staining that co&#8208;localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes. These results demonstrate that HIPS reactions can exhibit useful fluorogenic properties for aldehyde biosensing applications in live cells.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanocrystals with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;IIb Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) via controllable cation intermixing (Ca2+, Ln3+), the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) between the host lattice and the lanthanide emitters can be regulated. This enables tunable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) lifetime, which is beneficial for time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.








Abstract
Lattice engineering in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) is fundamental for tailoring their versatile optical properties, yet it remains underexplored in manipulating the downconversion characteristics. Here, we engineer the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in LnNCs by CaF2 deposition on vacancy&#8208;controlled &#946;&#8208;NaxGdF3+x:Yb,A (A = Tm/Er, x = 0.5, 0.75, 1) NCs. We demonstrate that strain&#8208;graded lattices with high phonon energy enhance the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) in the downconversion process more effectively than distorted lattices, which helps to extend the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb, 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm) lifetime of Er3+/Tm3+ by 2&#8764;4 times. Subsequent epitaxial CaF2 growth further attenuates surface phonon coupling, enabling exponential tunability of NIR&#8208;IIb lifetime (Tm3+: 0.74&#8764;6.28&#160;ms; Er3+: 0.055&#8764;9.2&#160;ms). Finally, we showcase the potential of these LnNCs in time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.

&lt;p&gt;Engineering the lattices from distorted to strain-graded in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) via controllable cation intermixing (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), the multi-phonon orbit-lattice relaxation (MPR) between the host lattice and the lanthanide emitters can be regulated. This enables tunable near-infrared-IIb (NIR-IIb) lifetime, which is beneficial for time-resolved multiplexed bioimaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lattice engineering in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) is fundamental for tailoring their versatile optical properties, yet it remains underexplored in manipulating the downconversion characteristics. Here, we engineer the lattices from distorted to strain-graded in LnNCs by CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; deposition on vacancy-controlled &#946;-Na&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;GdF&lt;sub&gt;3+x&lt;/sub&gt;:Yb,A (A = Tm/Er, x = 0.5, 0.75, 1) NCs. We demonstrate that strain-graded lattices with high phonon energy enhance the multi-phonon orbit-lattice relaxation (MPR) in the downconversion process more effectively than distorted lattices, which helps to extend the near-infrared-IIb (NIR-IIb, 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm) lifetime of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Tm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; by 2&#8764;4 times. Subsequent epitaxial CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; growth further attenuates surface phonon coupling, enabling exponential tunability of NIR-IIb lifetime (Tm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.74&#8764;6.28&#160;ms; Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.055&#8764;9.2&#160;ms). Finally, we showcase the potential of these LnNCs in time-resolved multiplexed bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter Through Steric Presubstitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE Over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple resonance greenish emitter with extended skeleton is tailor&#8208;designed using a bulk tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups presubstituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as bridge, not only suppressing the intermolecular aggregation&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions to maintain a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 22&#160;nm in device but also achieving a high external quantum efficiency of 41.0% with small efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric presubstitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8211;Friedel&#8211;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter, therefore, achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22&#160;nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21&#160;nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5&#160;lm W&#8722;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. This work establishes a presubstitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Platform for Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Customization of Multivalent Artificial Antibodies and Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular self&#8208;assembling platform ATPlug has been developed that integrates three critical domains: a self&#8208;trimerizing Tri module for enhanced binding avidity, a SpyCatcher domain that enables rapid conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain that improves circulation half&#8208;life and tissue selectivity. This platform allows rapid customization of multivalent artificial antibodies and modular ADCs with enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, offering a versatile toolkit for drug development.








Abstract
Modular assembly of multivalent therapeutics with precise modulation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties remains a critical challenge in drug development. Here, we present ATPlug, a self&#8208;assembling protein platform that integrates three crucial functional modules: a trimerization domain to enhance avidity, a SpyCatcher module for efficient conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain to optimize pharmacokinetics and tissue selectivity. This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30&#8208;fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half&#8208;life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug&#8208;customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8&#160;nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR&#8208;overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy. This plug&#8208;and&#8208;play strategy provides a framework for next&#8208;generation therapeutics combining customized multivalency with multidrug synergies.

         <title>Molecular Afterglow of Lophine&#8208;Based Luminophore and Its Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered that lophine&#8212;the first historically documented chemiluminescent compound&#8212;can be converted from weak chemiluminescence to bright molecular afterglow by caging its imidazole moiety. This switch greatly enhances its emission intensity, enabling, for the first time, the use of lophine derivatives for in vivo imaging applications, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and monitoring adipose tissue changes induced by the GLP&#8208;1 agonist Semaglutide






.

Abstract
Lophine, the first chemiluminescent compound discovered in history, has rarely been applied for in vivo imaging since its discovery in 1877. In this report, we demonstrate that lophine's chemiluminescence emission could be significantly enhanced by caging the imidazole moiety via molecular afterglow mechanism. Notably, our study revealed a rare superoxide anion&#8208;mediated luminescence. Our novel probes JIMI&#8208;11 and JIMI&#8208;12 could be used for in vivo mouse imaging. Compared to its uncaged form JIMI&#8208;6, JIMI&#8208;11 exhibited a significant enhancement (126&#8208;fold) in vitro and a 190&#8208;fold higher emission signal in vivo. JIMI&#8208;11 selectively accumulates in white adipose tissues (WAT) and can be used to monitor changes in WAT mass in a mouse model of type&#8208;1 diabetes. Additionally, it can assess the therapeutic effects of Semaglutide in a mouse model of diet&#8208;induced obesity. Lastly, we designed JIMI&#8208;12 with a reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) responsive moiety as the caging group and demonstrated its utility for in vivo imaging of ROS in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory mouse model. Our studies suggest that re&#8208;designing lophine&#8208;based probes could unlock their potential for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The ability to switch from chemiluminescence to molecular afterglow introduces a novel approach to designing imaging probes.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Hybrid of Viruses and Supramolecular Peptide Fibers for Multidimensional Control of Patterning and Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid of a bacteriophage virus and a helical supramolecular fiber, composed of an amphiphilic peptide containing an azobenzene group (A2Az), as a virus hybridizable self&#8208;assembling peptide is reported. The hybrid undergoes disassembly by photo&#8208;induced depolymerization of the A2Az fiber, which enables site&#8208;selective control of the adhesion and infection behaviors of the bacteriophage not only on 2D substrates but also in 3D hydrogel environments.








Abstract
Viruses are versatile colloidal materials in their biofunctions, monodispersed and periodic structures, and high surface designability. For expanding the applicability of virus&#8208;based materials, spatiotemporally controlled immobilization and dispersion of viruses with retained activity should be useful, though control of the dynamic nature of viruses hybridized with commonly used polymers has been difficult due to their strong interactions. Here, we report a self&#8208;assembling peptide (A2Az) enabling photo control of adhesion and dispersion of M13 bacteriophage virus (M13 phage) and successfully demonstrate patterning of localization and infection of the virus. A2Az is a cationic peptide with amphiphilicity that consists of eight amino acid residues containing a photo&#8208;responsive azobenzene group at the second position and self&#8208;assembles into a helical supramolecular fiber to form a hydrogel. The helical fibrillar morphology of A2Az exhibits strong interaction with M13 phage, allowing for immobilization not only on a two&#8208;dimensional surface but also in a three&#8208;dimensional hydrogel with suppression of infectivity. The A2Az fiber undergoes a light&#8208;triggered fiber&#8208;to&#8208;particle transition and releases the immobilized M13 phage with retained infectivity for the photo&#8208;controlled patterning of localization and infection. This approach has potential applicability to various virus&#8208;based biomaterials, such as structural materials and materials for photo&#8208;selective gene transfection to cells.

The A2Az fiber undergoes a light-triggered fiber-to-particle transition and releases the immobilized M13 phage with retained infectivity for the photo-controlled patterning of localization and infection. This approach has potential applicability to various virus-based biomaterials, such as structural materials and materials for photo-selective gene transfection to cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exciton Regulation and Fluorescence Switching via Redox&#8208;Responsive Heterojunction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by traditional Chinese lanterns, this work constructs a covalent triazine framework (CTF) that spatially organizes CdSe quantum dots (QDs) into spherical structures. The CTF serves as a nanoscale &#8220;lantern shell&#8221; enabling interfacial charge transfer and excitonic regulation. The resulting CdSe@CTF material achieves selective and visual detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) via dual&#8208;mode fluorescence&#8211;colorimetric response.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;responsive fluorescence regulation at heterointerfaces remains a critically underdeveloped yet strategically significant domain in advanced chemical sensing. Herein, we present an exciton modulation strategy enabled by heterojunction engineering between electron&#8208;rich CdSe quantum dots and an electron&#8208;deficient covalent triazine framework (CTF). This type&#8208;I CdSe@CTF heterostructure achieves nanoscale electronic decoupling and directional charge redistribution, unveiling a previously unreported fluorescence&#8208;switching mechanism governed by redox&#8208;triggered interfacial reconfiguration. Beyond excitonic regulation, the heterostructure intrinsically mimics oxidase&#8208;like catalysis, enabling dual fluorescence&#8211;colorimetric readouts within a unified excitonic framework. When embedded into flexible electrospun membranes and combined with artificial neural network (ANN)&#8208;based image recognition, the system offers adaptive and intelligent detection under bio&#8208;relevant conditions. This study establishes a molecularly encoded design paradigm that bridges exciton dynamics, redox chemistry, and wearable photonic sensing, offering a blueprint for the development of multifunctional bioelectronic platforms.

         <title>Bidirectional Hydrogen Spillover Enables High Activity Catalysts for Rechargeable Hydrogen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst with low ruthenium loading accelerates the reaction kinetics of HER/HOR in acidic environments via the bidirectional hydrogen spillover mechanism, thereby enabling hydrogen batteries to exhibit excellent activity and stability across a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Rechargeable hydrogen batteries exhibit superior electrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in acidic media compared to alkaline counterparts, making them promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the development of efficient electrocatalysts for both HER and HOR in acidic media remains challenging, as conventional platinum&#8208;based catalysts face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving high activity and long&#8208;term stability under harsh operating conditions. Herein, we introduce a bidirectional hydrogen spillover strategy to enable synergistic bifunctional HER/HOR catalysts for hydrogen batteries. We demonstrate a Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru&#8211;WO3@CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO3 enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru&#8211;WO3@CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H2SO4), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm&#8722;2 at 50 mV &#8212; both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru&#8211;WO3@CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures. This work aims to explore the feasibility of bidirectional hydrogen spillover in enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities toward HER/HOR, providing new insights for high&#8208;performance hydrogen batteries.

         <title>Volcano&#8208;Shaped Relationship Between Interfacial K+&#8208;H2O Ratio and CO2 Reduction Activity in Tandem Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The M4/Ni1NC catalysts featuring single Ni atoms and M4 atomic clusters can dynamically modulate *H supply and ECRR performance through regulating interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio. A volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio near the electrode and ECRR performance. Cu4/Ni1NC with a moderate interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio achieves a high FECO of &gt;95% across a 0.8&#160;V potential range, delivering industrially relevant current density of 385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. 








Abstract
Modulating surface&#8208;active hydrogen (*H) supply represents a critical strategy to boost the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR), yet the mechanistic interplay between *H dynamics and catalytic behavior remains ambiguous. Herein, we construct tandem catalysts (M4/Ni1NC, M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Cu, or Mn) by coupling tetranuclear metal clusters (M4) with single&#8208;atom Ni sites on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1NC) to regulate *H supply. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the *H supply is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetic factors. The M4 clusters provide the thermodynamic feasibility for *H supply for CO2 activation. The *H supply rate in kinetic perspective is tuned by the K+&#8208;H2O ratio of interfacial water, determined by work function of the decorated M4 clusters. The increased K+&#8208;H2O ratio can promote water dissociation to maintain optimal *H coverage for intermediate hydrogenation, whereas excessive *H accumulation triggers competitive hydrogen evolution. Therefore, a volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio and ECRR performance. Among these samples, Cu4/Ni1NC with moderate *H supply rate in kinetic exhibits exceptional ECRR performance, achieving &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency for CO across a 0.8&#160;V potential range (&#8722;0.2 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE) and industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&#8764;385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#160;V) in a flow cell.

         <title>Engineering Gradient D&#8208;d Orbital Occupancy to Boost Substrate Adsorption for Efficient Electrocatalytic Biomass Valorization</title>

         <dc:description>
The construction of Mn&#8208;O&#8208;Ni channels enables precise regulation of orbital occupancy at Ni active sites, optimizing their electronic states and achieving highly efficient HMF electrooxidation to FDCA.








Abstract
Electrocatalysis provides a green and sustainable approach for the upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to the polymer monomer 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Precisely tuning the electronic structure, specifically the electron gradient orbitals and spin state of key active sites, is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance, as it directly influences the adsorption strength of the reactive substrate. Herein, by introducing Mn4+/3+ with low 3d filling, the e&#8722;&#8211;e&#8722; repulsion between bridging O2&#8722; and Ni2+ is weakened due to &#960;&#8208;donation function. Corresponding energy level splitting and partial occupancy of the spin&#8208;up state orbital determine the location and state density of the Fermi level. Based on this, an ultra&#8208;high current density of 1.2&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at the potential of only 1.42&#160;V versus RHE can be achieved with a well&#8208;designed Mn&#8208;modified porous metallic skeleton Ni for HMF electrooxidation. Furthermore, continuous flow electrolysis experiments confirmed the stable FDCA production capacity, yielding 88.3% FDCA after approximately 300&#160;h of operation. This insight into the electron gradient orbitals&#8211;activity relationship can provide valuable guidance for developing electrocatalysts for biomass upgrading.

         <title>Engineering Energy Dissipation Pathway via Topological Design: Toward Tunable Macroscopic Mechanical Performances of Dynamic Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leverage orthogonal host&#8211;guest recognition and metal&#8208;ligand coordination to construct SPNs and MINs with distinct topological cross&#8208;linked architectures, which perform&#160;divergent energy dissipation pathways. In SPNs, after host&#8211;guest recognition dissociates, the macrocycle slides along the axle and slips off, with the coordination bond remaining intact. In contrast, in MINs, force transmission from the host to the axial stoppers following host&#8211;guest dissociation, results in rupture of metal&#8208;coordination bonds and contributes to additional energy dissipation. This fundamental difference in energy dissipation pathways results in significantly enhanced mechanical performance of MIN&#8208;2. 








Abstract
The incorporation of multiple supramolecular interactions as sacrificial bonds for energy dissipation has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of elastomeric materials. However, precise control over energy dissipation pathways remains challenging, primarily due to the difficulty in selectively activating specific interactions on demand. Herein, we present an orthogonal self&#8208;assembly strategy that integrates host&#8211;guest recognition and metal&#8208;coordination to tailor energy dissipation mechanisms. We demonstrate that subtle modifications at the axial terminals of host&#8211;guest motifs dictate the formation of supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) or mechanically interlocked networks (MINs), respectively. Upon external force, SPNs dissipate energy primarily through host&#8210;guest dissociation, while coordination bonds remain intact. In contrast, in MINs, force transmission from the host to the axial stoppers following host&#8210;guest dissociation leads to the rupture of metal&#8208;coordination bonds, enabling additional dissipate energy. This fundamental divergence in energy dissipation pathways results in superior mechanical performance in MIN&#8208;2, with higher strength (19.1&#160;versus 14.5&#160;MPa), toughness (57.7&#160;versus 45.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), and puncture resistance compared to SPN&#8208;2. These findings highlight the potential of topological structure design in precisely tuning energy dissipation pathways, offering a robust and versatile strategy for developing high&#8208;performance supramolecular elastomers.

         <title>Boosting Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion over Copper&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts by Facilitating Hydrogenation and Product Desorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O with oxalate modification is synthesized as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction. By integrating the facilitated NO3&#8722; adsorption and hydrogenation, promoted NH3 desorption and impeded side reactions, an excellent performance is achieved with an NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 97.49% in neutral condition.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a sustainable route for ammonia (NH3) production and water purification. For the most extensively investigated Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts that favor NO3&#8722; adsorption, insufficient hydrogenation capability and sluggish NH3 desorption hinder the ultimate performance. Herein, we report Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O co&#8208;modified by oxalate (Ca&#9472;Cu2O&#9472;OA) as a novel and high&#8208;performance NitRR electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the Ca dopant with strong hydration effect facilitates the hydrogenation steps of adsorbed NO3&#8722; on the adjacent Cu active sites. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between OA and adsorbed NH3 promotes the product desorption. Together with the strong NO3&#8722; adsorption capability and inhibited hydrogen evolution as a side reaction, excellent NitRR performance with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.49% and a high NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is achieved in neutral condition, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced NitRR electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Developing distinctive composite anodes with multiple active components is critical for enhancing the charge storage capability of sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs). Herein, In single atom&#8208;substituted SnS2 with moderate sulfur vacancies in situ bonded on N&#8208;doped graphene nanotubes (In&#9472;SnS2&#8722;x@NG) is ingeniously engineered as a superior anode. Theoretical calculations and in situ/ex situ characterizations illustrate that the introduced Sn(In)&#9472;N interfacial bonds immensely strengthen composites integration and boost charge transfer, then In single atom substitution effectively elevates d band center and enhances Na+ adsorption. Moreover, the sulfur vacancies reveal the bifunctional roles in accelerating Na+ diffusion and reinforcing structural thermodynamics. These merits guarantee deeply reversible conversion&#8208;alloying reaction and yield additional surface capacitive behavior of the In&#9472;SnS2&#8722;x@NG anode, further realizing &#8220;1+1+1&gt;3&#8221; synergistic enhanced sodium storage with ultrahigh reversible capacity (&#8764;1211.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and prominent rate performance of 417&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a SIHC device with the In&#9472;SnS2&#8722;x@NG anode and the activated carbon cathode exhibits the high energy/power density of 278&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1/10.0&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1 and long cycle lifespan, showing promising practical application. This work not only offers in&#8208;depth insights for designing SIHCs anodes, but also paves the way on practical applications for Na+ storage systems.

         <title>Electron Delocalization&#8208;Driven Dual&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry in NiCo&#8208;LDH for High&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The introduction of cobalt into the Ni(OH)2 lattice facilitates the generation of charge&#8208;transfer orbitals through delocalized electrons near the Fermi level. In addition, the ultrathin structure reduces the second&#8208;step dehydrogenation energy barriers through weakened interlayer hydrogen bonding, thereby enabling efficient dual&#8208;electron transfer. This work contributes new insights into metal&#8208;doping optimized electron storage mechanism.








Abstract
As a cathode material for alkaline Zn batteries, Ni(OH)2 shows limited capacity and efficiency due to its single&#8208;electron transfer per redox site and the side reaction of oxygen evolution during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Here, we report an electrode material featuring an ultrathin NiCo&#8208;LDH layer coated on hollow carbon shell (NC@HCS). Incorporating Co into the lattice affects the conformation and band structure of adjacent Ni sites via CoO6 octahedral distortion, leading to the formation of charge&#8208;transfer orbitals through electron delocalization near the Fermi level, which significantly reduces the oxidation potential of Ni(OH)2. The ultrathin NC@HCS architecture weakens interlayer hydrogen bonding during the dehydrogenation process (charging), lowering the dehydrogenation energy barrier. This structural feature facilitates the formation of high&#8208;valence states and enables efficient two&#8208;electron transfer. As an efficient cathode material for Zn batteries, the ultrathin NC@HCS cathode exhibits a remarkable capacity of 528&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 (0.63&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2). This strategy provides a pathway for developing high&#8208;performance and durable cathode materials for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Solvent&#8208;Assisted Cation Exchange Approach to Hollow Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanoreactors with Orderly Distributed Active Sites for Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional hollow MOF nanoreactor, Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which contains precisely encapsulated Pd nanoparticles inside cavities, was controllably synthesized through one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange method. Micro&#8208;mesoporous shell thicknesses in the range of 22&#8211;73&#160;nm are controlled by easily tuning Pd2+ loading. The resulting Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 has the ability of size&#8208;selective molecular recognition and tandem catalysis.








Abstract
Biological membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles, in which cascade reactions promoted by multiple enzymes occur, have inspired widespread interest in the design of spatially confined nanoreactors for tandem catalytic transformations. Because of their accessible compartmentalized environments and large framework diversity, hollow metal&#8211;organic frameworks (H&#8208;MOFs) are ideal platforms for the development of new multi&#8208;functionalized nanoreactors. However, simple methodologies for fabrication of hollow MOFs, which possess functionalities that are precisely localized and encapsulated of active sites like those found in biological membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles, is a considerable challenge. Herein, a facile, one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange method was firstly developed for controlled synthesis of multifunctional H&#8208;MOF, Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which contains precisely encapsulated Pd nanoparticles (NPs) inside cavities. Micro&#8208;mesoporous shell thicknesses in the range of 22&#8211;73&#160;nm are effectively controlled by easily tuning Pd2+ loading. Impressively, the delicate nanoarchitecture and precise encapsulation of Pd NPs give Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 a propensity for size&#8208;selective molecular recognition in catalytic hydrogenation reactions and ability to catalyze tandem processes. Observations made in this effort suggest that one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange protocol might serve as general avenue for the design and construction of multi&#8208;functionalized H&#8208;MOFs, which can be employed in diverse applications in the fields of material chemistry.

         <title>Stable Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Domains for Selective Gas Adsorption</title>

The ultramicroporous pores of TUB41 selectively host water and CO2 molecules at distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments without competition. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the thermal and chemical stability, and the gas adsorption behavior, of a mixed&#8208;linker phosphonate MOF, [Cu(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(1,4&#8208;NDPAH2)], namely TUB41 (where bpy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine and NDPAH4&#160;=&#160;naphthalenediphosphonic acid). TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1&#8211;11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80&#160;&#176;C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO2 and H2O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO2 at a loading 0.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 and H2O at a loading of 0.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 are &#8722;41 and &#8722;38&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H2O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean&#8208;squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO2 reduction under challenging conditions.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI, Electrophoresis&#8208;Correlative Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with AI&#8208;Based Data Processing Broadens Access to Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affordable single&#8208;cell proteomics workflow combines capillary electrophoresis, real&#8208;time ion sorting, and AI&#8208;aided spectral deconvolution to profile early Xenopus embryonic cells. Despite using a legacy Orbitrap, this strategy matches or exceeds the sensitivity of modern instruments, uncovering proteome dynamics at sub&#8208;nanogram scale.








Abstract
Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry (MS) offers unprecedented sensitivity for profiling cellular proteomes, yet widespread adoption is hindered by the cost of advanced instrumentation. Here, we broaden access to single&#8208;cell proteomics by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE), data&#8208;dependent acquisition (DDA) with electrophoresis&#8208;correlative (Eco) ion sorting, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted spectral deconvolution via CHIMERYS (Eco&#8211;AI). This &#8220;Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI&#8221; workflow was implemented on a custom&#8208;built CE platform coupled to a legacy hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus). Despite slower scan speed, lower resolution, and inferior ion transmission efficiency, real&#8208;time Eco&#8208;DDA sampling and CHIMERYS processing enabled identification of up to &#8764;15 peptides per spectrum&#8212;performance on par with modern Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid systems. From 1&#160;ng of HeLa digest, 2142 proteins were identified, surpassing the 969 proteins detected on a contemporary nanoLC Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Even from &#8764;250 pg (a single&#8208;cell equivalent), 1799 proteins were identified in &lt;15&#160;min of effective separation, raising a theoretical throughput of 48 samples per day. As proof of principle, Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI profiled 1524 proteins from single precursor cells (50&#8211;75&#160;&#181;m diameter) in Xenopus laevis blastulae, revealing proteome asymmetry during neural versus epidermal fate specification. These results establish Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI as a budget&#8208;conscious yet powerful strategy for single&#8208;cell proteomics using CE&#8211;MS.

         <title>A Modular Three&#8208;Component Asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction Enabled by Cooperative Palladium/Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reaction was realized by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid catalysis for the straightforward construction of enantioenriched diversely functionalized allylic compounds from organic feedstocks of aldehydes, allylboronates, and nucleophiles. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. Finally, the protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reactions, named as the Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction, stand as a landmark in modern organic synthesis. The merge of AAS reactions with the concept of multicomponent modular synthesis could allow flexible customization of molecular architectures from fundamental feedstocks, which remains underdeveloped. Herein, we disclose our recent observations on a novel three&#8208;component asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction enabled by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid (LA) catalysis. This &#8216;1C&#160;+&#160;2C&#160;+&#160;NuH&#8217; approach starts from fundamental organic feedstocks, i.e., aldehyde, allylboronate, and a nucleophile with the in situ formation of a C&#9552;C double bond. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component AAS reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. The protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids. Mechanistic studies suggest that the three&#8208;component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA&#8208;catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.

A mild, modular approach is described for the stereocontrolled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acid esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acids&#8212;characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter&#8212;represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical&#8208;radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, &#946;&#8208;keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox&#8208;active NHPI esters derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids are reduced via SET to form &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross&#8208;coupling to afford &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Maxwell Protocol for Non&#8208;Destructive Health Diagnosis of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diagnostic protocol&#8212;based on the Maxwell relations&#8212;that combines entropymetry and volumetry is proposed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Entropymetry mirrors the delithiation heterogeneity in cathode materials, whereas volumetry reflects the internal porosity in the electrode. This quantitative diagnostic approach allows used cells to be classified as reusable, or requiring reconditioning or recycling for a sustainable battery ecosystem.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) exhibit distinct degradation dynamics characterized by intricate interfacial cascade reactions that differ markedly from those of conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Despite being technologically promising, these systems currently lack robust health diagnostic frameworks to capture their critical failure mechanisms. Various physicochemical analyses based on cell disassembly are available and provide useful health&#8208;related information; but, because of their destructive nature, they render cells unusable for continuous health monitoring over long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, we present a nondestructive diagnostic methodology founded on the Maxwell relations. This approach enables the precise detection of the delithiation heterogeneity in cathode active materials and quantifies internal void formation by measuring changes in the open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) in response to temperature and pressure variations, respectively, without perturbing the cell operation. Our comprehensive thermodynamics analysis protocol establishes systematic criteria for classifying cells into one of three categories: reuse, recondition, or recycle. This nondestructive diagnostic methodology enables the sustainable utilization of ASSB technology based on efficient resource management.

         <title>Photochemical and Redox&#8208;Controlled ON&#8211;OFF Switching in Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ON/OFF switching of PCET. Light and redox&#8208;induced PCET ON&#8211;OFF switching was investigated in a series of ruthenium complexes. Photosubstitution triggers the conformational from a nonaqua to a PCET&#8208;active aqua complex, while oxidation induces a reverse conformational change.








Abstract
We report a reversible ON&#8211;OFF proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) switch based on ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, triggered by both light and redox stimuli. Upon photoirradiation, a carboxylate&#8208;ligated Ru(II) complex undergoes photosubstitution to generate a metastable, PCET&#8208;active aqua complex. This metastable complex exhibits redox&#8208;induced conformational change, regenerating the original carboxylate complex. The switching behavior enables external control of PCET activity, directly modulating electrocatalytic water oxidation. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses reveal that the mechanism is governed by a pH&#8208;dependent interplay between intramolecular conformational change and bimolecular electron exchange. Importantly, the rate&#8208;determining step shifts from unimolecular conformational change near neutral pH to bimolecular electron exchange under acidic conditions. These findings establish a strategy for designing tunable molecular switches and redox&#8208;responsive functional materials.

         <title>In Situ Click Chemistry Screen Facilitated by an On&#8208;Nanoparticle DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Identifies Highly Selective and Potent Peptoid Ligands for a Phosphatase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ligands that selectively target closely related protein families or isoforms remains a critical challenge. A protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy, enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL), yielded nanomolar, highly selective inhibitors of PTP1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site.








Abstract
Capture agents that selectively bind to biological targets are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biomedical research. However, discovering such capture agents, particularly for structurally conserved or challenging targets, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL) platform. The nanoDEL enables the construction and screening of vastly large, chemically diverse combinatorial libraries with high redundancy, far exceeding the scale and throughput of conventional approaches, such as one&#8208;bead&#8208;one&#8208;compound and solution&#8208;phase in situ click methods. Thus, this enables the rapid and efficient identification of high&#8208;affinity, high&#8208;selectivity ligands in a single selection round, eliminating the need for iterative screening. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we performed an in situ click screening of a 27&#8208;million&#8208;member nanoDEL of azido&#8208;functionalized peptoids, in the presence of a weak and promiscuous alkyne&#8208;bearing anchor ligand. This yielded bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site. These inhibitors exhibited nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity over closely related phosphatases. This work represents a broadly applicable strategy for discovering high&#8208;performance capture agents, particularly for selectively targeting closely related protein families or isoforms where achieving selectivity remains a critical challenge.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalyst/Initiator for Precise Synthesis of Polycarbonates and Copolymers with Unprecedented Activity and Molecular Weights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate highly efficient synthesis of polycarbonates via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, and their gradient or block copolymers with lactide in one&#8208;pot reactions, using the single&#8208;component catalyst/initiator comprising a thiourea moiety and alkoxide.








Abstract
The development of efficient and selective catalytic methods for synthesizing well&#8208;defined polycarbonates and their copolymers represents a significant advancement toward sustainable polymer production. In this study, we report a series of innovative single&#8208;molecule hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts/initiators for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, enabling rapid and precise synthesis of polycarbonates and their copolymers with polylactide. These catalysts uniquely facilitate simultaneous activation of both monomer and chain&#8208;end within a single molecular architecture, demonstrating superior activity compared to conventional multicomponent hydrogen&#8208;bonding initiating systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that alkyl substitution plays a critical role in enhancing catalytic activity for ROP by reducing the energy barrier relative to aryl&#8208;substituted analogues. The modular design of these catalysts allows for facile structural optimization and performance tuning. Notably, Cat. 1 exhibits high catalytic efficiency at 25&#160;&#176;C, producing polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and high molecular weights (Mn up to 164.8&#160;kDa, &#208; of 1.37). We further demonstrate versatile copolymerization strategies: one&#8208;step copolymerization yields gradient polycarbonate&#8208;g&#8208;polylactide copolymers, whereas sequential monomer addition in one&#8208;pot reactions produces well&#8208;defined block polycarbonate&#8208;b&#8208;polylactide copolymers within minutes.

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate highly efficient synthesis of polycarbonates via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, and their gradient or block copolymers with lactide in one-pot reactions, using the single-component catalyst/initiator comprising a thiourea moiety and alkoxide.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient and selective catalytic methods for synthesizing well-defined polycarbonates and their copolymers represents a significant advancement toward sustainable polymer production. In this study, we report a series of innovative single-molecule hydrogen-bonding catalysts/initiators for the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, enabling rapid and precise synthesis of polycarbonates and their copolymers with polylactide. These catalysts uniquely facilitate simultaneous activation of both monomer and chain-end within a single molecular architecture, demonstrating superior activity compared to conventional multicomponent hydrogen-bonding initiating systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that alkyl substitution plays a critical role in enhancing catalytic activity for ROP by reducing the energy barrier relative to aryl-substituted analogues. The modular design of these catalysts allows for facile structural optimization and performance tuning. Notably, &lt;b&gt;Cat. 1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits high catalytic efficiency at 25&#160;&#176;C, producing polycarbonates with well-defined structures and high molecular weights (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; up to 164.8&#160;kDa, &lt;i&gt;&#208;&lt;/i&gt; of 1.37). We further demonstrate versatile copolymerization strategies: one-step copolymerization yields gradient polycarbonate-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-polylactide copolymers, whereas sequential monomer addition in one-pot reactions produces well-defined block polycarbonate-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-polylactide copolymers within minutes. These block copolymers exhibit high molecular weights (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; up to 189.4&#160;kDa, &lt;i&gt;&#208;&lt;/i&gt; of 1.37), precisely tunable thermal properties, and exceptional mechanical performance, highlighting their potential for advanced material applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Glycomimetics by Photocatalytic One&#8208;Pot C(sp3)&#9472;H Acylation and Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;acyl glycosides and carbasugars from readily accessible and bench&#8208;stable 1&#8208;deoxyglycosides was developed by photo&#8208;HAT/nickel dual catalysis. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits high stereoselectivity across diverse glycosyl units. The approach was further applied to the synthesis of a challenging cyclopentanepentol, an analogue of calditol.








Abstract
Glycomimetics, structural mimics of natural carbohydrates such as C&#8208;glycosides and carbasugars, are important therapeutic leads for treating a variety of diseases. However, the structural and stereochemical complexity of glycomimetics poses daunting challenges to synthetic chemists and is incompatible with diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approaches. Herein, we develop a facile and general method for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;acyl glycosides and carbasugars from readily accessible and stable 1&#8208;deoxyglycosides via photo&#8208;HAT/nickel dual catalysis. The reaction proceeds in one&#8208;pot under mild conditions and exhibits high stereoselectivity across a wide range of glycosyl units, illustrating the potential of this method in the preparation of structurally diverse and densely functionalized carbasugars. The synthetic utility of this strategy is further demonstrated in the synthesis of challenging cyclopentanepentol, an analogue of calditol.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Modulation of Mg2+ Desolvation Beyond the Primary Solvation Shell in Magnesium Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the outer solvation sheath, the CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between 7&#8208;aminoindole (7AID) and solvent molecules counteract the coordination bonds between Mg2+ and solvent molecules. Meanwhile, in the bulk phase, 7AID reduces the availability of solvent molecules for Mg2+ coordination via hydrogen bonds and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. The interactions in dual sites reduce the Mg2+&#8208;desolvation energy barrier, thereby reducing the overpotential.








Abstract
High overpotential and instability of Mg anode reactions limit the development of halide&#8208;free Mg battery electrolytes. Here, we report 7&#8208;aminoindole (7AID), a predominantly noncoordinating additive that modulates solvation via CH&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with both Mg2+&#8208;bound and free ether solvents. These outer&#8208;shell and bulk&#8208;phase interactions weaken Mg2+&#183;&#183;&#183;solvent binding, enhance solvent mobility, and lower the desolvation barrier. As a result, Mg plating/stripping overpotentials are significantly reduced and interfacial stability is improved. Compared to strongly coordinating additives, this approach suppresses parasitic reactions and enables more stable cycling. This work presents a solvation&#8208;targeted additive design paradigm beyond the primary coordination shell for advancing multivalent battery electrolytes.

         <title>Regulating the Nanosheets Structures in Pitch&#8208;Derived Amorphous Carbons for Efficient Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a molecular engineering strategy, the nanosheets structure of the pitch&#8208;derived amorphous carbon (PDAC) anode material has been precisely regulated. The results demonstrate that extending the disordered amorphous carbon nanosheets and preventing intersheet spacing contraction not only increases sodium ion storage capacity but also enhances diffusion kinetics, significantly improving the rate capability of the amorphous carbon anode material.








Abstract
Amorphous carbon (AC), prized for their cost&#8208;effectiveness and excellent performance, are promising as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, its amorphous structure challenges balancing high rate capability with high capacity. This study regulates the nanosheets structure of pitch&#8208;derived&#8208;AC (PDAC) through pre&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons growth, enabling simultaneous enhancement of rate capability and maintenance of high capacity. The regulation of the nanosheets length to 12.27&#160;nm can increase the closed pore volume to 0.062&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, thereby facilitating the formation of quasi&#8208;metallic sodium clusters, which elevates the specific capacity of PDAC to 377.4&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 in an ester&#8208;based&#8208;electrolyte, with the plateau region contributing up to 68.0%. Furthermore, the extended nanosheets maintain a spacing of 0.396&#160;nm, overcoming the kinetics limitations inherent in accessing plateau capacity at high current. Consequently, a specific capacity of 357.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (incl. 248.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 plateau capacity) is achieved at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1, with retention of 253.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Additionally, the PDAC demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 90.4% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. The critical roles of extending nanosheets, maintaining interlayer spacing, and increasing closed pore volume in enabling efficient Na&#8314; storage and advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs are systematically elucidated.

         <title>Optimizing Electronic Structure to Achieve High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel P3&#8208;K0.7Fe0.3Ni0.15Mg0.03Ti0.02Mn0.5O2 (KFNMTMO) cathode is crafted for high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion batteries. By doping with low&#8208;valent ions, the oxidation state of Mn is elevated to avoid charge compensation, thereby suppressing the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. Concurrently, the low electronegativity of Mg2&#8314; enhances the bonding interactions between transition metals and oxygen, improving the stability of lattice structure. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits high reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Layered Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes demonstrate great potential for application in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. However, issues such as Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of Mn and significant volume changes during K+ intercalation/removal severely limit their practical use. To address these challenges, we successfully synthesize the cathode material K0.7Fe0.3Ni0.15Mg0.03Ti0.02Mn0.5O2 (KFNMTMO) by introducing low&#8208;valence ions and incorporating active metal elements. The results show that the introduction of low&#8208;valence ions raises the average oxidation state of Mn to approximately +4, causing the projected density of states of Mn to shift above the Fermi level. This effectively suppresses the redox activity of Mn, making it primarily responsible for stabilizing layered structure. Meanwhile, electronic structure optimization considerably activates the redox couples of other active elements such as Ni2+/Ni3+ and Fe3+/Fe4+. This synergistic effect not only alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion but also, through the addition of the less electronegative Mg2+ ions, markedly enhances the orbital hybridization between transition metals and oxygen atoms, further improving the stability of crystal lattice. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving a reversible capacity of 114.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1, an energy density of 328&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.5% after 800 cycles.

Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving a reversible capacity of 114.3 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an energy density of 328&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.5% after 800 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated Base Assists Proton Stripping off Pt for Alkaline H2 Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present that, when proton acid is immobilized on carbon support, in alkaline solution, it will be deprotonated, forming numerous conjugated base surrounding Pt. Such surface anchored conjugated base will assist the stripping and interfacial transfer of H+ off Pt, thereby significantly enhancing alkaline HOR.








Abstract
Recent studies have revealed that slow transfer of the continuously formed H+ away from Pt surface can be a potential cause responsible for the extremely sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation (HOR). Herein, we show that anchoring mild oxyacid on carbon support is a generally effective approach to boost interfacial transfer of proton away from Pt. In alkaline solution, the surface anchored oxyacid is deprotonated generating affluent conjugated base surrounding Pt; taking C&#8208;PO42&#8208; as a typical example, the conjugated base can readily seize&#160;the as&#8208;formed H+ around Pt (Pt&#8208;H+ + C&#9472;PO42&#8208; &#8594; Pt&#160;+&#160;C&#9472;H2PO4) from HOR, which then are neutralized immediately by OH&#8722; in the bulk solution (C&#9472;H2PO4&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722; &#8594; C&#9472;PO42&#8722; + H2O). Via such repetitive protonation and deprotonation, the as&#8208;formed H+ from HOR is efficiently transported away from Pt surface, thereby significantly improving the HOR rates. This strategy is found both effective for developing home&#8208;made Pt electrocatalysts as well as for modification of those commercial Pt/C. This study emphasizes the importance of enhancing interfacial proton transfer along the pursuit of efficient Pt electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR and provides a straightforward and generally effective strategy to address the issue.

         <title>Hydrophilic Iridium Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes Catalyze Linear&#8208;Selective, Additive&#8208;Free Hydroaminomethylation of Long&#8208;Chain Olefins in Water</title>

         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;free hydroaminomethylation of long&#8208;chain olefins in water is achieved by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;iridium catalyst without high&#8208;pressure H2 and organic solvent, affording linear amines with good yields and high linear/branch selectivities. This approach provides a simple, straightforward, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective method for the synthesis of higher (deuterium) amines and derivatives.








Abstract
Aqueous hydroaminomethylation (HAM) of olefins generally requires the use of organic solvents, additives, and high&#8208;pressure hydrogen to synthesize amines in satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we accomplish the HAM reactions of long&#8208;chain olefins in water without organic solvent or additives by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ir complex as the catalyst. A broad scope of long&#8208;chain olefins and amines is well compatible, affording corresponding higher amines in up to 99% yields with excellent linear/branched (l/b) selectivity (up to 94/6). Mechanistic investigations reveal that water acts as both solvent and hydrogen source. The protocol can be readily extended to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and deuterated analogues with excellent yields and deuterium rates. Moreover, the amine products are easily separated by extraction, and the recovered aqueous phase could be directly used and recycled. This protocol offers a sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective approach for synthesizing higher amines.

         <title>Dual Co Sites in n&#9472;n Type Heterojunction Enable Selective Electrochemical Co&#8208;Valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual Co sites and built&#8208;in electric field in CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C were used for selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C n&#9472;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12&#160;V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#9472;to&#9472;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#160;h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#9472;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#9472;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation. This work establishes a blueprint for developing multi&#8208;functional catalytic architectures that address the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in coupled electrochemical systems, advancing the frontier of sustainable electrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Cyclochlorotine Hydroxylase CctR Reveals DUF3328 as a Family of Copper&#8208;Dependent Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DUF3328 is an enigmatic enzyme family implicated in diverse transformations in fungal natural product biosynthesis, yet its functions remain largely underexplored. Through biochemical characterization of the cyclochlorotine hydroxylase CctR, we define DUF3328 as a family of copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes. This study reveals key structural and mechanistic features shared across the family.








Abstract
DUF3328 is a protein family widely found in fungal natural product biosynthesis pathways. Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C(sp3)&#9472;H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane&#8208;associated copper&#8208;dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four&#8208;helix coiled coil, and C&#8208;terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x)nHxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen&#8208;dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.

         <title>Light&#8208;Gated Amine Exchange in Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating aniline&#8208;type diarylethenes as core&#8208;enriched crosslinkers in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) based microgels enables photomodulation of their responsivity towards temperature and pH as well as covalent binding and release of functional amines via light&#8208;gated amine exchange reaction. This study highlights the potential of photoswitchable microgels for smart biomedical materials.








Abstract
The functionalization of microgels with photoswitchable moieties enables the construction of multi&#8208;responsive systems, which are highly interesting for biological applications, for example, in drug delivery. Controlling the reversible uptake of functional molecules, however, remains a major challenge. To address this, we developed a novel aniline&#8208;type diarylethene (DAE) crosslinker and prepared a series of corresponding poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam)&#8208;based microgels with varying degrees of DAE crosslinker. Upon UV light irradiation, the aniline (and thus enamine) motif of the DAE is converted to its imine form, thus allowing for reversible exchange with primary amines. Irradiating the DAE with blue light covalently locks the equilibrium and traps the amine in the microgels. The light&#8208;controlled covalent binding of fluorinated, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic amine derivatives was proven by dynamic light scattering and 19F NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, the impact of photoisomerization and amine binding on microgel properties was investigated and we were able to remotely control size as well as temperature and pH responsiveness by light. Overall, this study demonstrates optically gated uptake and release of functional amines in multi&#8208;responsive microgels and highlights their potential biological applications.

         <title>Molecular Junction Polyoxotungstate&#8208;based Copper&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular junction polyoxotungstate&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic frameworks (i.e., Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;1, Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;2, and Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared and characterized that can be utilized in efficient photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes. The achieved reaction system enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis and operation under natural sunlight and air conditions. 








Abstract
The cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes is a vital catalysis step in the manufacture of C&#9472;C bonds. The traditional thermal catalysis, utilizing noble metal salts or toxic solvents, generally results in relatively low atom economy or unmet sustainable development prospect. The challenge of the CDC reactions lies in the simultaneous activation of C&#9472;H bonds in terminal alkynes and formation of free radical activation of tertiary amines to achieve the C&#9472;C coupling, which calls for novel catalytic techniques and powerful catalysts. For the first time, in exclusively green solvent (i.e., dimethyl carbonate), full light, and air, we have developed a series of molecular junction polyoxotungstate&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic frameworks (i.e., Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;1, Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;2, and Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3), each with unique topological dimension and well&#8208;regulated charge transfer ability that can be utilized in efficient photocatalytic CDC reactions. Notably, the optimal Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3 with the combination of polyoxotungstate and Cu sites within the 3D POMOF topological structure enables the simultaneous activation and C&#9472;C coupling of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes with 98% yield. In addition, the reaction system enables scale&#8208;up production (2.06&#160;g in a batch experiment) and operation under natural sunlight and air.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Azepines: A Cascade Strategy Featuring 1&#8208;Aza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breakthrough methodology has been developed for constructing chiral azepines through a relay catalysis system combining tetrapeptide bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salts (PBPSs) with a gold(I) catalyst. This strategy enables the first enantioselective, chiral intermediate&#8208;participated 1&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement. The key to this success lies in the rational design of a novel class of tetrapeptide&#8208;based bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salt (PBPS) catalysts, which exhibit significantly improved enantioselectivity and reaction efficiency compared to previous dipeptide&#8208;based phosphonium salt (PPS) systems.








Abstract
The 1&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement serves as a valuable method for constructing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds; however, its asymmetric variants remain largely underexplored due to unfavorable thermodynamics and reaction reversibility. To overcome these challenges, we developed a relay catalysis system comprising tetrapeptide bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salts (PBPSs) in combination with a gold(I) catalyst. This strategy incorporates a ring&#8208;opening process during the rearrangement to preserve stereocenters and facilitate product formation. Using this approach, we synthesized a variety of chiral azepines in excellent yields (up to 96%) and with high stereoselectivities (up to 98%&#160;ee and&gt;20:1&#160;dr). Mechanistic investigations clarified the origin of chirality and offered insights into the reaction pathway. This work presents a new strategy for constructing medium&#8208;sized chiral nitrogen heterocycles and highlights the broader potential of relay catalysis integrating transition metals with bioinspired peptide&#8211;phosphonium salts (PPSs).

         <title>Tailoring the Oxygen Vacancy Distribution in Se&#8208;Doped RuOx to Enhance Its Stability in Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of oxygen vacancy (VO) distribution on Ru oxide stability is unclear. We propose a strategy to tailor the distribution of VOs (VOs located away from Se dopants) via urea&#8208;assisted synthesis of Se&#8208;doped RuOx (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx), which optimizes the oxygen evolution mechanism pathway and inhibits Ru dissolution. Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx shows enhanced acidic water oxidation activity and stability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), surpassing the Se&#8208;RuOx with VO adjacent to Se.








Abstract
Developing durable ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) remains challenging due to irreversible Ru dissolution and lattice oxygen instability. Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (VOs), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of VO distribution on the stability of Ru&#8208;based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx) with the presence of urea, showing the VOs distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se&#8208;RuOx), showing VOs distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se&#8208;RuOx. Particularly, Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx delivers a low working voltage (1.62&#160;V@1&#160;A cm&#8722;2) and excellent durability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that VOs engage in long&#8208;range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx, synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in promising Ru&#8208;based catalysts.

A series of sulfate&#8208;pillared metal azolate frameworks (MAFs) were synthesized via a multivariate (MTV) strategy to systematically tune framework flexibility and gas separation performance. The monotonic sulfate&#8208;pillared MAF, Zn2(daTz)2SO4 (where daTz = 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate), exhibits pronounced structural dynamics upon adaptive guest inclusions, driven by triazolate linker rotation and reversible Zn&#9472;O bonds rearrangement, enabling dynamic pore modulation for efficient CO2, C2H4, and C2H6 uptakes. Incorporation of an asymmetric, non&#8208;amino linker effectively suppresses framework flexibility by reducing intraframework hydrogen bonding, resulting in a locked structure with enhanced selectivity for CO2 over light hydrocarbons. Gas adsorption and breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the MTV approach enabled structural control, leading to exceptional CO2/C2H6 and CO2/C2H4 separation performance. Notably, Zn2(mTz)0.74(daTz)1.26SO4 (where mTz = 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate) achieves 17&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene purification. Comprehensive structural analyses and interaction energy calculations reveal the molecular basis of flexibility regulation, offering valuable insights for designing next&#8208;generation porous materials for selective gas separation.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Azaarene Migration to &#945;&#8208;Azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Enabled by a Tailored Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective catalytic benzilic ester rearrangement of vicinal dicarbonyl compounds is reported, providing a variety of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good yields and high enantiopurities. This transformation features an asymmetric 1,2&#8208;azaarene shift, which is systematically investigated here for the first time. A newly designed chiral BOX ligand with extended and rigid side arms was critical for achieving effective stereocontrol.








Abstract
Despite their prevalence in bioactive molecules, the stereoselective construction of &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates remains a formidable challenge. Notably, although the benzilic ester rearrangement (BER) is an efficient approach to &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates, asymmetric catalytic BER remains poorly developed, largely due to poor stereorecognition of the vicinal diketone substituents by common chiral catalysts. In response to these issues, here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene&#8208;derived 1,2&#8208;diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five&#8208;membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2&#8208;nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2&#8208;azaarene migrations.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Programmed Sequential Fluorescence Encoding (VPSFE) Enables Multiplexed In Situ Proteo&#8208;Imaging with Electric&#8208;Field Turing Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Voltage&#8208;Programmed Sequential Fluorescence Encoding (VPSFE) pioneers electric&#8208;field Turing pattern for multiplexed in situ proteo&#8208;imaging, enabling 27&#8208;plex detection via single hybridization and voltage&#8208;controlled probe activation and removal (&#8764;4 minute per round) &#8212; eliminating iterative washing and achieving &#181;M&#8208;level probe tolerance.








Abstract
DNA barcode&#8208;based immunolabeling has revolutionized single&#8208;cell protein profiling. However, conventional multiplexed imaging methods are hindered by laborious probe exchange procedures involving buffer washing&#8208;based probe removal and prolonged hybridization cycles (requiring tens of minutes to 1.5&#160;h per cycle), which limit throughput, specificity, and universality. Here, we introduce an electrophoresis&#8208;based in situ probe removal method that achieves high&#8208;specificity iterative probe imaging without washing steps, utilizing 2&#8208;min low&#8208;voltage electrophoresis for excess probes removal and 3&#8208;min high&#8208;voltage electrophoresis for hybridized probes dissociation. The robustness was validated through 19 rounds of cyclic electrophoresis, 10 rounds of repetitive imaging, and simultaneous processing of 14 probes (&#181;M&#8208;level) across five rounds of multiprobe exchange, demonstrating exceptional specificity and efficiency. Applied to sequential color coding&#8208;based multiplexed imaging, this approach establishes voltage&#8208;programmed sequential fluorescence encoding (VPSFE), enabling multiplexed imaging of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT)&#8208;related proteins. Furthermore, we developed a VPSFE&#8208;based Turing pattern coding strategy for multiplexed detection that requires only a single multicolor probe hybridization step. Using three voltage conditions and three fluorescence channels, this system generates 27 unique fluorescence Turing patterns to encode 27 distinct targets. This electric&#8208;field Turing pattern coding strategy represents a novel probe exchange&#8208;free approach for rapid, universal, and highly specific multiplexed in situ imaging.

         <title>General Synthesis of 2D Mesoporous Multimetal Spinel Supracrystals for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general and modular strategy for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with well&#8208;defined mesoporous surfaces and compositions that range from unary to multinary oxides. Leveraging multimetal electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D geometry, mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are demonstrated as interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, which deliver exceptional electrochemical performance under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous metal oxide crystals that integrate atomic&#8208;level single crystallinity with ordered mesoporosity represent a promising but rarely realized class of materials, particularly in multicomponent systems. Here, we report a universal strategy for synthesizing freestanding 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with tunable compositions, spanning from unary to multinary spinel oxide systems. This approach decouples crystalline framework formation from mesopore generation, combining emulsion&#8208;mediated, on&#8208;surface crystallization of 2D nanocrystal superlattices with thermally&#8208;induced collective nanocrystal reorientation and facet&#8208;selective epitaxial fusion. Concurrent surface reconstruction exposes {110} facets along nanocrystal edges, which define the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesopores. As a proof of concept, 2D mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are employed as functional interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. These interlayers demonstrate strong polysulfide adsorption, accelerated redox kinetics, and enhanced Li+ ion transport, enabled by their multimetal&#8208;induced electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D mesoporous architecture. As a result, Li&#8211;S cells equipped with FeMnCoO&#8208;modified separators deliver exceptional electrochemical performance, even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work addresses a longstanding challenge in reconciling ordered mesoporosity with crystallographic coherence in mesoporous materials, establishing a molecularly modular approach for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel crystals with programmable compositions and facet&#8208;engineered functionality.

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7-COOH-COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N-Co-O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high-performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>
