         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic system comprising an achiral tertiary amine and a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric arylthiol was developed for the deracemization of various cyclic sulfonamides. The process involves a relay of non&#8208;enantioselective hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction and enantioselective hydrogen&#8208;atom delivery.

         <title>Multiactivity of Nanozyme Liposome Regulates the Homeostasis of Biochemical Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biomimetic liposome (CeO2@M) with nanozyme multiactivity to regulate the homeostasis of microenvironment. Artificial liposomes with negatively charged liposomes, like endothelial membranes, reduce blood component adhesion. The CeO2 nanozyme hydrolyzes ATP/ADP, lessening platelet aggregation, and regulates the level of biochemical factors such as ROS to maintain the homeostasis of the microenvironment for tissue regeneration.








Abstract
In living systems, cascade reactions involving multiple enzymes, critical for regulating the biochemical microenvironment's homeostasis, are essential to transplantation remodeling. However, for ready&#8208;to&#8208;use purposes, designing and constructing therapeutic liposomes that replicate natural cell functions during the initial transplantation phase remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology for tissue engineering. Herein, we developed a biomimetic liposome with multienzymatic nanozyme activity to regulate proinflammatory factors induced by exogenous implants. The liposomes were fabricated through the self&#8208;assembly of artificial membranes on CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). These membranes, featuring a negatively charged surface analogous to endothelial cell (EC) membranes, effectively attenuate blood component adhesion and aggregation. The CeO2 nanozyme not only hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), reducing subsequent platelet aggregation, but also regulates biochemical microenvironment homeostasis, thereby promoting tissue regeneration. This work advances the development of cell&#8208;like entities capable of modulating signaling communication between living and abiotic interfaces.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Ordering Outperforms Coordination Effects in Governing Oxygen Reduction Catalysis on High&#8208;Index Nickel Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study explored the link between ferromagnetic ordering, coordination number, and ORR activity in nickel single&#8208;crystal foils. We found that Ni (210) facets outperform Ni (310) and Ni (520) due to higher saturation magnetization and optimized d&#8208;band positioning. DFT calculations confirmed that ferromagnetic ordering, not surface coordination, drives catalytic performance by enhancing spin polarization and lowering energy barriers. External magnetic fields further boosted the activity of Ni foils.








Abstract
The role of surface spin configuration in spin&#8208;dependent catalytic reactions remains contentious, particularly when compared to the established dominance of coordination environments. Here, we resolve this debate by systematically probing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanisms on high&#8208;index Ni single&#8208;crystal facets ([210], [310], [520]) through integrated density functional theory (DFT) and experimental studies. Contrary to conventional d&#8208;band center predictions, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic ordering fundamentally dictates catalytic activity by stabilizing triplet O2 adsorption and lowering spin&#8208;forbidden transition barriers. The Ni (210) facet exhibits superior ORR performance (half&#8208;wave potential: 0.842&#160;V vs. RHE), outperforming Ni (310) and Ni (520) due to its optimized d&#8208;band center and enhanced saturation magnetization. External magnetic fields amplify this effect, yielding a 28% current density enhancement for Ni (210)&#8212;nearly triple that of Ni (520). Spin&#8208;polarized DFT calculations reveal that ferromagnetic ordering reduces the potential&#8208;determining step energy barrier for *OH desorption by 7.0%, overriding coordination&#8208;number effects. These findings establish ferromagnetic alignment as a critical design criterion for spin&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, offering a paradigm shift from coordination&#8208;centric optimization to spin&#8208;polarized interface engineering.

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Driven by Efficient Nitrate Reduction via Bimetallic Iron/Zinc Polyphthalocyanine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks enable highly efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia. When integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, this reaction facilitates rapid salt ion mass transfer, allowing the conversion of natural seawater into drinkable water and simultaneously converting nitrate contaminants into a useful chemical.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity and nitrate contamination in water sources are critical environmental sustainability challenges. We address these two challenges by coupling seawater desalination with electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) via bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks. They serve as high&#8208;performance catalysts for NO3RR toward ammonia (NH3) production. The efficient NO3RR is integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, enabling the production of freshwater from seawater and the removal of nitrate from contaminated water. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that Zn&#8208;N4 units incorporated into the Fe polyphthalocyanine framework modulate Fe&#8208;N4 sites&#8217;&#160;d&#8208;band center to enhance the adsorption of NO3&#8722; and the generation of *H, resulting in 3.22 times higher turnover frequency and highly selective reduction toward NH3. The optimized Fe8Zn1PPc delivered NH3 Faradic efficiency (&gt;97% over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.95&#160;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), the NH3 yield rate of 2.68&#160;mmol h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus RHE, and over 120&#160;h of stable operation, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts for NO3RR. The desalination device achieves the highest salt removal rates (1326.92&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 min&#8722;1) among various desalination methods. Ten cycles of natural seawater desalination to drinking water are demonstrated with 99% ion removal. This work presents an innovative solution for addressing sustainable water challenges.

         <title>Modular Access to P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of (Thio)Phosphonic Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy using newly modified chiral PIM ligands enables modular access to diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds with high stereocontrol. This approach tolerates broad functionality, constructs challenging P&#9552;S motifs, and enables late&#8208;stage nucleoside derivatization, providing a versatile platform for drug and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutic development.








Abstract
Chiral phosphorus(V) centers&#8212;particularly those bearing fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted frameworks&#8212;are key stereochemical motifs in pharmaceuticals, nucleic acid therapeutics, and functional materials. However, their stereoselective construction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A Cu-catalyzed desymmetrization strategy using newly modified chiral PIM ligands enables modular access to diverse P(V)-stereogenic compounds with high stereocontrol. This approach tolerates broad functionality, constructs challenging P&#9552;S motifs, and enables late-stage nucleoside derivatization, providing a versatile platform for drug and nucleic acid-based therapeutic development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral phosphorus(V) centers&#8212;particularly those bearing fully heteroatom-substituted frameworks&#8212;are key stereochemical motifs in pharmaceuticals, nucleic acid therapeutics, and functional materials. However, their stereoselective construction remains a long-standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a copper-catalyzed desymmetrization strategy enabled by rationally engineered PIM ligands that affords broad and modular access to structurally diverse P(V)-stereogenic compounds. By harnessing the tunable Lewis acidity and well-defined chiral environment of the catalyst&#8212;together with the distinct mechanistic features of chiral Lewis acid catalysis&#8212;this strategy overcomes the substrate scope limitations that have constrained traditional approaches. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and delivers high levels of stereocontrol across seven distinct substitution patterns, including the efficient construction of chiral P&#9552;S motifs previously considered synthetically challenging. Importantly, the approach enables efficient late-stage derivatization of nucleosides and their analogs, thereby providing a general entry point to stereodefined P(V)-containing bioactive molecules. This work not only expands the utility of transition-metal Lewis acid catalysis in phosphorus chemistry, but also establishes a versatile framework for applications in drug discovery and nucleic acid-based therapeutics where precise stereochemical control is essential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Ratchet Mechanism Accelerates Regioselective Metal&#8208;Cation Exchange in a Heterobimetallic Helicate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates form with high diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity via single&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly or self&#8208;sorting. White&#8208;light exposure autonomously operates one helicate as a molecular ratchet, promoting the selective formation of an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium structure. This ratchet mechanism furthermore accelerates regioselective metal&#8208;cation exchange from a homometallic to a heterometallic helicate.








Abstract
Molecular machines rely on their capacity to exploit non&#8208;equilibrium processes to perform work. However, the development of these non&#8208;equilibrium processes, such as molecular ratchets, is still in its early stages. Here, we report a diazocine&#8208;containing ligand (L) harbouring two distinct chelating coordination sites that can self&#8208;sort into dinuclear homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates ([FeII2L](OTf)4, [CoII2L](OTf)4, [ZnII2L](OTf)4, [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4, [ZnIICoIIL](OTf)4) with precisely controlled metal cation distribution. The photoisomerisation of the helicates operates via a molecular ratchet mechanism, resulting in metastable diastereomers that shift the system from thermodynamic equilibrium. Continuous white&#8208;light irradiation autonomously drives this ratchet process, selectively enriching an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pseudo&#8208;mesocate structure. Crucially, the ratchet mechanism can significantly accelerate metal&#8208;cation exchange from the [ZnII2L](OTf)4 helicate to the [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4 helicate. Thus, the system operates in a manner reminiscent of a &#8220;claw machine&#8221;, selectively seizing FeII ions when subjected to a precisely controllable external stimulus. These findings lay the foundation for creating adaptive and reconfigurable supramolecular structures that use non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena on a molecular level.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Alternating Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with Tunable Properties Enabled by Substitution Effects and Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structurally diversity were synthesized by a &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8208;repolymerization&#8221; strategy. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. 








Abstract
The development of innovative poly(ether&#8208;ester)s with perfectly alternating ether and ester functionalities to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. Herein, we prepared a series of enantiopure cyclic thioether&#8208;ester monomers bearing various pendant substituents by a facile &#8220;polycondensation&#8208;depolymerization&#8221; strategy. The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers will afford stereoregular poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s with structural diversity. The varieties of substituent size, position and stereo&#8208;configuration provide the opportunity to systematically investigate polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as structure&#8208;properties relationship for the resulting poly(thioether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s. The strategic positioning of &#945;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;substituents coupled with stereoregular chain architectures and stereocomplex formation enables wide&#8208;range modulation of the polymer's thermal and mechanical properties. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. Of note, these polymers can be chemically recycled by either ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or alcoholysis, with high monomer regeneration efficiency. The systematic investigation of substitution effects and structure&#8208;property relationships in this work provides a molecular blueprint for designing novel chemically recyclable polymers with high performance.

         <title>Nature of Anti&#8208;Dissipative High&#8208;Energy Excited States in Quaterpyridine&#8208;Bridged Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoexcitation, meta&#8208;connected quaterpyridine&#8208;bridged Ru complexes undergo fast inter&#8208;ligand electron transfer like typical chromophores, but unusually slow intra&#8208;ligand electron transfer within bridge&#8208;centered MLCT states. The energy saved was exploited for photoreductions and photooxidations with model electron donors and acceptors, respectively. Design guidelines involving ancillary&#8208;ligand substitution and bridge topology were derived.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy excited states with slow rates for internal conversion to the lowest&#8208;energy excited state are prone to be intercepted before they dissipate energy to the medium. In a previous report, oligomeric Ru(II) photosensitizers bearing a bridging 2,2&#8242;:5&#8242;,3&#8243;:6&#8243;,2&#8244;&#8211;quaterpyridine scaffold showed promising anti&#8208;dissipative behavior in photoinduced electron transfer reactivity. In here, a range of electron accepting and electron donating substituents were incorporated on the ancillary 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands to modulate the excited&#8208;state dynamics. This allowed to unambiguously identify the nature of high&#8208;energy excited states and derive design guidelines for the achievement of anti&#8208;dissipative behavior in oligomeric Ru(II) polypyridines relevant for solar fuels production and photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Electrolytes with Tailored Solvent&#8211;Solvent Interactions for Flame&#8208;Retardant Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work, by introducing solvent&#8211;solvent interactions, achieves an ion&#8208;aggregate&#8208;rich solvation structure at low concentrations, promoting the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, effectively suppressing the reaction between trimethyl phosphate and the sodium metal anode, thereby enabling stable cycling of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs), which possess abundant sodium resources and high energy density, have attracted widespread attention.

&lt;p&gt;This work, by introducing solvent&#8211;solvent interactions, achieves an ion-aggregate-rich solvation structure at low concentrations, promoting the formation of an inorganic-rich SEI, effectively suppressing the reaction between trimethyl phosphate and the sodium metal anode, thereby enabling stable cycling of Na||Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; battery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium metal batteries (SMBs), which possess abundant sodium resources and high energy density, have attracted widespread attention. However, the continuous reaction between the electrolyte and the sodium metal anode, along with the formation of an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), leads to rapid capacity decay and the safety hazard of potential ignition. In this work, designing a low-cost and flame-retardant electrolyte with solvent&#8211;solvent interactions is achieved by introducing sodium-difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) as a single salt into the ester-based electrolyte on the basis of trimethyl phosphate. Theoretical research combined with experimental study disclose through the solvent&#8211;solvent interactions, an ion-aggregate-rich solvation structure is formed at low concentrations, leading to the formation of a gradient SEI enriched with inorganic compounds such as B and F on the anode. This effectively suppresses interfacial reactions and sodium dendrite growth, significantly improving the cycling stability along with the optimizing the safety of SMBs. The Na||Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; battery using this electrolyte maintains a high-capacity retention of 93% after 5000 cycles (320 days) at 1C. This approach provides a reliable solution for the application of flame-retardant electrolytes in SMBs, which also sheds light on the designing principle of advanced battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant and Self&#8208;Adaptive Surface&#8208;Initiated Bimetal&#8208;Mediated Controlled Radical Polymerization</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a novel and versatile self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional polymer brushes under ambient conditions with exceptional oxygen tolerance. By introducing a bimetal CuZn alloy, the system self&#8208;adaptively regulates the dissociation of copper species, ensuring robust and controllable polymer brush growth across a wide range of distances between the bimetallic alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate.








Abstract
We report herein a self&#8208;adaptive surface&#8208;initiated bimetal&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (SI&#8208;BMCRP) for fabricating various polymer brushes using microliter volumes under ambient conditions. The introduction of bimetal CuZn alloy can self&#8208;adaptively control the dissociation of copper species while still realizing the controllability of polymer brush growth with high oxygen tolerance at a wide range of distances between the bimetal alloy and the initiator&#8208;modified substrate. The successful fabrication of multiscale and multifunctional polymer brushes with high&#8208;end group fidelity and patterned architectures further demonstrates the robust nature of SI&#8208;BMCRP. The resultant polymer brushes show great potential for new applications in moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation, breath monitoring, and speech recognition.

         <title>ABC&#8208;seq Expands Small RNAs Profiling with Successive Nucleic Acid Structure&#8208;Differentiated Enzymatic Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce ABC&#8208;seq, a versatile smRNA&#8208;seq method addressing challenges in library construction, such as adapter ligation biases, dimer byproducts, and amplification bias. ABC&#8208;seq employs successive enhanced recognition for smRNAs and integrates randomized adapters as UMIs for precise quantification, leveraging nucleic acid structural differences between smRNAs libraries and adapter dimers, supported by robust validation and biological data.








Abstract
Small RNAs (smRNAs) play crucial roles in gene regulation, but current sequencing methods face a set of tangled challenges, including adapter ligation bias, high adapter dimer byproducts, and amplification variability, which limit their capacity to fully capture smRNA diversity. Here, we develop ABC&#8208;seq, a general strategy to enhance smRNA recognition through successive structure&#8208;differentiated recognition. We designed two randomized adapters, each containing a restriction enzyme recognition motif or a cleavage site. Then, we operate two product structure&#8208;differentiated enzymatic reactions to maximally suppress randomized adapter dimer. Furthermore, the randomized sequence in adapters serves as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in smRNA&#8208;seq data analysis to correct amplification bias and improves quantification accuracy. Using ABC&#8208;seq, we identified a wider range of smRNAs, including miRNAs, scRNAs, and snoRNAs, in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, detecting 9.4% more miRNAs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, ABC&#8208;seq revealed smRNAs associated with cancer drug responses and their roles in immune modulation in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer. ABC&#8208;seq expands the smRNA landscape and offers new insights into complex gene regulatory networks.

         <title>Operando XAFS Deciphering Dynamic Evolution of Heteronuclear Cu&#8211;Ni From Atomic Sites to Atomic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the intrinsic potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction of Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear sites during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Through operando XAFS and microscopy, we reveal the potential&#8208;driven transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7). The tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs effectively reduce the occupancy of Cu 3d&#8211;C 2p antibonding orbitals, thereby promoting CO2 protonation and significantly accelerating eCO2RR kinetics.








Abstract
Revealing the dynamic evolution of atomic&#8208;level active sites during catalytic reactions is critical for identifying true catalytic centers and optimizing the adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, elucidating the dynamic atomic/electronic transformation mechanisms of metal sites in multimetallic systems and achieving atomic&#8208;level control remains challenging. Here, we report a potential&#8208;dependent in&#8208;plane atomic reconstruction intrinsic to Cu&#8211;Ni heteronuclear atomic sites during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and microscopy unveil the transformation of asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ni dimers into fully exposed Cux&#8211;Ni atomic clusters (Cux&#8211;Ni ACs, x&#160;=&#160;3&#8211;7) at potentials from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.2&#160;V versus RHE, anchored on porous carbon through N/S coordination. The Cu&#8208;rich evolution reshapes geometric structures of active sites, inducing gradual electron localization, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy of CO2 intermediates as evidenced by operando measurements and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the tailored Cu5&#8211;Ni ACs formed at &#8722;0.9&#160;V reduce the antibonding orbital occupancy between Cu 3d and C 2p states, facilitating CO2 protonation and enhancing eCO2RR kinetics. These findings demonstrate high CO selectivity and catalytic stability, providing fundamental insights into the dynamic reconstruction and catalytic mechanism of atomic&#8208;scale active sites.

         <title>Merging One&#8208; and Multi&#8208;Photon Processes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Enhanced NIR Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal and Photochemical Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a paradigm for the development of highly stable and multifunctional HOF materials to enable the full&#8208;spectrum utilization of sunlight, which is achieved through a dual&#8208;process mechanism involving one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitations, facilitated by direct absorption of NIR light within a single HOF platform, for synergistically enhanced performance in photothermal, photochemical, and chiroptical applications.








Abstract
Direct application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for solar&#8208;thermal and solar&#8208;chemical conversions is of emergent interest to improving efficiency in solar&#8208;energy utilization. Herein, we report a synthetic approach to NIR&#8208;responsive materials by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;1/2/3) from multifunctionalized Ru&#8208;components incorporating chiral, photoactive, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;stacking, and protonation/deprotonation subunits. Significantly, protonation of the imidazole&#8208;subunits in HOF&#8208;3 promotes densified packing to extend NIR absorption tail up to 1100&#160;nm with a narrowed bandgap of 1.41&#160;eV, meanwhile leads to spontaneous resolution of enantiomeric &#916;&#8208;/&#923;&#8208;HOF&#8208;3. Consequently, remarkably enhanced photothermal effect and photocatalytic performance, including chiroptical activity induced by circularly polarized NIR light, are achieved through synergy of direct one&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon NIR absorption, underscoring effectiveness to bring multifunctionalities into ordered HOFs for generation of robust and effective materials with multimode NIR responsiveness.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Carbazolyl Cyanobenzene Conjugates: Enabling Biomolecule Functionalization via Photoredox and Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce two methods for incorporating carbazolyl cyanobenzenes onto peptides: a C&#8208;terminus decarboxylative functionalization and a Cys&#8208;selective SNAr reaction. Both conjugates exhibit excellent photoredox/energy&#8208;transfer properties, enabling their use for C&#8208;terminal alkynylation and Cys&#8208;selective thiol&#8208;ene reactions on peptides, as well as proximity&#8208;driven labeling next to integrin &#945;v&#946;3 by aryl azide excitation in living cells.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2012, carbazolyl (iso)phthalonitrile (Cz(I)PN) derivatives have found significant applications as photocatalysts (PCs) in organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce two efficient methods for incorporating carbazolyl cyanobenzenes into various peptide sequences. The first method involves a photomediated decarboxylative functionalization of the C&#8208;terminus of peptides, leading to the formation of various carbazolyl benzonitrile (CzBN) derivatives. The second method exploits a cysteine&#8208;selective SNAr reaction on a fluorinated arene precursor, resulting in novel peptide&#8208;3CzIPN (triscarbazolyl&#8208;isophthalonitrile) conjugates. Both types of conjugates maintain delayed fluorescence properties, exhibit similar or wider redox potential, and possess higher excited state energy when compared to currently used cyanoarenes. We demonstrated the photocatalytic activity of these conjugates first through a photo&#8208;mediated peptide C&#8208;terminal decarboxylative alkynylation. Then, water&#8208;soluble peptide conjugates were used to catalyze a thiol&#8208;ene reaction on cysteine in aqueous media. Finally, we achieved protein labeling via aryl azide excitation both in vitro and at the cellular level using peptide&#8208;CzIPN conjugates. By incorporating a peptide ligand of the protein integrin &#945;v&#946;3, proximity&#8208;driven labeling next to this target was realized by aryl azide excitation in living cells, showing an excellent overlap with antibody&#8208;based imaging. These findings reveal the potential of cyanoarene&#8208;peptide conjugates for proximity&#8208;driven photochemistry in a complex biological context.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Cathode Constructed Solely by Carbon Dots for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots are solely applied as the active cathode material in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries for the first time, which exhibit decent cycling performance, excellent capacity retention, and ultrahigh ion diffusion ability.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have been explored widely in the electrochemistry field, owing to their unique structures and rich properties. However, in the reported devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, CDs are always used as additives to modify the electrodes or regulate the electrolytes because they have been regarded as inert and low&#8208;capacity materials all along. Here, for the first time, o&#8208;phenylenediamine derived CDs are selected as the only protagonist to construct cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such CDs (p&#8208;CDs) have a special &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenazine&#8208;based structure, with carbon cores for electrical conductivity and active sites for embedding Zn2+ and H+. The p&#8208;CDs solely constructed cathode material delivers a superior capacity of 290&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and a decent capacity of 103&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 10&#160;A g&#8722;1, as well as an ultrahigh ion diffusion coefficient of 10&#8722;8&#160;&#8764;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;cm2 s&#8722;1. The p&#8208;CDs assembled ZIBs exhibit a stable long&#8208;term cycling, retaining 87.4% of the original capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles. Various characterizations and theoretical calculations prove that the electron&#8208;deficient N as the active sites on p&#8208;CDs can embed/release Zn2+ and H+ reversibly.

         <title>Location&#8208;Differentiated DNA Hierarchical Cyclic Construction Demarcating Identical Biomolecules Across Cell Membrane Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial demarcation of identical biomolecules across distinct cell membrane microenvironments has not been well determined. Here we report location&#8208;differentiated DNA hierarchical cyclic construction for lipid raft&#8208;differentiated spatial profiling in living cells. It can differentially visualize identical biomolecules inside and outside lipid rafts, and quantitatively measures molecule distribution rate (lipid raft to the whole cell membrane).








Abstract
Local molecular composition across cell membrane microenvironments exerts profound effects on cellular physiology and pathology. Yet spatial demarcation of identical biomolecules inside and outside lipid raft microdomains has not been determined. Here we report location&#8208;differentiated DNA hierarchical cyclic construction for lipid raft&#8208;differentiated spatial profiling of identical biomolecules in living cells. It contains two sequential DNA cyclic construction reactions: primary one triggered by total target molecules and secondary one activated by lipid raft's location markers proximal to target molecules. Using this method, we differentially visualize identical biomolecules localized in lipid raft and non&#8208;lipid raft microdomains with different signals. We demonstrate the robustness and universality of this method by testing cell surface RNAs and proteins in diverse cell types. We reveal their diverse spatial demarcation with intrinsic heterogeneity. In both lipid raft&#8208;disrupting cells and senescent cells, MUC1 protein is dynamically organized between these two microdomains. Our strategy provides a promising avenue to investigate physiological and pathological functions of dynamic molecular compositions across cellular microenvironments.

         <title>Tunable Oxygen Vacancy Clusters Enhanced Catalytic Activity of CeO2 Nanorods on CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and halogen&#8208;free strategy for CO2 cycloaddition is achieved using CeO2 nanorods enriched with oxygen vacancy clusters. The Ce3+ ions and lattice oxygens in the vicinity of the vacancy clusters construct abundant frustrated Lewis pair sites, which boost substrate adsorption and activation, reduce reaction energy barriers, stabilize intermediates, and accelerate product desorption.








Abstract
Constructing heterogeneous halogen&#8208;free catalysts featuring efficiently activated CO2 and epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via an atom&#8208;economical route is significant but remains a big challenge. In this work, we develop an atmosphere&#8208;assisted strategy for preparing mesoporous CeO2 nanorods with tunable oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations, which boosts the performance of CO2 cycloaddition. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis elucidates that oxygen vacancy clusters regulate the dynamic equilibrium of the multiscale structure of CeO2 via a synergistic &#8220;compression&#8208;expansion&#8221; mechanism. Furthermore, the high concentrations of oxygen vacancy clusters form abundant frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) sites, which remarkably promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 with epoxides. Thus, the performance of CO2 cycloaddition was substantially intensified. A 95% yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when the reaction was conducted with RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 at 110&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the kinetic properties and the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition on FLP sites in RNR&#8208;CeO2&#8208;H2 were investigated based on the in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts with tunable FLP sites for the efficient activation and conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals by modulating oxygen vacancy cluster concentrations.

         <title>Azine&#8208;Pyridine Frame Generated Covalent Organic Frameworks and Self&#8208;Polymerized Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a family of azine&#8208;pyridine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that promote proton and electron transport through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. These COFs exhibit thermochromism, self&#8208;assemble into meter&#8208;scale films, and show enhanced heavy metal ion reduction, UV shielding, and battery performance, offering new opportunities in reticular chemistry, environmental science, and energy storage.








Abstract
Engineering covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into industrializable films with inherent functionalities has remained a major challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, through developing skeletal azine&#8208;pyridine conformation, we present an effectual synthetic frame to convert a family of powdery COFs into self&#8208;polymerized COFs films under green and ambient conditions. The active proton tautomerism in our azine&#8208;pyridine frame offers a thermochromism, facilitating self&#8208;polymerization of large&#8208;area COFs films from ca. 10&#160;nm to &gt;30&#160;&#181;m thickness with outstanding chemical stability, industrializable processability, and mechanical strength. More remarkably, our azine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based COFs first display various fresh properties, i.e., up to 1913 and 624&#160;mg g&#8722;1 reducing capacities on ions of Au3+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Au0 and Cr6+&#160;&#8594;&#160;Cr3+, 99.9% UV&#8208;blue light shielding and 97.2% transmissivity of visible lights and 10&#8208;fold increase in Zn battery lifetime. We expect that the azine&#8208;pyridine synthetic frame will serve as a generalizable route to boost the development of reticular chemistry, environmental science, and nano&#8208;electronics.

&lt;p&gt;We report a family of azine-pyridine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that promote proton and electron transport through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. These COFs exhibit thermochromism, self-assemble into meter-scale films, and show enhanced heavy metal ion reduction, UV shielding, and battery performance, offering new opportunities in reticular chemistry, environmental science, and energy storage.

         <title>Simple and Rapid Tumor EV Enrichment Enabled by Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided Entanglement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective isolation of extracellular vesicle (EV) subpopulations is essential for their biomedical applications. We present a simple, rapid, and versatile strategy termed LODGE (Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided EV Entanglement) for the enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from biofluids. LODGE facilitates the application of tEVs in biomarker discovery, therapeutic agents, and disease diagnosis, as evidenced by proteomic profiling, bioactivity assays, and cancer classification.








Abstract
Specific subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold significant clinical potential for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic agents. However, this field remains underutilized due to the lack of straightforward and versatile techniques for isolating EV subpopulations from biofluids. Here, we present LODGE, a long DNA probe&#8208;guided EV entanglement strategy for the simple, rapid, and selective enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from clinical specimens. LODGE uses two long DNA affinity probes to recognize specific subpopulations, causing them to aggregate with the assistance of splint strands, thereby achieving nondestructive, high&#8208;yield, and high&#8208;purity separation of tEVs within a short period. Proteomic analysis revealed that the isolated tEVs contributed to the identification of tumor&#8208;associated biomarkers compared to total EVs. Additionally, by incorporating a split G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;containing molecular trap domain, a novel structure that significantly improves the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T (ThT), into DNA affinity probes, we developed an innovative LODGE&#8208;ThT sensing strategy for the highly sensitive profiling of multiple tEV subpopulations. Using data from the tEVs alongside clinical indicators processed with machine learning algorithms, we effectively classified five tumor types. Our results show that LODGE is a promising tool for identifying specific EV subpopulations, and fostering their biomedical applications.

         <title>Resiquimod&#8208;Induced Nanovaccine (RINV) for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the dual roles of resiquimod (R848) as both an immune stimulant and a structural unit, this study conjugates R848 onto fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer to develop an antigen carrier G5&#8208;R848. G5&#8208;R848 forms stable nanovaccines with OVA model antigen or tumor lysates and facilitates cytosolic antigen delivery. The nanovaccines demonstrate potent DCs maturation and cross&#8208;presentation and elicit significantly increased tumor antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell responses.








Abstract
Cancer nanovaccines have emerged as a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy due to their capability of eliciting robust tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. However, structural complexity and insufficient spatiotemporal coordination of immune activation pose substantial challenges for optimizing the therapeutic potential of nanovaccines. Herein, a resiquimod&#8208;induced nanovaccine (RINV) is devised for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) was covalently conjugated to fifth&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;PAMAM) dendrimer through a disulfide linker to obtain the vaccine carrier G5&#8208;R848. In this design, R848 not only fulfills its biological role as a vaccine adjuvant but facilitates uniform nanovaccine formation with the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) due to its distinctive chemical structure. Redox&#8208;triggered intracellular R848 release further promotes cytosolic delivery of antigen and subsequent antigen cross&#8208;presentation. In vivo studies demonstrated that the nanovaccine induces remarkable prophylactic and therapeutic effects in the B16F10&#8208;OVA melanoma model. Moreover, G5&#8208;R848 forms personalized nanovaccines by complexing with cell lysates from resected B16F10 and 4T1 tumor tissues, effectively inhibiting postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Encapsulating Ionophores in Zeolite Imidazolate Framework&#8208;8 for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Ion Fluctuations in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, ionophore was encapsulated in zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticle for long&#8208;term ion recognition with high stability. The mechanical mismatch between implanted electrodes and brain tissue was addressed by sputtering gold nanoparticles (AuNP) on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers as a flexible electrode substrate. This study provides a versatile strategy for developing ion&#8208;selective microsensors that well meet the demands of long&#8208;term in vivo monitoring.








Abstract
Various ions in the brain (e.g., H+, K+, and Ca2+) play essential roles in neural information transmission and physiopathological processes. Real&#8208;time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long&#8208;term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion&#8208;selective microsensor for long&#8208;term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long&#8208;term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer&#8208;based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Hollow Microreactors with Catalytic Nanobrushes for Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated living CDSA endows the engineering of the surface of hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures and enables specific inner&#8208;outer spatial isolation of various catalytic species on tailored microreactor. Notably, the microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes and internal Pt&#8208;Ni alloys revealed prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine (95.4% sel.).








Abstract
Micro/nanoreactors with hollow structures have traditionally focused on the design of the internal catalytic microenvironment, while precise engineering of their external surfaces at a nanoscale level is particularly rare. Here, we develop a unique approach to elaborately engineer the surface of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;based hollow microreactor with fluff&#8208;like nanostructures that serve as an external catalytic platform. This involves the anchoring of high&#8208;density micellar brushes onto the epidermis of ZIF&#8208;8 via surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, followed by the rapid capture of multiple species to fabricate the catalytic nanobrushes. Such a nanoscale fluff&#8208;like surface in combination with an internal cavity that encapsulates other functional components enables specific spatial isolation of various catalysts. The resultant microreactor with external PW12 nanobrushes for esterification and internal Pt&#9472;Ni alloys for hydrogenation reveals prominent activity toward a tandem conversion of p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid into benzocaine with a high selectivity of 95.4%. Remarkably, the microreactor decorated with PW12 nanobrushes can greatly prompt the catalytic efficiency of esterification with the inhibited competition from the hydrogenation reaction. Overall, this work provides an innovative guidance for the rational creation of multifunctional microreactors with fine surface nanostructures.

         <title>Asymmetric,&#160;Corner&#8208;Sharing&#160;CuO5 and CuO6 Motifs in Cu&#8208;Based Metallic Perovskite Oxides Boosting Asymmetric C&#8208;C Coupling for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides feature significant potential for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) but encounter insufficient C2+ selectivity primarily due to the inherent symmetric charge distribution at Cu sites hindering asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling. Here we report a unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with&#160;asymmetric,&#160;corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs to boost asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst of La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, their ordered, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 pyramids and CuO6 octahedra feature localized charge density redistribution, creating abundant asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites with distinct electronic structures and also strengthening Cu&#8208;O covalency. In CO2RR (in both alkaline and acidic media), La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; greatly promotes C2+ formation while producing negligible CH4, showing a Faradaic efficiency ratio (C2+ to CH4) of up to 180. Moreover, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, achieving a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 85.0% at 400 mA cm&#8208;2, together with well&#8208;boosted stability, outperforms previously reported Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalysts. Our experiments and theoretical calculations attribute the superb performance mainly to the following factors: the asymmetric CuO5&#8208;CuO6 sites promoting differentiated *CO adsorption/hydrogenation to favor asymmetric *CO&#8208;*CHO coupling; the strengthened Cu&#8208;O covalency stabilizing the Cu sites. Extending this strategy to two additional pairs of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides generates similarly successful results.</dc:description>

The &#8220;pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#8221; electrolyte employs the amide polymer encapsulation matrix (APEM) to construct localized charge&#8208;transfer channels toward solvents, tuning the negative charge center. The APEM promotes cation&#8208;anion coordination in the primary solvation sheath, establishing the AGGs&#8208;dominated interface, thereby achieving excellent wide&#8208;temperature performance (&#8722;40&#8764;80&#160;&#176;C) and high energy density (490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).








Abstract
Electric vehicles and electric aircraft demand all&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, the interaction mechanism between charge transfer in the solvation sheath and interfacial evolution is not yet clear. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#8221; strategy by introducing an amide polymer encapsulation matrix (APEM) to construct local charge&#8208;transfer channels to solvents for tuning the negative charge center. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron X&#8208;ray tomography reveal that the APEM drags out the polar solvent and promotes cation&#8208;anion coordination in the primary solvation sheath, contributing to AGGs&#8208;dominated interfacial solvation chemistry. The designed electrolyte improves the cyclability of Li|LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 up to 300 cycles at 4.6&#160;V and high&#8208;temperature capability at 80&#160;&#176;C. Even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, it still delivers a high capacity of 87.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with negligible capacity decay for 160 cycles. Industrial 3&#160;Ah&#8208;level pouch cells over 490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 exhibit 91.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles, manifesting high potential in extreme applications.

         <title>Automated Iterative N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated iterative assembly of MIDA or TIDA boronate building blocks enables generalized and automated preparation of many different types of small functional molecules in a modular fashion. However, until now, this engine could not leverage nitrogen atoms as iteration handles, excluding molecules rich in N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bonds. Here, we disclose a new iteration&#8208;enabling group, CbzT, that reversibly attenuates the reactivity of nitrogen atoms and enables generalized catch&#8208;and&#8208;release purification. Leveraging CbzT, we achieve the automated modular synthesis of Imatinib (Gleevec), a widely used drug. This work substantially expands the range of small molecules that can be synthesized using automated block chemistry.








Abstract
Small molecule solutions to many contemporary societal challenges await discovery, but the artisanal and manual process via which this class of chemical matter is typically accessed limits the discovery of new functions. Automated assembly of (N&#8208;methyl iminodiacetic acid) MIDA or (tetramethyl N&#8208;methyl iminodiacetic acid) TIDA boronate building blocks via iterative C&#9472;C bond formation, an approach we call &#8220;block chemistry&#8221;, alternatively enables generalized and automated preparation of many different types of small molecules in a modular fashion. But in its current form, this engine cannot also leverage nitrogen atoms as iteration handles. Here, we disclose a new iteration&#8208;enabling group, CbzT (p&#8208;TIDA boronate&#8208;substituted carboxybenzyl), that reversibly attenuates the reactivity of nitrogen atoms and enables generalized catch&#8208;and&#8208;release purification. CbzT is leveraged to achieve the automated modular synthesis of Imatinib (Gleevec), an archetypical clinically approved kinase inhibitor, in which building blocks are iteratively linked by both N&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bonds. This work substantially expands the types of small molecules that can be iteratively assembled in an automated modular fashion. It also advances the concept of intentionally developing chemistry that machines can do.

         <title>Zwitterionic Heavier Pnictinidenes in Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic pnictinidenes: A new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species stabilized by bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate ligands is reported, enabling the isolation of Sb and Bi in multiple oxidation states. These thoroughly characterized systems exhibit cationic character and engage in redox catalysis, facilitating catalytic hydrodefluorination and dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes, expanding the scope of main group redox chemistry.








Abstract
Herein, we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low&#8208;valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Access to P&#8208;Chiral Triarylphosphine Oxides via Insertion of P&#9472;H Bonds into Diazonaphthoquinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric insertion of P&#9472;H bond into carbene has been developed to access P&#8208;chiral phosphine oxides in excellent enantioselectivity.








Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the enantioselective insertion of carbenes into heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds, this chemistry is restricted to the construction of carbon&#8208;based chirality. The asymmetric insertion of carbenes into P&#9472;H that delivers P&#8208;chiral products remains untouched.

&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric insertion of P&#9472;H bond into carbene has been developed to access P-chiral phosphine oxides in excellent enantioselectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While significant progress has been made in the enantioselective insertion of carbenes into heteroatom-hydrogen bonds, this chemistry is restricted to the construction of carbon-based chirality. The asymmetric insertion of carbenes into P&#9472;H that delivers P-chiral products remains untouched. Rhodium(I)-catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of P-chiral triarylphosphine oxides via asymmetric C&#9472;P coupling of a secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) with diazonaphthoquinone is herein reported. Driven by aromatization, this protocol affords a variety of P-chiral triarylphosphine oxides tethered to a 2-naphthol functionality in excellent enantioselectivity by following a kinetic resolution reaction pattern. The diverse synthetic and catalytic applications of the P-chiral products highlight the value of this method, even though the derivatized trivalent chiral phosphine bears a rather low barrier of racemization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Chemoselectivity in the Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) Alkyne Cyclotrimerization</title>

Chemoselectivity Challenge: A precise catalyst design allows for chemoselectivity control over alkyne reactivity to yield pentafulvenes via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) cyclotrimerization. Operative mechanism has been elucidated by means of stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations.








Abstract
The synthesis of pentafulvenes with varied substituents has been efficiently achieved using novel rhodium&#8208;based catalysts via (2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1) alkyne cyclotrimerization. A rational design of the catalyst structure, including pyridonato, NHC, and CO ligands, ensures the alkyne chemoselectivity and prevents the formation of robust rhodium&#8208;fulvene species. Furthermore, the judicious choice of acidity and steric properties of different alkynes enables the preparation of cross&#8208;coupled fulvene derivatives. Stoichiometric and deuteration experiments, as well as DFT calculations, shed light on the reaction mechanism, showing that it includes an initial alkyne deprotonation, two successive alkyne insertions, cyclization, and protonolysis, the first insertion being the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Unexpected Activities of CYP152 Peroxygenases Toward Non&#8208;carboxylic Substrates Reveal Novel Substrate Recognition Mechanism and Catalytic Versatility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study unveils novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities of CYP152 peroxygenases toward various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group. Mechanistic analyses provide new insights into non&#8208;carboxylic substrate&#8208;assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis for hydrogen peroxide activation, inspiring potential applications in industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.








Abstract
Exploring and exploiting the catalytic promiscuity of enzymes is a central topic and captivating challenge in enzymology. CYP152 peroxygenases are attractive biocatalysts for diverse reactions under mild conditions using H2O2 as cofactor. However, their substrate scope is limited by a carboxyl group required for substrate assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis, following the well&#8208;accepted principle that heme&#8208;dependent H2O2&#8208;utilizing enzymes employ a carboxyl group within their active sites to facilitate H2O2 activation. Herein, we reveal for the first time that several CYP152 family members can directly degrade various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group, exhibiting novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities. Through crystal structure analysis, isotope tracing experiments, and QM/MM calculations, we elucidate that the phenolic hydroxyl group activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent(s) functionally replaces the carboxyl group, forming hydrogen bonds with the conserved arginine leading to Compound I formation. The oxygen atom of the newly formed hydroxyl group originates from water, bypassing the conventional oxygen rebound step. These findings provide first insights into the mechanisms of P450 peroxygenases toward non&#8208;carboxylic substrates, expanding our knowledge of biological C&#9472;H activation and C&#8208;halogen bond cleavage beyond canonical P450 reactions. This discovery holds immense potential for harnessing these enzymes in innovative strategies for industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.

         <title>Si/Carbon&#8208;dots with Surface N&#8208;C Sites Promoting Proton and Electron Transfers in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH step is considered the rate&#8208;determining step in the oxygen reduction reaction. Silane chain&#8208;grafted carbon dots with N&#8208;C active sites help overcome the energy barrier through promoting proton and electron transfers, thereby enhancing H2O2 production in photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed through either a two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron pathway, both of which are important for a wide range of applications. The intermediate conversion of *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH recognized as the rate&#8208;determining step in ORR, with its efficiency strongly dependent on the nature of active sites at the surface of a catalyst. Herein, Si&#8208;supported carbon dots (Si&#8208;CDs) are introduced as cocatalysts in a photocatalytic system, where their nitrogen&#8211;carbon sites play a pivotal role in lowering the energy barrier for *OOH formation by promoting proton and electron transfers, thus enhancing the H2O2 production rate in ORR. This strategy is broadly applicable across a wide range of photocatalysts, both with and without use of sacrificial agents. The H2O2 production rate for Zn0.5Cd0.5S (30&#160;mg) increased from 13.0 to 40.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 when 0.6&#160;mg of Si&#8208;CDs were added. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations are conducted to reveal the reaction pathway and the reduced energy requirements for the *O2&#8315; + H&#8314; &#8594; *OOH conversion. This study provides a unique example of overcoming a key barrier in ORR using a metal&#8208;free catalyst and promotes potential applications in various fields.

         <title>Mechanistic Promiscuity in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated CO2 Reduction Reaction: One&#8208; Versus Two&#8208;Electron Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobalt complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2&#8314;, and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2&#8314; show contrasting CO&#8322; reduction behaviors. [(Hbbpya)CoII]2&#8314; selectively forms CO via a fast, two&#8208;electron pathway aided by a &#8208;NH proton relay, while [(Mebbpya)CoII]2&#8314; favours hydrogen evolution due to a slower, competitive one&#8208;electron mechanism. Stopped&#8208;flow studies reveal a reactive CO&#8322; radical anion, offering insights into their distinct catalytic pathways.








Abstract
We compare the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) activity and selectivity of the complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+, which contain two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine chelating groups linked by &#8208;NH or &#8208;NCH3 moieties, respectively. Whereas [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ forms CO under electrocatalytic conditions in presence of phenol (PhOH) with high selectivity, [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+ shows higher hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low selectivity for CO production. The molecular origin of the difference in product selectivity was analysed based on spectroscopic trapping of reactive intermediates and detailed kinetic and theoretical studies. A difference in mechanism is evident; whereas an efficient proton relay mediated by the &#8208;NH group initiates a two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 in the case of [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+, one&#8208;electron chemistry prevails for [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+. Under stopped&#8208;flow conditions, we trapped the one&#8208;electron reduced CO2 radical anion in [(Mebbpya)CoI(CO2&#8722;&#8226;)], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions. This study underlines the importance of subtle electronic and protonation changes in controlling the CO2RR product selectivity.

   &lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, one-electron chemistry prevails for [&lt;b&gt;(Mebbpya)Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Under stopped-flow conditions, we trapped the one-electron reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radical anion in [&lt;b&gt;(Mebbpya)Co&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions. This study underlines the importance of subtle electronic and protonation changes in controlling the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR product selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Chemical Scissors Strategy Enables 1D Antimony Selenates with Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III)&#8212;were successfully designed and synthesized via dual chemical scissors strategy. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong SHG response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for UV NLO applications.








Abstract
The rational, function&#8208;driven design of advanced inorganic functional materials remains a significant challenge, primarily attributed to their inherently complex and highly connected 3D frameworks of most oxide&#8208;based systems. Herein, we report a &#8220;dual chemical scissors&#8221; strategy that synergistically combines the effects of fluoride ions and stereochemically active lone pairs to precisely modulate local coordination environments and enable controlled dimensional reduction. Using this approach, we successfully synthesized the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric 1D antimony selenates&#8212;RbSbF2SeO4 (I), Rb2Sb2F6SeO4 (II), and Rb2Sb3F9SeO4 (III). These compounds feature well&#8208;defined helical chain structures constructed from SbOxFy polyhedra and SeO4 tetrahedra, resulting in pronounced optical anisotropy and robust nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Among the series, RbSbF2SeO4 (I) stands out with an exceptional combination of a broad optical transparency window (0.26&#8211;10&#160;&#181;m), a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), and moderate birefringence (0.12 at 546&#160;nm), positioning it as a highly promising candidate for ultraviolet NLO applications. This work establishes a powerful and generalizable structural design paradigm for constructing polar low&#8208;dimensional architectures and underscores the effectiveness of targeted coordination modulation in advancing high&#8208;performance optical materials.

         <title>Trigonal Planar Bis(carbene)Cu(I) Complexes Enable Divergent H2 Activation with H2O for Accelerated Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trigonal planar naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene)Cu(I) alkyl, hydroxide, and ethoxide complexes promote a divergent mechanism of H2 activation for the rare catalytic hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes at mild conditions at copper. 








Abstract
CuH&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydrogenation is rare compared to those of carbonyl&#8208;derived substrates. Olefin insertion into Cu&#8211;H to form Cu&#8208;alkyl is ubiquitous; however, subsequent H2 activation remains unknown to our knowledge. Herein, we investigated the transformations of &#946;&#8208;H elimination, H2 cleavage, and catalytic olefin hydrogenation in a series of linear and trigonal planar Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl complexes supported by monodentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and bidentate naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligands, respectively. Contrary to unreactive linear species, trigonal planar variants promote &#946;&#8208;H elimination, hydrogenolysis, and catalytic hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes at mild temperatures and H2 pressure. The rare isolation of a naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene)CuH monomer further affirms two predominant competing pathways for H2 cleavage of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity at Cu(I)&#8208;alkyl or internal electrophilic substitution at Cu(I)&#8208;OH. Employing either isolated or in situ generated Cu(I)&#8208;OH complex, via protonolysis of alkyl precatalyst by adventitious water, significantly accelerated catalysis compared to that operating primarily by the metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity pathway. DFT calculations and energy decomposition analysis on the disparate &#946;&#8208;H elimination reactivity between linear and trigonal planar tert&#8208;butyl complexes and the mechanism of H2 activation at a hydroxide complex, indicate that coordination geometry at Cu(I) and properties of the naphthyridine&#8208;bis(carbene) ligand are integral to the transformations reported here.

         <title>Regioreversed Carbosulfenylation of Fluoroalkenes via Nickel&#8208;Mediated Radical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed unconventional 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of fluoroalkenes provides efficient access to sulfide and fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing products. Preliminary mechanistic studies support a pathway involving thiyl radical generation via HAT, addition to the alkene, and subsequent nickel&#8208;mediated benzylation.








Abstract
Carbosulfenylation of olefins represents an important class of reactions for the synthesis of structurally diverse organosulfur compounds. Previous studies typically yield 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity. In the context of diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis, accessing the regioreversed products is desirable, significantly broadening the scope of these reactions. In this study, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed 2,1&#8208;carbosulfenylation of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, using free thiols and benzyl bromides as sulfur and carbon sources, respectively. The unusual regioselectivity observed is enabled by a &#8220;radical sorting&#8221; mechanism. The Ni catalyst activates benzyl bromide to generate a benzylic radical that undergoes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the thiol to form a sulfur&#8208;centered radical. The sulfur radical subsequently adds to the fluoroalkenes, resulting in an &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl C&#8208;radical. This radical undergoes SH2 with a Ni&#8211;CH2Ar to form a C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and quaternary center, ultimately producing valuable fluoroalkyl thioethers. Isotopic labeling experiments corroborate a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event within the working mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of [n]Cycloparaphenylene Ketone (n&#160;=&#160;6, 7, 8, and 10)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[n]Cycloparaphenylene ketone 4, [n]CPP&#8208;CO (n&#160;=&#160;6, 7, 8, 10) was synthesized. Because of the elevation of the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbital energies by the CPP units in 4, HOMO in 4 is the conjugated &#960;&#8208;system instead of the n&#8208;orbital. As a result, 4 exhibits photophysical properties that significantly differ from typical ketones; the lowest excited state of 4 is an S1 state with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* character, leading to fluorescing but not phosphorescing.








Abstract
[n]Cycloparaphenylene ketone 4, [n]CPP&#8208;CO, in which a carbonyl group is inserted into [n]CPP framework, with n&#160;=&#160;6, 7, 8, and 10, was synthesized by a coupling reaction between a CPP precursor and a ketone unit, followed by reductive aromatization. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed their M&#246;bius topology and significant molecular strain as characterized by the deviations in bond angles at the carbonyl carbon. The strain was also evidenced by size&#8208;dependent 20&#8211;50 cm&#8722;1 shifts in the carbonyl IR stretching bands. The CPP units in 4 significantly alter the electronic properties, particularly the relative orbital energies. Due to the elevation of the energy level of the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals by CPP units, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in 4 is the conjugated &#960;&#8208;system, in contrast to benzophenone, where the HOMO is the non&#8208;bonding n&#8208;orbital. Consequently, the lowest excited state of 4 is the singlet state (S1) with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* character rather than the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* triplet (T1) state. Furthermore, intersystem crossing from the S1 state to the T1 state, which is a characteristic process for typical aromatic ketones, does not occur efficiently. As a result, 4 exhibits unique photophysical properties opposite to those of typical aromatic ketones, such as fluorescing but not phosphorescing. Furthermore, the S1 state of 4 was quenched by molecular oxygen, most likely by the energy exchange mechanism. Optical and electrochemical properties showed a clear dependence on ring size, with smaller rings exhibiting greater strain, lower oxidation potentials, and red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission. These findings highlight the unique interplay between molecular topology, strain, and photophysics in CPP&#8208;based ketones and provide a foundation for designing novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials with tailored excited&#8208;state properties.

As a result, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibits photophysical properties that significantly differ from typical ketones; the lowest excited state of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is an S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* character, leading to fluorescing but not phosphorescing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]Cycloparaphenylene ketone &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]CPP-CO, in which a carbonyl group is inserted into [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]CPP framework, with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;6, 7, 8, and 10, was synthesized by a coupling reaction between a CPP precursor and a ketone unit, followed by reductive aromatization. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed their M&#246;bius topology and significant molecular strain as characterized by the deviations in bond angles at the carbonyl carbon. The strain was also evidenced by size-dependent 20&#8211;50 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; shifts in the carbonyl IR stretching bands. The CPP units in &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; significantly alter the electronic properties, particularly the relative orbital energies. Due to the elevation of the energy level of the occupied &#960;-orbitals by CPP units, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is the conjugated &#960;-system, in contrast to benzophenone, where the HOMO is the non-bonding n-orbital. Consequently, the lowest excited state of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is the singlet state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) with &#960;&#8211;&#960;* character rather than the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) state. Furthermore, intersystem crossing from the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state to the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state, which is a characteristic process for typical aromatic ketones, does not occur efficiently. As a result, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibits unique photophysical properties opposite to those of typical aromatic ketones, such as fluorescing but not phosphorescing. Furthermore, the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; was quenched by molecular oxygen, most likely by the energy exchange mechanism. Optical and electrochemical properties showed a clear dependence on ring size, with smaller rings exhibiting greater strain, lower oxidation potentials, and red-shifted absorption and emission. These findings highlight the unique interplay between molecular topology, strain, and photophysics in CPP-based ketones and provide a foundation for designing novel &#960;-conjugated materials with tailored excited-state properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of a Linear Tetraboron Cation via Deprotonation of a Nonsupported Dimeric Hydroborylborenium Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonation of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion results in formation of a linear tetraboron cation. This homocatenated boron species can activate H2, leading to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. 








Abstract
The nonsupported B&#8211;H&#8211;B moiety of a dimeric hydroborylborenium ion can be readily deprotonated by 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, affording a H&#8208;bridged linear tetraboron cation. The resulting tetraboron cation shows diverse reactivity with small molecules. Treatment of this tetraboron cation with H2 leads to the first example of complete hydrogenolysis of main&#8208;group homocatenated chains. On the other hand, in the presence of tBuNC, only the internal B&#8211;B bond of the tetraboron cation is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an azadiborabutadiene cation. Additionally, during the preparation of the hydroborylborenium, an unprecedented formal boryl cage&#8208;walking was observed. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this process involves consecutive activation of carboranyl B(9)&#8211;H bonds.

         <title>Sequential Reconstruction of Calicheamicin &#947;1I Iodo&#8208;Thiobenzoate by Selective Carrier Protein Trapping Reveals a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Iodinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic synthesis of the iodo&#8208;thiobenzoate of calicheamicin &#947;1I was reconstituted in vitro from malonyl&#8208;CoA, involving the orsellinate biosynthesis by CalO5 and subsequent modifications by CalO6, CalO3, CalO2, and CalO1. A TEV site was introduced into CalO5, enabling the successful detection of the intermediate or product attached to the ACP domain through intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometric analysis.








Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) play important roles in natural product biosynthesis, particularly chlorinases and brominases. Apart from ubiquitous mammalian iodination in thyroxine biosynthesis, iodinated natural products are extremely rare, and enzymes responsible for iodination are even less well described. A notable exception is calicheamicin &#947;1I, a potent antitumor compound containing an aromatic iodide, for which a halogenase has been proposed to mediate iodine incorporation. Despite predictions regarding the enzymes involved in iodinated aryl ring biosynthesis, experimental evidence remains limited due to challenges in substrate identification and reaction monitoring. In this study, we successfully reconstituted the enzymatic activities required for iodination and all embellishments of the highly substituted benzene ring in calicheamicin &#947;1I. Using intact&#8208;protein mass spectrometry combined with protease cleavage, we demonstrated formation of the orsellinate thioester followed by sequential C&#8208;2 O&#8208;methylation, C&#8208;5 iodination, C&#8208;3 oxidation, and C&#8208;3 O&#8208;methylation. This research characterizes the first flavin&#8208;dependent iodinase that acts on a carrier protein&#8208;dependent substrate, identifies the natural substrates of a cytochrome P450 oxygenase and two O&#8208;methyltransferases, and provides valuable insights for biocatalysis. Additionally, these findings could facilitate the engineering of other polyketide biosynthetic pathways and contribute to optimizing fermentation conditions to generate new calicheamicin derivatives.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting of Flexible Covalent Organic Pillars for Adaptive Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible covalent organic pillars (flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n) are adaptive nanotubular hosts formed via dynamic imine condensation. Their self&#8208;assembly displays an odd&#8211;even effect, yielding enantiomeric or meso duplexes. Host&#8211;guest studies reveal binding modes shaped by mutual deformation and geometric complementarity, underscoring their capacity for responsive molecular recognition. 








Abstract
Flexible covalent organic pillars (flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n) are introduced as a family of dual&#8208;open&#8208;ended nanotubular hosts constructed via dynamic imine condensation between pillararene&#8208;derived macrocyclic building blocks and conformationally mobile &#9472;(CH2)n&#9472; aliphatic linkers. These discrete molecular containers feature well&#8208;defined tubular channels capable of adaptive host&#8211;guest interactions. The self&#8208;assembly process exhibits a pronounced odd&#8211;even effect, yielding either enantiomeric or meso duplexes through distinct chiral self&#8208;sorting pathways. Host&#8211;guest interactions between flex&#8208;COP&#8208;4 and a series of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dibromoalkanes were systematically investigated using NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The resulting inclusion complexes span a continuum of binding modes&#8212;from relaxed encapsulation to strained, overpacked assemblies&#8212;governed by geometric complementarity and mutual host&#8211;guest deformation. These findings highlight the role of conformational flexibility in modulating molecular recognition under nanoscale confinement and establish flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n as a dynamic platform for mimicking adaptive features of biological receptors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable Poly(ionic liquid) Copolymers Driven by Polar and Dipolar Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation&#8211;anion moieties in poly(ionic liquid) copolymers can modify the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions. Precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing, thus opening pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy harvesting and storage, sensing, actuators, and others. 








Abstract
Commodity aliphatic and aromatic acrylic&#8208;based copolymers self&#8208;heal due to ubiquitous key&#8208;and&#8208;lock, ring&#8208;and&#8208;lock, and fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock van der Waals (vdW) interactions. However, the role of these interactions in the presence of covalently copolymerized ionic liquid (IL) is not known. This study is driven by the hypothesis that covalently incorporated cation&#8211;anion pairs to form poly(ionic liquid) copolymers (PILCs) can perturb inter&#8208; or intra&#8208;chain vdW interactions reflected in mechanical and electrical responses. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a series of PILCs comprising of pentafluorostyrene (PFS) and imidazolium&#8208;based IL monomers with variable&#8208;length aliphatic tails (methyl and butyl). Using a combination of 2D 1H&#8208;1H and 19F &#8208;19F NOESY NMR and FTIR measurements supplemented by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, these studies demonstrate that preferentially alternating/random PILCs topologies facilitate self&#8208;healing. The introduction of cation&#8211;anion moieties modifies the fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock interactions and, along with longer aliphatic tails &#9472;(CH2)3CH3 covalently attached to the imidazolium cation, enhances cation&#8208;anion mobility, thus faster recovery from mechanical damage occurs. These findings underline how precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self&#8208;healing in PILCs. These insights may open pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy storage and energy harvesting.

Using a combination of 2D &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F -&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NOESY NMR and FTIR measurements supplemented by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, these studies demonstrate that preferentially alternating/random PILCs topologies facilitate self-healing. The introduction of cation&#8211;anion moieties modifies the &lt;i&gt;fluorophilic-&#963;-lock&lt;/i&gt; interactions and, along with longer aliphatic tails &#9472;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; covalently attached to the imidazolium cation, enhances cation-anion mobility, thus faster recovery from mechanical damage occurs. These findings underline how precise control over dipolar and ionic interactions through copolymer composition enables self-healing in PILCs. These insights may open pathways for designing sustainable, mechanically resilient materials for applications in energy storage and energy harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Si&#9472;O Molecular Engineering Enhances Cathode&#8208;Anode Interface Stability for High&#8208;Loading and High&#8208;Voltage Layered Cathode&#8208;Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose PFOTMS as an interfacial stabilizer, leveraging the Si&#9472;O bond conjugation and steric hindrance of long fluorinated chains to form a weakly coordinated structure that selectively excludes solvents. This structure preferentially oxidizes to generate a F and Si&#9472;O rich interface layer, stabilizing the cathode and anode, and mitigating crosstalk effects from severe solvent decomposition and transition metal migration under high&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;load conditions.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered cathodes and lithium metal anode are promising for the next generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induces structural degradation and battery failure under high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;loading conditions. Herein, we report a fluorosilane&#8208;coupled electrolyte stabilizer with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H&#8208;perfluorooctyltrimethoxysilane (PFOTMS), which presents higher adsorption energy with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode than solvents through the conjugation of Si&#9472;O bonds and therefore is oxidized on its surface to derive an interfacial layer rich in F and Si&#9472;O species. This architecture effectively stabilizes the cathode structure, suppresses transition metal migration, and promotes Li+ conduction and uniform deposition, which also suppresses the side reactions of electrolyte with both cathode and anode. This unique interfacial stabilization mechanism enables the Li||NCM811 battery to achieve a capacity retention rate of 80.8% after 600 cycles at 4.7&#160;V. The Li||LiCoO2 cell with a high mass loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a remarkably high&#8208;capacity retention of 92.79% after 500 cycles at 4.4&#160;V. This work proposes an interfacial stabilization that overcomes high&#8208;voltage limitations in practical nickel&#8208;rich cathode/lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Ligand and Target Discovery by Using &#946;&#8208;Nitrostyrene Electrophiles: Supporting Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene as a reversible covalent warhead for both target discovery and the construction of small&#8208;molecule degraders. Several ligandable proteins that modulate cell proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia were identified. This warhead effectively induced target protein degradation by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM28. These findings establish a rational design strategy for developing potent monvalent degraders with therapeutic potential. 








Abstract
Bioconjugation chemistry has been a powerful avenue in expanding the repertoire of druggable proteome, as well as in identifying new E3 ligases to support targeted protein degradation (TPD). However, a large fraction of proteome remains inaccessible with existing covalent probes. Herein, we incorporated various electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into styrene derivatives and identified &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene as a cysteine&#8208;targeting reversible covalent warhead for target discovery. Through phenotypic screening and chemoproteomics platforms, we identified new ligandable sites such as C96 of SND1, C110 of PTGES2, modulating cell proliferation in an acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Moreover, incorporation of this warhead into the BRD4 inhibitor (+)&#8208;JQ1 demonstrated that the covalent handle engages the novel E3 ligase tripartite motif&#8208;containing 28 (TRIM28) at Cys232 residue, thereby promoting the targeted degradation. Notably, when transplanted into other protein&#8208;targeting ligands, the &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene warhead effectively induced protein degradation of EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S, PDE5, BTK, LRRK2, and BCR&#8208;ABL/c&#8208;ABL without eliciting a hook effect. Importantly, the degraders demonstrate significantly enhanced antcancer effects compared to corresponding inhibitors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of small&#8208;molecular degraders engaging TRIM28 to support targeted protein degradation, and provides a rational pathway for design and development of potent monovalent degraders.

         <title>Engineering Unspecific Peroxygenases for Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unspecific peroxygenase from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) has been successfully engineered to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. This biocatalytic process demonstrates high efficiency and selectivity with scalability to preparative levels, expanding the catalytic repertoire and synthetic applicability of UPOs in selective oxyfunctionalization.








Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization. Compared to cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), the catalytic potential of UPOs has been less investigated, largely due to their limited natural diversity and the challenges associated with their optimization through enzyme engineering. In this study, we engineered an UPO from Aspergillus niger (AniUPO) to catalyze the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, a valuable transformation yet to be realized in biocatalysis. Through enzyme engineering, two AniUPO variants, AniUPO&#8208;M3 and AniUPO&#8208;M6, were developed to produce a wide range of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters, achieving up to 97% yield, 4140 total turnover number (TTN), and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio (er). The biocatalytic process operates under mild conditions and is scalable for preparative applications. This study broadens the catalytic repertoire of UPOs and enhances their potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Alkylidene Succinimides Enabled by Weak Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positive correlation between weak noncovalent interactions and the activity of asymmetric hydrogenation was explored through both DFT calculations and experimental studies by modifying the protecting group of the substrate. Based on these findings, an Earth&#8208;abundant nickel catalytic system was developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylene succinimide, demonstrating superior efficiency (4000&#160;S/C, substrate/catalyst) compared to rare metal catalysts (2000&#160;S/C). This system delivered excellent results, achieving up to 99% enantiomeric excess (ee) and 99% yield.








Abstract
The development of asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts based on Earth&#8208;abundant metals presents a sustainable alternative to efficient but resource&#8208;limited rare&#8208;metal systems. However, these catalysts often suffer from low catalytic activity. In this study, through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic experiments, we uncovered a positive correlation between catalyst&#8208;substrate weak noncovalent interactions and catalytic efficiency in the enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides with different N&#8208;protecting groups. The tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) substituent emerged as the optimal choice, significantly enhancing reactivity. This approach enabled the hydrogenation of a wide range of substrates with excellent yields (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99%&#160;ee), achieving a substrate/catalyst (S/C) ratio of 4000&#8212;twice the efficiency of rare&#8208;metal catalysts (S/C&#160;&#8804;&#160;2000) for similar transformations. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the enantiomers revealed that the high stereoselectivity is promoted by stabilizing weak noncovalent interactions in the R&#8208;configured transition state.

         <title>Atomic Heterointerface Engineering and Nonequilibrium Carrier Dynamics for Enhanced Photocatalysis in Halide Perovskite/MoS2 Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface engineering of FAPbBr3 enables atomically&#8208;bridged ultrafast charge transport channels at FAPbBr3/MoS2 heterointerfaces, significantly enhancing charge separation efficiency from 29% to 63% and achieving a 100&#8208;fold improvement in photocatalytic activity. Unlike conventional Type&#8208;II and S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, the interfacial charge transfer is driven by a nonequilibrium charge transfer generated through charge density gradients.








Abstract
Halide perovskites hold promise for solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis in fuel production owing to their superior light absorption and carrier diffusion. However, precise control and understanding of interfacial charge separation dynamics in their heterostructures remain challenging. Using formamidinium lead bromide/molybdenum disulfide (FAPbBr3/MoS2) as a model, we engineered Pb&#8208;rich, Pb&#8208;neutral, and Pb&#8208;deficient surfaces via precursor stoichiometry tuning, modulating interface coupling through Pb&#9472;S bonds. High&#8208;density atomic bridging in Pb&#8208;rich interfaces boosts photogenerated charge separation efficiency from 29% to 63%, yielding a 98&#8208;fold hydrogen production increase and record 8.69% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the long carrier diffusion length and high photogenerated charge density of perovskites create a steep charge density gradient at the interface. This gradient directly induces a nonequilibrium internal electric field, which governs the charge transport dynamics. This work demonstrates the feasibility of sophisticated heterointerface tailoring and advances the understanding of the driving forces behind interfacial charge separation for perovskite photocatalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells via Chloramine Hydrochloride Molecular Bridges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, 2&#8208;Chloroethylamine Hydrochloride (CEA), Bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)amine Hydrochloride (BCEA), and Tris(2&#8208;Chloroethyl)Amine Hydrochloride (TCEA) act as bifunctional molecular bridges to simultaneously passivate defects at both SnO2 and perovskite interfaces while controlling crystallization. TCEA accelerates &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 formation, promotes grain size, and minimizes grain boundary defects. This improves electron extraction efficiency, prolongs hot&#8208;carrier cooling, and achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.25%, with a PCE retention rate of 90% after 1000 h.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require synergistic passivation strategies to address defects at the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface, impacting both efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. This study introduces chloramine hydrochlorides (CAHs) &#8211; 2&#8208;Chloroethylamine Hydrochloride (CEA), Bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)amine Hydrochloride (BCEA), and Tris(2&#8208;Chloroethyl)Amine Hydrochloride (TCEA) &#8211; as bifunctional molecular bridges to simultaneously passivate defects at both ETL (SnO2) and perovskite interfaces while controlling crystallization. Density functional theory calculations showed that TCEA forms strong Sn&#9472;Cl bonds, enhancing Sn&#8308;+ coordination. In situ characterization revealed that TCEA accelerated perovskite formation, suppressed PbI2, and promoted larger grains, thus minimizing grain boundary defects. This leads to an improved electron extraction efficiency, prolonged hot&#8208;carrier cooling, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.25% (compared to 23.64% for controls), with negligible hysteresis and 90% PCE retention after 1000&#160;h under ambient conditions. This study establishes a universal molecular design strategy for dual&#8208;interface engineering in high&#8208;efficiency and stable PSCs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence from Isolated Molecules Through Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence films were achieved by doping heterocyclic molecules containing a chiral propionic acid group into a polymer matrix, with the highest phosphorescence efficiency reaching up to 68.4% under ambient conditions. Notably, the chiral propionic acid group not only imparts circular polarization to the emitter but also enhances intermolecular interactions between the host and emitter.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with circularly polarization feature attracts considerable attentions owing to its unique exciton and photon properties. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a series of CPP films by doping heterocyclic molecules with a chiral propionic acid group into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, achieving a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 68.4% under ambient conditions. The intermolecular interactions between the chiral isolated molecules and PVA simultaneously induce circularly polarized luminescence and enhance phosphorescence efficiency, thereby improving CPP performance. Moreover, the CPP lifetimes of the films can be rationally tuned from 1 to 944&#160;ms by subtle modification of heteroatoms on the heterocyclic chromophores. This study provides a promising approach to developing efficient CPP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics and bioelectronics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D COFs)&#160;was developed with a cyt topology, facilitating the uniform dispersion and full exposure of distinct metal sites. The resulting TAPP&#8208;OFPc&#8208;COFs demonstrate exceptional electrocatalytic performance in urea oxidation. The Fe&#8211;Ni bimetallic sites synergistically ensure high efficiency and cycle stability.








Abstract
Porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile scaffolds for developing high&#8208;performance photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts. By enabling precise anchoring of metal species onto their cores, these COFs allow for meticulous tuning of chemical and electronic properties, facilitating single&#8208;atom distribution and achieving outstanding catalytic performance. However, the majority of these COFs are restricted to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures, where the catalytic activity of the metal centers is often compromised due to eclipsed stacking layers, limiting their optimization potential. To address this challenge, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porphyrin and phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with a cyt topology. This innovative structural arrangement facilitates the atomic&#8208;level distribution of distinct metal species across steric exposed networks, and the synergistic effect of bimetallic sites leads to exceptional electrocatalytic activity in urea oxidation reactions with a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at just 1.37&#160;VRHE. This study not only broadens the topological diversity of 3D COFs but also establishes a platform for achieving uniform and accessible multimetal distributions, paving the way for synergistic electrocatalytic materials.

         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;driven photochemistry has advanced significantly, offering diverse methodologies in synthetic organic chemistry. Photocatalysis using red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is particularly notable due to its lower energy, reduced phototoxicity, minimized side reactions, and deeper penetration into reaction media. This minireview summarizes recent developments in red&#8208; and NIR&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, emphasizing radical generation and reactive intermediates for organic synthesis. Applications in small&#8208;molecule activation, polymer chemistry, and biologically relevant transformations are discussed, highlighting the growing potential of these photochemical processes in fundamental and applied chemistry.








Abstract
The field of visible light&#8208;mediated photochemistry has experienced significant growth, leading to the development of a wide array of methodologies in synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, photocatalysis by using long&#8208;wavelength light such as red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light has garnered substantial attention. These strategies have inherent benefits of low energy, including minimal health hazards, less side reactions, and increased penetration through diverse reaction media. In this minireview, we present an overview of recent advancements in red&#8208; and NIR light&#8208;induced photocatalysis for the generation of various radicals and key intermediates in organic synthesis. Additionally, this minireview will recount the application of small&#8208;molecule activation, polymer science, and bio&#8208;related aspects to offer a comprehensive framework and insight of photochemistry mediated by red and NIR light.

         <title>A Dual Cofactor Co&#8208;Decorated Covalent Organic Framework as an Electron Transfer Regulator for Biomimetic Dioxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking the synergy of multiple active sites of oxygenase to achieve selective O2 activation for various oxidation is a very challenging but meaningful task. By introducing the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide active site dihydropyridine amido (DHPA) moiety and heme, a dual cofactor co&#8208;decorated covalent organic framework (COF) was obtained to duplicate the synergistically catalytic function of the cytochrome P450 for biomimetic O2 activation. Covalent co&#8208;decoration of dual cofactors in COFs ensures the rapid photogenerated electron&#160;transfer from DHPA to heme FeIII to generate FeII, selectively activating O2 to form FeIII&#8722;O2&#8226;&#8722; resembling the cytochrome P450 for improving the efficiency and selectivity of alcohol oxidation, avoiding conventionally complex multistep cofactor shuttling and regeneration. Control experiments of a COF analogue containing heme but not DHPA suggested that this dual cofactor construction strategy renders COFs the excellent activity and&#160; selectivity for O2 activation. As far as we know, this represents the first case of introducing dual cofactor into COFs to echo the cytochrome P450. The well&#8208;defined structural characters and the fine&#8208;modified bioactive properties open a new avenue to develop novel COFs, which not only augments the diversity of the COFs family but also broadens the application of COFs in the field of biomimetic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Energy Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion Through Anion Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanol, with its high market value and stable global demand, stands out as an attractive product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, achieving high ethanol selectivity and energy efficiency at industrial current densities remains challenging. In this study, we employed a blended anion modulation strategy to enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion. The Cu2(OH)3F pre&#8208;catalyst achieved faraday efficiencies of 50% and 93% for ethanol and C2+, respectively, at 700 mA cm&#8722;2 in a blended electrolyte consisting of 2 M KOH and 1 M KCl. Comprehensive electrochemical tests, combined with in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis, revealed that chloride and hydroxide increased *CO coverage for efficient C&#8208;C coupling. Moreover, hydroxide stabilizes the *CHCOH intermediate through hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed hydroxide on the catalyst surface, while Cl synergistically enhances its reactivity by promoting water dissociation toward the ethanol pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategy for Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes: Regulated Active Groups Enable High Capacity and Voltage in Aqueous and Seawater Aluminium ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials demonstrate significant potential as electrodes for aqueous batteries, owing to their high theoretical capacity, structurally tunable frameworks, and sustainable material accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule organic electrode materials enable better active&#8208;site accessibility but remain challenged by the dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which deteriorates cycling stability, and poor conductivity due to limited conjugation. Here, we designed an organic small&#8208;molecule cathode material (DPPZ&#8208;CN) featuring functional pyridine, pyrazine, and cyano groups. Its highly conjugated fused N&#8208;heteroaromatic structure provides strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity, resulting in improved stability, capacity, and conductivity. The electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano group further modulates electron delocalization and molecular orbitals, enhancing electronic conductivity and operating voltage. Through combined theoretical and experimental studies, including operando synchrotron FT&#8208;IR, in situ Raman, ex situ XPS and 1H NMR, we demonstrate that DPPZ&#8208;CN facilitates efficient dual&#8208;cation storage (Al3+/H+), thereby reducing Al3+ cation repulsion and induced structural distortion. As a result, the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery exhibits outstanding capacity, a well&#8208;defined voltage plateau, and an extended lifespan in organic aluminum batteries with aqueous and seawater electrolytes, highlighting its potential for operation in challenging environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Chemical and Photochemical Stability for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest for their potential in photocatalytic solar fuel generation. However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused&#8208;heterocycle thiazole&#8208;linked COFs (TZ&#8208;COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction using chrysene&#8208;6,12&#8208;diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused&#8208;ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12 M HCl), strong base (12 M KOH and 1 M MeONa), reducing (1 M NaBH4) and oxidizing (1 M H2O2) agents, along with   superior  photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazole s introduce  new,  robust protonation sites  compared to commonly used imine  linkages, which  improve  the hydrophilicit y , expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework .  TZ&#8208;COF&#8208;17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Bromine Complexation and Kinetics: A Bisimidazole Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8208;Br Static Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8211;bromine (Zn&#8211;Br) static batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage, yet the practical application is hindered by the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off about bromine complexing agents (BCAs) between bromine complexation strength and redox kinetics. Herein, we report a rationally designed bisimidazolium salt, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;1&#8208;yl) butane dibromide ([bMImB]Br2), which features a symmetric molecular structure that reconciles this contradiction. [bMImB]Br2 demonstrates strong bromine affinity, stemming from its high atomic charge of N+ and low solubility&#8212;properties comparable to those of tetraalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts. Simultaneously, it retains low steric hindrance typical of monoimidazole compounds, thereby enabling fast electrode kinetics. As a result, Zn&#8211;Br batteries incorporating [bMImB]Br2 deliver a high specific energy of 116 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1, alongside an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.22% and energy efficiency (EE) of 89.35% at 10 mAh&#183;cm&#8722;2 (0.5 C) for over 150 cycles. Furthermore, the flexible pouch cell maintains a discharge capacity of 110 mAh and 99.7% CE over 100 cycles, even under mechanical deformation. This work offers a generalizable molecular design strategy for developing next&#8208;generation BCAs in halogen&#8208;based energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Homologous Ladder Cyclohexasilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of five new examples of ladder cyclohexasilanes, possessing up to three consecutive fused rings. The synthesis of ladder compounds is challenging for both organic and inorganic skeletons, but Si&#8217;s tetrahedral geometry introduces the problem of diastereoisomerism: with each additional ring, the number of possible stereoisomers differing only in relative configuration at the ring fusion increases. By coupling a 1,4&#8208;dipotassiooligosilyl dianion to a central cyclohexasilane, we report the isolation of three of the five possible diastereomers of the ladder tricyclohexasilane. Combined experimental and theoretical studies suggest a kinetic selectivity for the cis diastereomer and a thermodynamic preference for the trans diastereomer that is also dependent on the structure of the dianion. Computational studies show that with each additional ring in the trans&#8208;diastereomeric series, the predicted onset of light absorption shifts to longer wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Derived Polyanionic Crosslinked Gel Interfacial Layer with Ion&#8208;Sieving and Ion&#8208;Regulating Capabilities for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sever side reactions and rampant dendrite growth on the zinc (Zn) electrode significantly hinder the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs).  Herein, we fabricate a multifunctional interfacial layer composed of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and  polyanionic gel featuring ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capabilities that effectively protects the Zn anode. The abundant &#8208;SO3&#8208; groups in polyanionic gel optimize the Zn2+ solvent sheath structure and simultaneously possess ion&#8208;sieving function, which significantly facilitate Zn2+ migration.The lignin derivatives pre&#8208;adsorb onto the Zn anode surface, guiding nucleation along the Zn (002) plane and providing electrostatic shielding effects to facilitate uniform Zn2+ deposition. In addition, polyanionic gel inhibits water activity by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water, while the PVDF layer adjacent to Zn electrode side significantly reduces the free water&#8208;induced side reactions. Consequently, the Zn electrodes with this protective layer demonstrated stable and efficient deposition/stripping behavior over a wide range of current densities. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells demonstrate remarkable cycling stability, maintaining the capacity of 176.1 mAh g&#8208;1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1 and 101.2 mAh g&#8208;1 after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1. This innovative strategy offers a promising approach to develop high&#8208;performance AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored in Metal Borides Enable Hydrogen Spillover for&#160;Superior Electrochemical Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of nitrate represents a promising and sustainable route for valuable ammonia generation. However, a vital challenge in the nitrate reduction reaction is an insufficient supply of active hydrogen (*H) and slow kinetics at a low working potential, which results in low production efficiency and high energy consumption. Here, we report the single&#8208;atom Ru decorated nanoporous metal borides as a high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalyst utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. Notably, the RuSA/np&#8208;Ni3B exhibits a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.2%, a NH3 yield of 30.4 mg h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1, and an energy efficiency of 39.1% at &#8208;0.1 V vs. RHE. In situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;atom Ru anchored in nanoporous Ni3B not only can efficiently dissociate water into *H and simultaneously promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface, but also can optimize surface states of Ni3B active centers, which synergistically reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer integrating nitrate reduction reaction with furfuryl alcohol oxidation reaction achieves current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;1.72 V with 100 h stability, improving the energy efficiency and economy of the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor Electrosynthesis from Low&#8208;Concentration NO via Carbon&#8208;Enhanced NO Adsorption and Improved Mass Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration NO is important but suffers from low Faraday efficiency and current density because of severe competitive hydrogen and ammonia evolution reactions. Here, porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies reveal that porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing ammonia and hydrogen formation. This work paves the way for accessing low&#8208;concentration gaseous reactants for various catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Responsive RNA Release Through Structural Optimization of Disulfide&#8208;Containing Acyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical methods for modifying and manipulating RNA are crucial for advancing its biological studies and applications. While post&#8208;synthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation has enabled on&#8208;demand RNA activation, its application to larger, biologically relevant RNAs remains challenging. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;responsive RNA modification via post&#8208;synthetic acylation to functionalize RNAs. Three strategies were developed to introduce multiple disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts at 2&#8217;&#8208;OH positions, temporarily blocking RNA function. Exposure to glutathione (GSH) can trigger the traceless release of RNA and restore its biological function. We demonstrate the versatility of this redox&#8208;responsive strategy with RNA constructs of varying lengths, including short synthetic RNA, single guide RNA (sgRNA) as well as longer messenger RNA (mRNA). Furthermore, these disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts respond to endogenous GSH, restoring mRNA translation without the need for cytotoxic exogenous stimuli. Taken together, these results offer a simple and generalizable method for modifying and modulating RNAs regardless of length or origin through structural optimization of acyl groups for facilitating RNA release, setting the stage for broad applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bioinspired Diazafluorenone Catalytic System for Aerobic Oxidative Deamination of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper amine oxidases catalyzed aerobic oxidation of primary amines into carbonyl compounds is an important biological process, as well as a useful transformation for organic synthesis. A new bioinspired organocatalyst, 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), has been discovered, which exhibits impressive characteristics including simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity, enabling it to effectively mimic the function of copper amine oxidases. Oxidative deamination of &#945;&#8208;amino amides presents an attractive approach to access &#945;&#8208;keto amides, however, it is difficult to achieve due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric effect. The diazafluorenone displays high catalytic activity in this transformation, producing various biologically significant &#945;&#8208;keto amides in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the diazafluorenone catalyst is able to promote direct oxidation of benzylamines into aromatic aldehydes, instead of the generally formed product&#8208;reactant imines, which leads to not greater than 50% yields of the desired aldehydes. The current aerobic oxidative deamination proceeds via a pathway similar to the biological process, involving transamination, hydrolysis/aminolysis, and aerobic oxidation.</dc:description>

Herein we show that the reaction of diamidophosphate (DAP) with the four pentoses &#8208; ribose, arabinose, xylose and lyxose &#8208; naturally selects the ribofuranose form more efficiently when compared to the other three pentoses. All four pentoses form the initial diamidophosphate&#8208;adduct &#8211; however, ribose undergoes rapid conversion to ribofuranose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while the other three pentoses show significant accumulation of the initially formed DAP&#8208;adducts and slow conversion to the cyclicphosphate products. Arabinose and xylose show a distribution between furanose&#8208;, and pyranose&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while lyxose forms the furanose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and &#8208;pyranose&#8208;2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products. This trend is also manifested when starting from a mixture of pentoses where ribofuranose 1,2&#8208;amidocyclicphosphate dominates the product distribution. Such selection for ribofuranose among pentoses by phosphorylation (a) provides another venue of how a ribofuranose&#8208;structure can selectively emerge through abiotic chemical reaction suitable for elaboration towards RNA and (b) adds to the body of experimental work addressing the chemical origin of RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons. We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65 nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550 nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A 'Cocktail' Fluorescent Probe for Multi&#8208;ROS Imaging Unveils Ferroptosis&#8208;Driven Liver Fibrosis Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liver fibrosis is a pathological repair response triggered by chronic liver injury. Without treatment, it may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing to high mortality rates. To date, no approved therapies specifically target advanced liver fibrosis, thus exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis has become crucial. Previous studies have highlighted significant controversy regarding the role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis. Given that ROS serve as key mediators in both ferroptosis and liver fibrosis, ROS may serve as a molecular nexus connecting ferroptosis and liver fibrosis. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular network involving ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, we designed and synthesized the first multi&#8208;functional 'cocktail' fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, enabling highly sensitive and selective simultaneous imaging of O2&#8226;&#8211;, H2O2 and ONOO&#8722;. FP&#8208;ROS was successfully employed to assess ferroptosis levels in the livers of fibrosis mice following drug intervention. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we elucidated the signaling pathway NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a critical role in HSCs activation and further elucidates the molecular interplay between ROS and ferroptosis in fibrosis progression. These findings provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin PtSe2 Nanowires in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum selenide (PtSe2) has shown great potential for application in electrocatalysis. One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures are particularly advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance, as they expose abundant active sites at the edges and enable rapid charge transport. However, the synthesis of 1D PtSe2 nanostructures for efficient electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of ultrathin (0.4&#8208;2.0 nm) PtSe2 nanowires (NWs) using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a confined template via direct selenization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The atom&#8208;resolved electron microscope combined with spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, possessing zigzag edges and higher thermodynamical stability. Owing to the rich&#8208;edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684 wt%, with an overpotential of 47 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7 mV dec&#8208;1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low&#8208;cost and efficient Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the future.</dc:description>

However, due to the very limited synthetic methods, the enormous potential of N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds has not yet been unlocked. In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. Additionally, the reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sila&#8208;Cycloaddition of Dichlorodisilanes: Selective Si&#8211;Cl Activation for Cyclic Disilanes and Enantioenriched Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4+2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. This transformation proceeds under mild, reductive nickel catalysis via an unusual Si&#8211;Cl bond activation pathway and accommodates a broad range of dienes, including bulk feedstocks, cyclic, multi&#8208;substituted, aliphatic, aromatic dienes, and trienes. An asymmetric variant further enables the efficient construction of chiral disilane frameworks with high enantioselectivity. The resulting disilacarbocycle adopts boat&#8208;like conformations, as revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis, due to the elongated Si&#8211;Si and Si&#8211;C bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that a triplet Ni0 species engages in an SN2&#8208;type oxidative addition to the Si&#8211;Cl bond, favoring this pathway over a concerted Si&#8211;Si activation. The resulting Si&#8211;Ni(I) intermediates are energetically preferred over Si&#8211;Ni(II) analogs in the subsequent diene insertion step.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of genetic code expansion and directed evolution has recently given rise to enantioselective photoenzymes for [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of quinolone and indole derivatives. However, the enzymes reported to date only allow access to one enantiomeric series of the strained cyclobutane products. Here, guided by a crystal structure of our previously engineered enzyme EnT1.3, we show how judicious repositioning of the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer affords an enantiocomplementary [2+2]&#8208;cyclase, CEnT1.0. Following directed evolution, a proficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzyme (CEnT1.4) emerged that promotes [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of a quinolone derivative with exquisite enantiocontrol (99% e.e.) and substantially enhanced regioselectivity compared with EnT1.3 (r.r. 62:1 vs 9:1). Structural analysis of CEnT1.4, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveal a well&#8208;sculpted active site pocket that pre&#8208;organises the substrate for regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalysis. This study highlights the versatility offered by genetically programmed (photo)catalytic elements when developing enzymes for altered stereochemical outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Activated Tumor&#8208;Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical molecular imaging with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe (termed MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS&#8208;responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high&#8208;contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (~3 mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3.8V Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery Enabled by a Conjugated Ladder Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries based on non&#8208;metal charge carriers like NH4+ recently have attracted intensive attention due to high safety, environmental friendliness, low cost and fast kinetics. However, NH4+ electrolytes suffer from a narrow electrochemical potential window, making it challenging to construct high&#8208;voltage and energy&#8208;dense devices. Here we report a quaternary ammonium (NR4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) working at a high voltage of 3.8V, which was enabled by a conjugated ladder polymer poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) anode for NR4+ storage and a graphite cathode for anion uptake. The BBL functions as an efficient NR4+ host by carbonyl/enol transformation, delivering a high capacity of 120 mAh/g, low average potential, high stability and excellent rate performance. In the redox process, the electronic and ionic conductivities of BBL change periodically, accompanied with the formation of radical anion (&#9679;&#8722;) and diradical dianion (2&#9679;&#8722;). In combination with an anion&#8208;intercalation graphite cathode, the assembled graphite//BBL DIB exhibits a maximum energy/power density up to 232 Wh/kg and 6865 W/kg based on mass of graphite, superior rate performance and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of NR4+ as cation carrier and its efficient host, which will inspire novel design for high&#8208;performance non&#8208;metallic energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>New Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Based on Covalent Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single&#8208;molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage&#8208;electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single&#8208;molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single&#8208;molecule conductance was found at 10&#8208;3.5 G&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well&#8208;defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.</dc:description>

         <title>From Corrosion to Creation: Interfacial De&#8208;electronation Drives Hydrogenation&#8208;Energy Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal corrosion, conventionally perceived as a destructive phenomenon driven by de&#8208;electronation, imposes significant economic burdens and safety hazards. To repurpose corrosion into a valuable resource, we demonstrate a macroscopic corrosion battery concept that harnesses galvanic corrosion to drive the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals and energy generation, challenging conventional corrosion mitigation paradigms. By spatially segregating corrosion process, the system couples anodic metal de&#8208;electronation with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) deposition, while integrating diverse cathodic reactions including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction, electrocatalytic hydrogenation, and hydrogen peroxide reduction with remarkable accelerated kinetics. The prototype system demonstrates concurrent production of p&#8208;aminophenol (14.3 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) and zinc oxalate (86.9 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) while generating 34.2 mW cm&#8208;2 of electrical power. Techno&#8208;economic analysis establishes the inaugural empirical validation of economic feasibility for corrosion&#8208;driven energy&#8208;matter symbiosis, highlighting its high gross profit. Transcending conventional corrosion engineering boundaries for inorganic synthesis, this methodology mechanistically deciphers MOF growth kinetics and advanced system design. By broadening the scope of corrosion utilization, this work enables a paradigm shift from damage mitigation to value creation, providing a blueprint for sustainable chemical&#8208;energy ecosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Power of Dark State Photocages: An Efficient Pathway to Triplet State under Near&#8208;Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocage platform provides a synergistic approach to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Before light activation, both pro&#8208;photosensitizers and pro&#8208;drugs remain inert, ensuring safety. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, they undergo photoactivation and controlled release in deep tissues. However, the low photolysis efficiency of conventional singlet&#8208;state photocages limits their in vivo applications, necessitating an exploration of how excited&#8208;state dynamics influence photolysis. In this study, we introduce the concept of a "dark state photocage" and establish a photocage platform responsive to NIR light by incorporating phenoxazine or phenothiazine groups. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the dark state enhances triplet&#8208;state formation and facilitates intersystem crossing, thereby promoting photolysis. These photocages achieve functional molecule release under low&#8208;power NIR light (15 mW&#183;cm&#8315;&#178;), with an efficiency of up to 90%. This advancement enables a sharp transition from an "OFF" to an "ON" tumor imaging signal and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer under NIR light irradiation, effectively integrating PDT and chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Acrylamide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via Mannich Polymerization for Efficient Gold Recovery from Complex E&#8208;waste Leachates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization involving 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene, Meldrum&#8217;s acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide&#8208;linked COFs (Tb&#8208;PD&#8208;M, Tb&#8208;ND&#8208;M, and Tb&#8208;AD&#8208;M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C=O and N&#8208;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, Tb&#8208;AD&#8208;M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a one-step Mannich-type three-component polymerization involving 1,3,5-triformylbenzene, Meldrum&#8217;s acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide-linked COFs (Tb-PD-M, Tb-ND-M, and Tb-AD-M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;-conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C=O and N-H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, Tb-AD-M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Differentiation of Homologous Anisodimensional Frameworks Driven by Site&#8208;Selective Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretically, distinguished from the dimensional isomers in reticular chemistry, structures with different dimensions can also be formed by site&#8208;selective polymerization using identical building blocks bearing a high density of reactive sites. Unfortunately, the spatial confinement imposes significant challenges for molecular building blocks to achieve dimensional differentiation via their intrinsic site&#8208;selective reactivity. In this work, we first report the dimensional transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) driven by site&#8208;selective polymerization of identical molecular building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. This unique phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time to originate from the role of aniline in enhancing the reversibility of the reaction system and modulating the conformational flexibility of the monomers. We systematically elucidated the mechanism underlying this dimensional transformation and successfully demonstrated the generality of the synthetic strategy. Moreover, the residual benzaldehyde in the frameworks generated via the site&#8208;selective polymerization of the building blocks can serve as exciton acceptors, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work not only offers a novel strategy for regulating the dimensionality of COFs, but also provides a valuable reference for precisely controlling the conformational flexibility of building blocks to enable topological transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Macrocycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Strategy for Interchangeable Screwdriver&#8208;Like On&#8208;Demand Post&#8208;Functionalization of Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post&#8208;functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time&#8208;consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs. Moreover, their functions are difficult to change once the functionalities are covalently attached to COF skeletons. Herein, we report a macrocycle&#8208;based supramolecular strategy for variable noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform like an interchangeable screwdriver. As a proof of concept, pillar[5]arene (P5A) with electron&#8208;rich cavity is incorporated into COF as macrocycle host to anchor different electron&#8208;deficient guests of various functions. Such a design allows tunable post&#8208;functionalization of COF through host&#8208;guest interactions for customized utilities, which has been demonstrated by using a series of guests including organic salts for iodine capture and cyano&#8208;based ligands for metal ion separation. Removing the guests enables recycling of COF, consecutive reinstallation of different guests, and continuous use for implementing expected tasks. This work establishes a general noncovalent approach to on&#8208;demand interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Cyanogen Vacancies in Prussian Blue for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB), recognized as a promising cathode material, has gained significant attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the influence of anion vacancies on the stability of the PB framework remains controversy, impeding a comprehensive grasp of their precise role in electrochemical performance and the controlled synthesis of PB with smaller unitary anionic vacancies remains challenging because of the limitations inherent in current synthesis strategy. Herein, we present an anion complexation method to synthesize PB materials with modulable cyanogen vacancy contents. Furthermore, we propose a vacancy&#8208;driven mechanism that promotes spin transitions coupled with lattice bending, which is more reversible at low&#8208;spin Fe sites, leading to excellent low&#8208;spin stability and the design of materials with outstanding electrochemical performance. This anion complexation method not only provides a novel synthetic pathway for PB materials but also advances the understanding of the composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships between cyanogen vacancy structures and spin transition mechanism, highlighting its potential for future energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Polyester Waste using Reconstructed Defective&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical recycling of polyester waste presents a promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular economy. However, the development of efficient, low&#8208;cost recycling methods that minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions remains challenging. Here, we report an approach for depolymerization polyester waste to bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) using a reconstructed metal&#8208;organic framework (r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT) catalyst under mild conditions. The r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT exhibited a space&#8208;time yield of 1035.8 gBHET gcat&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 at 190 &#186;C. Importantly, this is an order of magnitude higher than that reported for similar MOF&#8208;based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the depolymerization pathway involves the activation of oxygen and ethylene glycol adsorbed on r&#8208;Zn&#8211;MOF74&#8211;NT, forming nucleophilic intermediates. These intermediates then facilitate the cleavage of polyester C&#8211;O bond through nucleophilic attack, thereby gradually generating the BHET product. Sustainability evaluation results validated the circular economy feasibility of the recycling approach, with a minimum sales price (MSP) of 498 $/ton, much lower than the MSP of the traditional petroleum&#8208;based production route (1,000 $/ton). The approach also achieved a 61% reduction in energy use and a 52% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This work provides a sustainable solution for managing polyester waste accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of Retro&#8208;Isomeric Peptides for Tuning the Polymer Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidomimetic polymers containing hydrophobic amino acids and non&#8208;peptidic linkages are interesting for various applications, particularly hydrophobic coatings.

         <title>Solid&#8208;state NMR Reveals Reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cell Wall Due to a Host&#8208;Defence Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited availability of antifungal drug treatments and the rising issue of drug resistance highlight the urgent need for new antifungal drugs to combat drug&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The host&#8208;defence peptide cathelicidin&#8208;2 has demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on azole&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus but its mechanism of action remains elusive. We applied a tailored set 1H and 13C detected solid state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to elucidate the cell wall composition of Aspergillus fumigatus and to shed light on the mechanism of action of the peptide within the cell wall. Our results revealed that presence of the peptide affects galactosaminogalactan, an important component involved in the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, as well as other specific polysaccharides and amino acids within the mobile cell wall domain. At longer exposure times, the peptide also influences the rigid cell wall domains by enhancing water penetration into the hydrophobic rigid cell wall domain. The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.</dc:description>

Our results revealed that presence of the peptide affects galactosaminogalactan, an important component involved in the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, as well as other specific polysaccharides and amino acids within the mobile cell wall domain. At longer exposure times, the peptide also influences the rigid cell wall domains by enhancing water penetration into the hydrophobic rigid cell wall domain. The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Seeding, Acid Stalling, and Solidifying: Time&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Nonclassical Pathways in Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise analysis reveals a distinct formation pathway for UiO&#8208;66(Zr) gels, starting with heterogeneous nucleation by zirconium hydrolysis nanoparticles (Zr(OH)4) and followed by rapid crosslinking of amorphous clusters into a fractal network. Unlike classical metal&#8208;organic framework crystallization, this study explains how self&#8208;generated acid inhibits coordination, stabilizing complex frameworks in gel state with high ligand deficiency. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic gels (MOGs), an innovative subset of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), feature hierarchically porous architecture and self&#8208;shaping monolithic morphologies, demonstrating them significantly potential for advanced applications in catalysis, gas storage, and energy conversion. Despite their functional versatility, the synthesis of MOGs remains empirical, as the actual formation mechanisms are largely unexplored. Here, a multiscale characterization strategy integrating time&#8208;resolved in&#8208;situ small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), Zr K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) analyses are systematically employed to elucidate the formation mechanism of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) gel. The synthetic techniques provide a multidimensional perspective: (1) At the mesoscale, self&#8208;induced heterogeneous nucleation triggers a rapid evolution from linear prenucleation clusters to a 3D fractal network governed by autocatalytic hydrolysis of Zr precursors. (2) At the atomic level, the reorganization of Zr&#8211;oxo clusters and the substitution of coordinating H2O molecules and chloride ions with terephthalate ligands over prolonged timescales are uncovered. Crucially, in&#8208;situ generated acid&#8208;mediated coordination suppression emerges as a pivotal factor preventing the conversion of MOGs into their crystalline MOF counterparts. These findings highlight a nonclassical evolution pathways distinct from classical MOF crystallization, thereby providing a mechanistic foundation for tailoring MOGs with programmable morphological and structural attributes.

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (chevron&#8208;GNR and chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Cryptographic Key&#8208;Based Fluorescence Encryption Enabled by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing threats of data forgery and security breaches necessitate the development of advanced encryption strategies beyond traditional cryptographic methods. Fluorescence&#8208;based encryption has emerged as a promising alternative, yet current systems suffer from low security due to simple, reversible stimuli responses. Here, we introduce a novel lock&#8208;and&#8208;key encryption system using a chiral cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CDMOF), termed Zole@CDMOF (Zole = acetylated benzoimidazole), for enantioselective discrimination of phenylethylamine (PEA) enantiomers. In this framework, the confined Zole guest serves as the lock, while PEA enantiomers act as the key, selectively triggering fluorescence turn&#8208;on via acetyl&#8208;O bond cleavage and restoring excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of deacetylated Zole. Mechanistic studies reveal that enantioselectivity arises from thermodynamic differences and distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between PEA enantiomers. To enhance practical application, Zole@CDMOF is fabricated into a flexible sensor via a simple scotch tape strategy, enabling direct visual indexing of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, we propose a barcode&#8208;based chiral encryption model, establishing a quadruply encrypted system with ultra&#8208;high security&#8212;allowing only one out of approximately two million keys to unlock the data. This study pioneers the first chiral cryptographic key in fluorescence encryption, paving the way for ultra&#8208;secure encryption, advanced chiral sensing, and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Engineered Proton Transfer Pathways for Selective Pure Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SE) cells hold great promise for electrochemical synthesis of pure H2O2, yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR) in such systems, particularly when using pure water as the proton source, remain unclear. While both Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H&#8208;mediated) and Eley&#8208;Rideal (ER, water&#8208;derived proton&#8208;coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, their practical dominance under SE conditions has locked experimental validation. Herein, we designed a hierarchical Ni&#8208;N2&#8208;C&#8208;O single&#8208;atom/NiO nanocluster co&#8208;decorated porous carbon nanosheet catalyst (NiSA&#8208;NiO/pCNs) that achieved exceptional 2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR performance, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a H2O2 partial current density of 356 mA cm&#8722;2 (equivalent to 6.6 mmol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 production rate) in a membrane&#8208;free SE cell. Through detailed analysis of reaction intermediates and the local pH using in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect and density functional theory simulations, we demonstrated the critical role of NiO nanoclusters in tuning the protonation pathway: the water dissociation (WD) capability of NiO activates the ER mechanism via fast proton transfer from solvent water, whereas NiSA/pCNs without NiO preferentially follow the LH mechanism through surface&#8208;adsorbed *H intermediates from the interfacial transferred proton. These findings establish a catalyst design principle for controlling interfacial proton transfer routes in solid&#8208;state H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The Eley&#8208;Rideal (ER) mechanism is pivotal in heterogeneous catalysis processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, which rely heavily on the interaction between solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;phase species. In this study, we examine the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene to explore the factors influencing the ER mechanism. We employed the density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the hydrogenation of acetylene on face&#8208;centered cubic metals and copper&#8208;based alloys. Microkinetic modeling identifies changes in the rate&#8208;determining steps of different alloys as electronegativity decreases. We then constructed the volcano plot for the adsorption energy towards C2H2 and the reaction rate, which predicted that Cu3Au is the best candidate alloy for the C2H2 semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Both extensive prior research and our experimental findings validated our volcano plot. Notably, our work points out the two key determinants of the ER mechanism: atomic activation and steric hindrance. For metals with weaker adsorption, steric hindrance primarily obstructs the ER mechanism, while for metals with stronger adsorption, the ER mechanism is hindered due to the challenge of atomic activation. Therefore, introducing weak adsorption sites into moderately adsorptive metals can improve the overall efficiency of the ER reaction by balancing these two factors.</dc:description>

         <title>Blood Retention and Kidney Clearance of Renal&#8208;Clearable Gold NanoparticlesStrongly&#160; Correlate with Renal Injury Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are typically filtered through the glomeruli and transported along the renal tubules before entering the bladder. However, the effects of glomerular leakage and tubular injury, two common features of kidney diseases, on nanoparticle transport remains poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the blood retention, kidney accumulation, and renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; in a doxorubicin&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model. By correlating its transport with proteinuria and urinary kidney injury molecule&#8208;1 (KIM&#8208;1), endogenous biomarkers of glomerular leakage and proximal tubular injury, respectively, we found that glomerular leakage, as indicated by a &gt;50&#8208;fold increase in proteinuria, did not enhance its blood clearance. Instead, tubular injury significantly reduced glomerular filtration, resulting in elevated blood retention, increased kidney accumulation, and reduced renal clearance of Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328;. Moreover, Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; blood retention exhibited a very strong positive correlation with urinary KIM&#8208;1 (Pearson&#8217;s coefficient r = 0.90), much stronger than KIM&#8208;1 correlations with conventional glomerular filtration blood markers such as serum creatinine. This suggests that Au&#8322;&#8325;(SG)&#8321;&#8328; could serve as a sensitive exogenous blood marker of tubular injury, expanding the diagnostic potential of renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles in kidney diseases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 A g&#8208;1) at 25 &#8451;. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;20 &#8451; and 130.1 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;40 &#8451; at 0.2 A g&#8208;1). Even at &#8208;70 &#8451;, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8208; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.</dc:description>

Furthermore, PAF-310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low-temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g-1 at -20 &#8451; and 130.1 mAh g-1 at -40 &#8451; at 0.2 A g-1). Even at -70 &#8451;, PAF-310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1).

         <title>Regioselective C&#8208;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform = H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Developing dual&#8208;responsive ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) is crucial for achieving intelligent nanodevices. In their Research Article (e202507852), Haibao Jin and co&#8208;workers report an innovative strategy for fabricating pH/visible light dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with reversible acidochromism and fluorochromism performances via the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers. 2D Quick Response code was meticulously crafted through incorporating these fluorescent UTPSs inks into the patterning lithography, displaying a multi&#8208;level decryption activity.

         <title>Linking Metallacycle Transfer with Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis to Generate Polyacetylenes of Unprecedented Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unusual low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap polyacetylenes bearing ring&#8208;fused tellurophene and vinyl side chains were prepared by combining metallacycle transfer (Hf/p&#8208;block element exchange) with ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) into a single modular and efficient protocol. 








Abstract
A hafnium&#8208;based bicyclic precursor (COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Hf) has been prepared that enables tandem Hf/E metallacycle transfer (E&#160;=&#160;main group element) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclooctatetraene (COT) units to generate a new family of structurally unique polyacetylenes. Highlights from this work include a tellurophene&#8208;grafted polyacetylene, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;Te, and a polyacetylene with unsaturated vinyl side chains, poly&#8208;COT&#8208;2B&#8208;vinyl. The resulting polymers can be processed into films that yield optical band gaps as low as 1.6&#160;eV, representing promising new architectures for the optoelectronics community.

         <title>Hybrid Cathode Interlayer Engineering Enables Over 20% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is developed by using polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine as a guest material to improve the photovoltaic performance of the perylene&#8208;diimide cathode interlayer. Benefitted from the improved ohmic contact, interfacial compatibility, and carrier dynamics of PDINN:F16CuPc, a remarkable efficiency of 20.17% is achieved in the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device, which is higher than that of the control PDINN&#8208;based device with an efficiency of 19.29%.








Abstract
The capability of cathode interlayer (CIL) in regulating the conductivity, interfacial dipole, and work function of the electrode plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The widely used perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs suffered from the inbuilt limitation of finite conductivity and poor thickness tolerance. To address this issue, we develop a universal strategy to finely optimize the functionality of perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;type CIL (PDINN) by incorporating polyfluorine&#8208;substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) derivative to form a hybrid CIL. It is found that the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between PDINN and CuPc can address the solvent processability issue of CuPc used as CIL. The incorporation of CuPc in the PDINN layer leads to better film morphology, increased conductivity, and reduced cathode work function, enabling greater CIL thickness tolerance and significantly improved photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Notably, the PM6:D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device using PDINN:F16CuPc as hybrid CIL yields a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.17%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 19.29% for the control device based on PDINN CIL. Particularly, this strategy demonstrates a universality in multiple photoactive layers and various perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based CILs, offering an effective approach to developing highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Fortification of FeS Clusters Reshapes Anaerobic CO Dehydrogenase into an Air&#8208;Viable Enzyme through Multilayered Sealing of O2 Tunnels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered CO dehydrogenase (CODH) that remains active in air through a multilayered gas tunnel is illustrated on the cover. The architecture selectively blocks O2 while allowing CO/CO2 to access the FeS cluster, thereby maintaining redox balance and preventing oxidative destabilization. The visual contrast between inactive and active forms highlights the tunnel's protective role. This work offers a tunnel&#8208;guided strategy for engineering air&#8208;stable metalloenzymes with practical potential, as described by Suk Min Kim, Hyung Ho Lee, Yong Hwan Kim et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202508565)

An electron&#8208;rich tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen is developed by Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202504825) to enhance thermal conductivity in polymer composites through molecular&#8208;level interface engineering.

         <title>Coherently Coupled Frustrated Lewis Pairs in In2O3&#8722;x Nanoclusters for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) were constructed on the graphitic carbon nitride support, leveraging the privileged hydrogen&#8208;bond sewing interface. Significantly, the built&#8208;in electric fields and particularly multisite architecture reshape the kinetic landscapes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The downstream reduction follows the formate pathway, which preferentially inhibits CO production while promotes CH4 formation. 








Abstract
Co&#8208;catalysts integration presents unique opportunities to enhance photoactivity, yet selectivity control and mechanistic understanding within multistep reactions remain fundamental challenges hitherto. In this study, a reshaped kinetic landscape is demonstrated over coherently coupled surface frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on carbon nitride matrix, which mediates directed CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion with a selectivity of 65.3% (electron basis). The hydrogen&#8208;bonded interface fosters intimate electronic coupling, generating built&#8208;in electric fields that facilitate cascade charge transfer processes. Particularly, exceptionally robust FLPs sites were identified within the sub&#8208;nanosized In2O3&#8722;x nanoclusters, in contrast to easily deactivated counterparts in oversized crystalline structures. These enduring FLPs sites confer privileged adaptive binding with CO2 and mutative C1 intermediates. Correlated in situ infrared and mass spectroscopic analyses track the formation of FLPs&#8208;CO2 adducts and highlight the predominance of formate (HCOO&#8722;) pathway, surpassing competitive CO evolution. This work opens inspiring prospects for exploring multielectron photochemistry and achievable metrics through distinctive FLPs topologies on sub&#8208;nanostructures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Hole&#8208;Selective Molecules for UV&#8208;Resistant High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a thiophene&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayer, referred to as Me&#8208;TPCP, which serves as the hole&#8208;selective layer for inverted perovskite solar cells. Me&#8208;TPCP demonstrates exceptional ultraviolet stability, superior hole extraction, and effective defect passivation capabilities. Consequently, we achieve a remarkable efficiency of 25.62% with excellent ultraviolet, operational, and thermal stability.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced degradation, particularly occurring at the buried interface, has emerged as a significant stability challenge, severely limiting the widespread applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we rationally design and synthesize novel thiophene&#8208;modified self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated hole&#8208;selective molecules, namely (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;TPCP), affording UV&#8208;stable high&#8208;efficiency PSCs. Simultaneously incorporating phenyl and thiophene groups enhances molecular conjugation, effectively protecting the fragile bonds between the carbazole core and the phosphonic acid group. This modification results in enhanced intrinsic UV stability and improved hole transport ability of the molecule. Furthermore, thiophene grafted on the carbazole coordinates with the Pb2+ ions in perovskite, enhancing the binding of perovskite to hole&#8208;selective molecules. Consequently, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is significantly improved, along with decreased defect density, thereby inhibiting its degradation under UV light illumination. By introducing methyl groups, the molecular stability is further enhanced, and the energy level of Me&#8208;TPCP is finely tuned, resulting in a lower interfacial energy barrier that facilitates more efficient hole extraction. With these advantages, inverted PSC devices based on Me&#8208;TPCP achieve a significantly higher efficiency of 25.62% than the control devices (23.85%). Meanwhile, these devices demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in UV stability, as well as improved operational and thermal stability.

         <title>Engineering Crystalline/Amorphous Interfaces for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an amorphous indium&#8208;based catalyst, which could reconstruct into crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of metallic indium under working conditions. Therefore, it can exhibit excellent performance in CO2 electroreduction to formic acid at high current densities. The Faradaic efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to formic acid over the In/In&#9472;OH interfaces reaches 98%, which is a 66.1% increase compared to traditional In2O3. 








Abstract
In the request for carbon neutrality, CO2 electroreduction to high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals, particularly formic acid, has become as a promising approach. However, implementing it on an industrial scale is hindered by the catalyst instability under high current densities and the excessive energy consumption of conventional electrolysis systems. To tackle these challenges, we propose an amorphization strategy to regulate catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions. In particular, an amorphous In&#8208;based catalyst, InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x, was designed and achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 98% at &#8722;800 to &#8722;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction to formate, while maintaining stability for 100&#160;h. Mechanistic studies show that InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x undergoes partial reduction to stable crystalline/amorphous In/In&#9472;OH interfaces instead of fully reducing to metallic In, enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediate. To improve the economic viability of electrolysis system, a CO2 electroreduction coupled with waste plastics electrooxidation system for formate production was constructed. Compared to conventional electrolysis system, the coupled system reduced energy consumption by 34.7% and increased formate production by 49.7%, offering a more energy&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective approach to CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Decoupling Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation: A Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Assisted Dual&#8208;Site Synergy Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy mechanism is demonstrated to overcome the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru single sites drive selective CO&#8322;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, while Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply H species to Ru single sites via spillover over N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, achieving 98.0% CO selectivity with ultrahigh activity (3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The persistent trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity remains a critical barrier to efficient CO2 valorization. Herein, we propose a concept of decoupling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the photothermal catalytic reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by hydrogen spillover&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;site synergy. This concept is demonstrated through a hybrid catalyst constructed by immobilizing abundant Ru single sites and trace Ru clusters onto high&#8208;efficiency photothermal support of N&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages (hNCNC). Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#9472;N4 sites are highly active and selective for the RWGS reaction, contingent on the efficient migration of dissociated *H species to adjacent C atoms of Ru. Importantly, we experimentally confirm that Ru single sites dominate CO2 hydrogenation to CO, whereas Ru clusters facilitate H&#8322; activation and supply hydrogen species to adjacent single sites via spillover over hNCNC. Leveraging this synergistic interaction, the hybrid catalyst achieves an exceptional CO production rate of 3.1&#160;mol&#183;gRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity over 98%. This mechanism shows universal applicability as demonstrated by the effective promotion of CO2 hydrogenation of Ru single sites by other typical hydrogen&#8208;spillover&#8208;active metal clusters, e.g., Pt and Pd clusters. This design concept liberates the potential to overcome the longstanding activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Dynamically Dual&#8208;Center Coupled Synergistic Catalysis for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism with multi&#8208;pathway for thorough oxygen reduction process in alkaline medium is demonstrated. In situ synchrotron infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations collectively reveal that the Pt single sites optimize the electronic structure of the PdRh nanosheets, thereby enhancing the overall oxygen reduction efficiency on PdRh&#9472;Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) suffers from inherent kinetic limitations arising from the competitive adsorption behavior of *OOH intermediates and their divergent conversion pathways toward either the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant route or the 2e&#8315;&#8208;peroxide byproduct. Conventional single&#8208;component catalysts fundamentally lack temporal&#8208;spatial control to simultaneously accelerate O&#9472;O bond cleavage while suppressing *H2O2 desorption. To overcome this kinetic dilemma, herein, we propose a dynamically dual&#8208;center coupled synergistic (DCCS) catalytic mechanism enabled by precisely engineered PdRh&#9472;Pt nanosheet binary&#8208;component interfaces. Multidimensional in situ synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the activated 4e&#8315; pathway primarily occurs at PdRh sites. Additionally, Pt centers selectively reduce *OOH to *O and *H2O2, whereas neighboring PdRh sites facilitate ultrafast *H2O2 migration and dissociation, effectively complementing the 4e&#8315;&#8208;dominant pathway. Hence, the DCCS catalysis redirects traditionally divergent product pathways toward a singular target product. This interfacial kinetic synergy achieves ultrahigh 4e&#8315; kinetics, demonstrated by a six&#8208;fold increase of turnover frequency compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the derived rechargeable Zn&#8210;air batteries demonstrate exceptional stability over 200&#160;h, establishing a new design principle for breaking kinetics trade&#8208;offs in heterogeneous catalysis through molecularly scheduling reaction pathways.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle Monolayer&#8208;Decorated Nanopipette Enabling in Situ Monitoring of Single&#8208;Cell Redox Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette was developed to visualize single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. Leveraging strong near&#8208;field coupling within the monolayer that forms uniform hotspots, our method enables highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of redox metabolism changes, which deepens the understanding of single&#8208;cell ferroptosis.








Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of how single cells respond to redox perturbations is pivotal for predicting cell fate decisions. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;active nanopipettes hold promise for single&#8208;cell analysis, yet challenges remain in achieving both signal sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, a plasmonic nanoparticle monolayer&#8208;decorated nanopipette has been developed, which serves as a biomimetic endoscope to monitor single&#8208;cell redox metabolism. This is accomplished by the conformal transferring of gold nanoparticle monolayer onto the nanopipette followed by the functionalization of redox&#8208;responsive probes. The strong near&#8208;field coupling within monolayer forms uniform hotspots, enabling highly sensitive and reproducible tracking of SERS signals changes triggered by redox species. Modulated by the nanopipette technology, the endoscope allows for in situ monitoring of global redox states with low invasiveness and high spatial resolution. Further, study of ferroptosis events via simultaneous optical and electrical recording elucidates the correlation between redox imbalance and membrane damage during various ferroptosis&#8208;inducers stimulation, which has not been observed at the single&#8208;cell level. This work provides profound insights into the cellular redox dynamics, contributing to a deeper understanding of related physiopathological pathways.

         <title>Intermolecular sp3C&#8208;H Metalation of Non&#8208;Nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted Bases Using Simple Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted pyridines (tBu2&#8208;py) are widely used non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases. Their ubiquity is due to their highly hindered basic site and chemically robust nature. Herein we report that simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M = Al or Ga, X = Cl, Br or I) effect intermolecular sp3C&#8208;H metalation of tBu2&#8208;py bases under mild conditions. The sp3C&#8208;H metalated products can be converted in&#8208;situ into &#8208;BPin, &#8208;iodo, &#8208;bromo and &#8208;hydroxy derivatives for further elaboration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that: (i) a frustrated Lewis pair effects sp3C&#8208;H heterolysis to form the C&#8208;M bond and a protonated pyridine; (ii) C&#8208;H metalation requires singly halide&#8208;bridged super&#8208;electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low barriers. Finally, sp3C&#8208;H metalation using M2X6 is not limited to tBu2&#8208;py bases. Thus, it is important to be aware of this facile sp3C&#8208;H functionalisation when using a range of non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;2,6-Di-tert-butyl substituted pyridines (tBu2-py) are widely used non-nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases. Their ubiquity is due to their highly hindered basic site and chemically robust nature. Herein we report that simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M = Al or Ga, X = Cl, Br or I) effect intermolecular sp3C-H metalation of tBu2-py bases under mild conditions. The sp3C-H metalated products can be converted in-situ into -BPin, -iodo, -bromo and -hydroxy derivatives for further elaboration. Mechanistic investigations indicate that: (i) a frustrated Lewis pair effects sp3C-H heterolysis to form the C-M bond and a protonated pyridine; (ii) C-H metalation requires singly halide-bridged super-electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low barriers. Finally, sp3C-H metalation using M2X6 is not limited to tBu2-py bases. Thus, it is important to be aware of this facile sp3C-H functionalisation when using a range of non-nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Induced Atomic Diffusion in a Molecular Metal Cluster Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of atomic vacancies in a close&#8208;packed material is believed to allow the migration of atoms adjacent to the vacancies, which induces dynamics of atoms. However, it is not known whether atoms in discrete molecules can undergo vacancy&#8208;induced dynamics. We describe herein the generation of a close&#8208;packed Pd12 cluster complex [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]n (n = 2, 3) with a Pd&#8208;atom vacancy, and the observation of the diffusion of Pd atoms. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis, X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretical calculations indicate that an atomic vacancy is located at the surface sites of the Pd12 core, and that it migrates rapidly on the NMR timescale. This means that all 11 palladium atoms at the surface undergo self&#8208;diffusion with a low energy barrier. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that atomic diffusion occurs within a molecule through the vacancy mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bifunctional Organic Photocatalyst for Efficient Single&#8208;Electron and Energy Transfer Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional photocatalysts capable of mediating both single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (EnT) processes are rare and typically metal&#8208;based. Here, we present 3&#8208;thioaryl&#8208;4hydroxycoumarins, a new family of cost&#8208;effective organic photocatalysts that leverage a stabilized charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state to achieve both strong reducing power and efficient energy transfer. The spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO stabilizes the CT state, enhancing SET reactivity (E*red = &#8722;3.08 V vs SCE) while maintaining a sufficiently high triplet energy (ET = 67 kcal/mol) for EnT&#8208;driven transformations. This dual reactivity enables the activation of redox&#8208;inert substrates (Ered &lt; &#8722;2.8 V vs SCE) via SET reduction, generating radicals suitable for diverse C&#8211;S, C&#8211;P, C&#8211;B, and C&#8211;C bondforming transformations, alongside EnT&#8208;based processes such as E/Z olefin isomerization and [2+2] photocycloadditions. Mechanistic studies, supported by photophysical and theoretical analyses, confirmed the catalyst&#8217;s bifunctionality.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;supported Ru&#8211;Ni: a Common Active Site for Hydrolysis, Hydrogen Oxidation, and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insights into the activation and conversion of hydrogen using a single&#8208;mode catalyst is crucial for advancing fuels and fine chemical production. In this paper, the activation and conversion of H2 molecular in hydrogen production and application were investigated on RuM (M = Ni, Co, Cu, Fe)&#8208;MXene catalysts. RuM (M = Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) bimetallic nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on Ti3C2 MXene. The optimal Ru2.5Ni2.5&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibites the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1833 min&#8208;1 toward ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalysts also showed good&#160;catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The high activity is originl from the acceleration of the catalytic process by RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 and the promotion of molecular transport by the special interface of RuNi cluster&#8208;MXene. The RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 with suiable d&#8208;band provide a dependable platform for the regulated activation and conversion of H2 molecules and various reaction intermediates. The competitiveness of nano&#8208;cluster&#8208;MXene catalytic material is showcased for activation and conversion of hydrogen. This research of reaction&#8208;inducing adaptation uncovered the pathway to explore multi&#8208;functional catalysts in energy, chemistry and materials applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adapting Lattice Respiration Enabled by Crystal Design and d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization towards Highly Stable Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the appealing three&#8208;electron transfer feature, low cost and high safety. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and host lattice induces severe lattice distortion and structural collapse, leading to poor cycle stability in RABs. Herein, we develop a new&#8208;type FeWO4 cathode with a comprehensive consideration of the crystal structure and electronic structure. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) open framework and strong W&#8211;O covalent network of the FeWO4 greatly improve the storage of high charge density Al3+. Moreover, the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen facilitates electron delocalization, which effectively weakens the interaction with the trivalent cation (Al3+). Importantly, combining in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that as&#8208;prepared cathode exhibits a &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration&#8221; (SALR) effect. Specifically, the reversible W&#8211;O bond elongation/compression (&#916;d&#8776;0.05 &#197;) during cycling reduces lattice strain and confines volume expansion to less than 3%. As results, the FeWO4 cathode delivers a high capacity of 192 mAh g&#8211;1 at 500 mA g&#8211;1 and long cycle life of over 2300 cycles with quiet low capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle in RABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dominated Calendar Aging in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. While the majority of current research focuses on cyclic aging, the impact of calendar aging on zinc anodes has received far less attention. Here, we reveal that zinc deposition morphology, governed by anion chemistry, plays a decisive role in calendar degradation by amplifying interfacial corrosion and accelerating &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc accumulation. Notably, intrinsic corrosion rates alone do not predict degradation severity; for instance, triflate anion shows low corrosion but induces highly porous deposits and rapid aging. To address this, we propose&#160;a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49&#8208;fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6&#8208;hour aging intervals per cycle), practical anode&#8208;free Cu||ZnI2 cells (~3 mAh cm&#8211;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000 hours. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of zinc anode degradation and offer a viable route to address calendar aging in ZMBs.</dc:description>

To address this, we propose&#160;a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49-fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6-hour aging intervals per cycle), practical anode-free Cu||ZnI2 cells (~3 mAh cm&#8211;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000 hours. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of zinc anode degradation and offer a viable route to address calendar aging in ZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Accompanying ATP Synthesis in Polydopamine Microreactors Covered by Lipid Bilayers with ATPase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global energy and environmental crises have stimulated increased efforts towards converting CO2&#160;into valuable chemicals or energy substance. Inspired by natural chloroplasts and mitochondria, we build&#160;an innovative polydopamine&#8208;armored multiple enzyme microreactor for co&#8208;immobilizing glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric phosphokinase (PGK), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and ATPase&#8208;incorporating proteoliposome, providing spatially confined microenvironments akin to natural systems. Within this microreactor,&#160;GAPDH and PGK catalyze the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate to 3&#8208;phosphoglyceric acid, reducing &#946;&#8208;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH and generating a proton influx that drives ATP synthesis.&#160;The microreactor possesses strong affinity for CO2, combined with FDH, facilitates the reduction of CO2&#160;to formic acid, oxidizing NADH back to NAD+&#160;and enabling the recycling of the NAD+/NADH redox couple. This process further&#160;boosts ATP production by contributing additional protons. Such microreactor adeptly orchestrates the chloroplast's enzymes to fix CO2&#160;and the mitochondrion's enzymes to synthesize ATP into a unified artificial biomimetic system, effectively replicating the glycolysis process to simultaneously achieve CO2&#160;fixation, NADH regeneration and ATP synthesis. This strategy not only holds great potential to inspire significant design innovations for more efficient ATP synthesis from low&#8208;value substances, but also greatly expands the application scenarios for biomolecular motors.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Polyoxometalate Crosslinked Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Polymer as Artificial Interfacial Layer for Highly Persistent and Low&#8208;Temperature Tolerant Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uncontrolled lithium (Li) dendrite growth and fragile native solid electrolyte interphase formation have severely hindered the practical development of Li metal batteries. Herein, a coordinatively cross&#8208;linked metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer as anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) is developed by utilizing titanium(IV)&#8208;polyoxometalates (Ti&#8208;POMs) as hexatopic linkers to bridge organic and inorganic moieties. The constructed MSP&#8208;IPL possesses high electrochemical stability, superior ion&#8208;transfer ability, and good air stability. Due to its high film formation uniformity and mechanical tenacity, the MSP&#8208;IPL can effectively avoid non&#8208;uniform Li deposition caused by the tip effect, thus inhibiting Li dendrite proliferation. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs in polymer skeleton can efficiently bind with PF6&#8208; anions, thus increasing Li+ transference number and promoting homogeneous Li+ distribution. The re&#8208;processability and self&#8208;healing ability endowed by dynamic coordination bonds enable the MSP&#8208;IPL to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interface contact. Consequently, high&#8208;loading Li||LiFePO4 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries based on MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li anodes demonstrate impressive cyclability and extraordinary rate capability. Even at a low temperature of &#8211;20 &#176;C, the MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li||NCM811 batteries can still cycle stably for over 500 cycles (equivalent to 138 days) with a considerable capacity retention of 86.8%. This work presents a promising solution for developing practical low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Lanthanide&#8208;based Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Multi&#8208;Mode Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of metal&#8208;organic framework materials expanded in a two&#8208;dimensional plane, which have a wide range of applications in fields of optoelectronic devices, sensors, and information storage due to their unique layered structure and excellent optical properties. Currently, research on luminescent 2D MOFs mainly focuses on down&#8208;shifting luminescence, while the exploration of upconversion luminescence remains in its early stages. Herein, a novel two&#8208;dimensional Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and red upconversion luminescence at 660 nm under 980 nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. In addition, multi&#8208;mode emitting MOFs with both upconversion and down&#8208;shifting luminescence were further constructed by co&#8208;doping Tb3+ or Eu3+. Inspired by the layered structure of 2D materials, multilayer stacked 2D MOFs composites were prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation method and upconversion luminescence was realized for the first time by interfacial energy transfer between different components. This strategy not only expands the optical modulation of luminescent 2D MOFs, but also provides new ideas for the construction of multifunctional luminescent materials. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Tailored Molybdenum&#8208;Nickel Catalyst Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation and Suppresses Parasitic Oxygen Reduction for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous existing strategies struggle to mitigate reverse&#8208;current decay (RCD) during startup and shutdown in polymer electrolyte fuel cells to avoid cathode corrosion, but the added system complexity and cost are drawbacks. Here we report that modification of a molybdenum&#8208;nickel alloy through the doping of copper enables a non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) that efficiently catalyzes hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) while catalytically inactive toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, making it ideal for fuel&#8208;cell anode because the instantaneous interfacial potential jump originated from the parasitic ORR during device startup/shutdown can be surmounted. The catalyst, when assembled in the anode of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell, manifests substantially improved corrosion&#8208;resistant ability compared with that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt/C) catalyst. The basis for the achieved performances reveals to be the copper dopants that increase the hydrogen bonding of interfacial water for enhanced HOR, yet weaken molecular oxygen adsorption while stabilizing hydroxyl adsorption for ORR suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Delocalized Cu2+ Activates Spin Channels in Spinel Oxides to Selectively Produce 1O2 for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron&#8208;delocalization strategy that unlocks ATd2+&#8208;O&#8208;BOh3+ electron&#8208;transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu0.8Fe2.2O4), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective 1O2 generation. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron&#8208;delocalized Cu2+ triggers a high spin&#8208;state of O in FeTd2+&#8208;O&#8208;FeOh3+, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the FeOh3+ adsorption site to the FeTd2+ adsorption site through FeTd2+&#8208;O&#8208;FeOh3+. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO4&#8226;&#8211; and SO5&#8226;&#8211; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO4&#8226;&#8211; rapidly oxidizes SO5&#8226;&#8211; into 1O2, enhancing 1O2 generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of 1O2 in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale&#8208;up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48 h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective 1O2 generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare earth lanthanum element has large atomic radius, multi&#8208;shell orbital electrons, and Fenton&#8208;like reaction inertia, on which a localized high&#8208;coordination structure can be easily formed for the favorable adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, for single&#8208;atom lanthanum sites, due to the loss of all the outmost s and d electrons, the practically vacuous outmost orbitals are stable but sleepy for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we synthesize a novel dual&#8208;atom La catalyst onto N&#8208;doped graphene (La2&#8208;NG) by a Joule ultrafast heating method, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.893 V for the ORR. The La2&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrates a great open circuit voltage of 1.52 V and a maximal power density of 192 mW cm&#8722;2. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of La2&#8208;N6 moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La2&#8208;N6 structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Communicative Nanomotors Reprogram Cancer Cell Death via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomotors offer significant advantages over passive nanoparticles in biomedical applications. However, their potential has been largely restricted to cargo transport, with limited capacity for interaction with biological systems. Here, we present next&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembled nanomotors that not only exhibit chemotactic motility but also actively communicate with cells, reprogramming cell fate by inducing pyroptosis. These nanomotors are designed to respond to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment, triggering nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;driven propulsion and selective mitochondria targeting via triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface engineering. This interaction induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and activation of gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Furthermore, their chemotactic motility facilitates deeper tumor tissue penetration in 3D spheroids, demonstrating their ability to navigate physiological barriers. By shifting the paradigm from motility&#8208;driven to interactive nanomedicine, this study establishes a transformative platform for targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable yet Strongly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Anions Enabling Cooperative Catalysis with Cationic Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic transition metal complexes play a crucial role as catalysts in organic transformations. Their counter&#8208;anions often stand aside from the catalytic cycle or occasionally participate in the catalytic cycle as a Br&#248;nsted base due to their nucleophilic character. Herein, we developed a stable yet Lewis acidic anion, BBcat, based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and featuring Lewis acidic catechol borane moieties and applied it to transition metal catalysis to recognize Lewis basic substrates. Upon admixture with Bu4N&#8208;BBcat, 31P NMR chemical shift of O=PEt3 significantly lower&#8208;shifted implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a non&#8208;coordinating counter&#8208;anion. Ir/PHOX&#8208;BBcat exhibited an 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX&#8208;BArF consisting of the non&#8208;coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis basic sites, located at remote positions to the C&#8211;H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition metal center and the counter&#8208;anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Activity of Cu4 Clusters Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play a crucial role in modifying catalytic environments and enhancing performance through various mechanisms. However, the multivariate synergistic mechanisms, dynamic evolution patterns, and universal design principles of ligand effects remain to be thoroughly investigated. Metal clusters, with their atomically precise structures, serve as ideal models for studying ligand regulation mechanisms. Herein, we synthesized two copper clusters of N,S&#8208;bidentate ligand&#8208;protected Cu4(PTI)4 and Cu4(BTT)4 featuring identical metallic core structures but distinct ligand architectures, and evaluated their catalytic performance for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Notably, the Cu4(PTI)4 cluster with stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands achieved near&#8208;100% Faradaic efficiency at optimal potentials, significantly surpassing the Cu4(BTT)4. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we unveiled that enhancing the electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of ligands induces alterations in the local microenvironment and electronic structure of metal active sites, thereby exerting positive impacts on electrocatalytic NO3RR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Multilevel Chiroptical Activity in Organic Supramolecular Microcrystals for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic materials are rapidly emerging as a promising platform for circularly polarized lasing. However, the lag in mechanistic research has severely hindered the development of organic circularly polarized lasers. Here, we attempt to probe multilevel chiroptical activity in organic supramolecular microcrystals for exploring high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. The evolution of chiroptical activity is tracked spanning from chiral molecular monomers to dimers to supramolecular helices. The crucial roles of excimers and supramolecular helices in achieving high optical gain and large chiroptical activity are revealed. Accordingly, circularly polarized lasing with low thresholds and large dissymmetry factors is realized in the organic supramolecular microcrystals. Our work marks the beginning of mechanistic research on chirality induced circularly polarized lasing, which will initiate the rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries attract great interest, but their poor safety and cycling performance hinder their applications, especially with high cut&#8208;off voltage nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode.

Such CEI exhibits a gradual decrease in C&#8208;F and a gradient increase in LiF and LiBxOy from the outside to the inside, which effectively inhibits structural degradation of the NCM94 cathode. With an excellent CEI, Li|| NCM94 batteries show outstanding cycling stability and wide temperature applicability (&#8208;40~60 &#176;C). The battery could exhibit a capacity retention of 87 % after 200 cycles at 4.8 V, and deliver 112 % (or 56 %) of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at 60/&#8208;40 &#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, as&#8208;constructed 7.6 Ah pouch cell could run 145 cycles with an energy density of 541 Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides the guidance on designing electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces for wide&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold and Bismuth Trimetallic Synergistic Redox Catalysis for Non&#8208;Directed C&#8208;H Arylation with Aryl Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of substituent effects plays an important role on the efficiency and regioselectivity toward C&#8208;H activation of non&#8208;directed arenes. Here, an unprecedented trimetallic synergistic redox catalysis system has been developed to achieve a highly efficient and orthogonal C&#8211;H arylation of non&#8208;directed arenes with aryl bismuth. Both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;deficient aryl bismuth can proceed C&#8208;H arylation readily, thus affording an elegant strategy for the synthesis of challenging electron&#8208;rich and sterically hindered biaryls by means of gold catalysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bi(V) species generated in&#8208;situ from Ar&#8208;Bi(III) and NFSI is not only an arylating reagent but also an oxidant to form a critical Au(II)&#8208;Au(II)&#8208;Bi intermediate (detected by HRMS). Interestingly, the binding Bi&#8208;moiety can modulate the electronic and steric environment of gold center through cooperative interactions, thus promoting the intramolecular transmetallation and reductive elimination. In addition, the synthetic robustness of this protocol has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiments and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.</dc:description>

Interestingly, the binding Bi-moiety can modulate the electronic and steric environment of gold center through cooperative interactions, thus promoting the intramolecular transmetallation and reductive elimination. In addition, the synthetic robustness of this protocol has been demonstrated by gram-scale experiments and late-stage functionalization of complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Length Ratio&#8208;Driven Configurational Modulation of Heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular configurational&#160;modulation&#160;is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of biological systems. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we present a strategy to modulate the configurations of heteroleptic Pd6L6L'6 cages by systematically varying the ligand length ratio (r). Although theoretical analysis suggests that these Pd6L6L'6 assemblies could adopt up to 48 possible configurational isomers, we successfully modulated the thermodynamic preference between two dominant configurations (Type&#8208;A and Type&#8208;B) by implementing energetic differentiation through careful optimization of r. Specifically, the system exclusively forms Type&#8208;A cages at r = 1.0, whereas Type&#8208;B becomes the predominant configuration when r &#8805; 1.4. Control experiments demonstrate that the introduction of bulky steric groups does not induce configuration changes. This research offers valuable insights and serves as a useful reference for the design and configurational modulation of heteroleptic cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) of bismuth oxychloride with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield after photocatalytic N2 reduction under solar light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to overcome confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect, leading to &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing their transfer path from (001) to (101) crystal plane. As a result, a new nitrogen reduction pathway with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation is found, as reported by Wen Liu et&#160;al. (e202503097).

         <title>Mechanistic Insights: Correspondence on &#8220;Tuning Co&#8208;Operative Energy Transfer in Copper(I) Complexes Using Two&#8208;Photon Absorbing Diimine&#8208;Based Ligand Sensitizers&#8221;</title>

One photon or two photons, that is the question. A closer look at the recently presented photosensitizer [Cu(bathocupSANI)2]BF4 revealed that a single red/NIR photon per catalytic turnover is sufficient for photooxygenation reactions. Mechanistic challenges, pitfalls, and opportunities for future research in photocatalysis are identified.








Abstract
In a recent communication, Collins and coworkers presented a Cu(I) complex with photocatalytic activity under red light LED conditions, mainly for singlet oxygen&#8208;driven reactions. Guided by steady&#8208;state emission measurements with 800&#160;nm excitation, the authors suggested that the underlying mechanism for the generation of the photoexcited key species is a simultaneous two&#8208;photon absorption via a virtual state. However, such a mechanism requires pulsed laser excitation and cannot compete when a conventional one&#8208;photon excitation is also feasible with the selected excitation wavelength range. Using several spectroscopic techniques and reactivity assays under different light color and intensity conditions, we unambiguously demonstrate that a conventional one&#8208;photon excitation followed by rather inefficient singlet oxygen generation (quantum yield&#160;&lt;5%) is responsible for the observed photoreactivity of the Cu(I) complex. In addition, we briefly summarize general mechanistic considerations, estimate typical photon densities required for a variety of two&#8208;photon mechanisms, highlight the importance of optical filters and impurities to avoid artifacts in the emission spectra, and present some guidelines for the differentiation between one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon mechanisms.

         <title>Enantiomerically Enriched Aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Kinetic Resolution of 2H&#8208;Azirines</title>

         <dc:description>
Kinetic resolution by copper hydride catalyzed reduction of 2H&#8208;azirines secured optically enriched N&#8208;H aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and good enantioselectivity (up to 94% ee). DFT calculations and non&#8208;covalent interaction analysis established the reaction pathway and revealed two key non&#8208;covalent interactions that account for the enantioselectivity.








Abstract
We present the first reductive kinetic resolution of racemic 2H&#8208;azirines to prepare optically enriched N&#8208;H aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, which are bench stable and readily diversifiable building blocks, concomitantly with the corresponding enantiomerically enriched 2H&#8208;azirines. The N&#8208;H aziridines were obtained with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94%). A Hammett study revealed a linear free energy relationship between the &#916;&#916;G&#10727; of the diastereomeric transition states and the &#963;p&#8722; values. density functional theory (DFT) calculations and non&#8208;covalent interaction analysis suggested that non&#8208;classical H&#8211;bonding interactions and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions between the substrate and the ligand are responsible for the stereoselectivity and also for the substrate electronic effects observed in the Hammett study.

A Hammett study revealed a linear free energy relationship between the &#916;&#916;G&lt;sup&gt;&#10727;&lt;/sup&gt; of the diastereomeric transition states and the &#963;&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; values. density functional theory (DFT) calculations and non-covalent interaction analysis suggested that non-classical H&#8211;bonding interactions and edge-to-face aromatic interactions between the substrate and the ligand are responsible for the stereoselectivity and also for the substrate electronic effects observed in the Hammett study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of an Activity Selector for the Nitroso&#8208;Forming Activity in Bacterial Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small but crucial difference: Type&#8208;III copper enzymes, like tyrosinase (TYR) and o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase (AO), catalyze the oxidation of o&#8208;aminophenols (AP) to quinone imines. Unlike TYR, AO can further oxidize AP to nitrosophenols. This nitroso&#8208;forming activity is controlled by a key amino acid near the Cu(A) ion. Mutating Asn to Ile in the AO SgGriF converts it to a TYR, while the homologous Ile to Asn mutation in SzTYR switches it from a TYR to an AO. 








Abstract
O&#8208;aminophenol oxidases, a specialized subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bioactive nitrosophenols, which display antiretroviral and blood cholesterol&#8208;lowering activity. Another related subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, tyrosinases, closely resemble o&#8208;aminophenol oxidases structurally and enzymatically but lack their unique ability to oxidize o&#8208;aminophenols into nitrosophenols. To unpuzzle the catalytic disparities of both subclasses, highly conserved amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center were identified. Notably, the Asn43 residue in the o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgGriF) plays a pivotal role in its nitroso&#8208;forming activity. Mutating the Asn43 residue in SgGriF to isoleucine, which is present at the homologous position Ile42 in the tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. ZL&#8208;24 (SzTYR), resulted in the loss of the nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SgGriF. Conversely, exchanging Ile42 in SzTYR to asparagine generates nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SzTYR. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of converting an o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase into a tyrosinase and vice versa through a single amino acid mutation, underscoring the potential of these findings for future applications in medicinal and material sciences.

         <title>Tuning Multi&#8208;Active Sites in Cu Catalyst via Ag/Ni Doping for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites can effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, ultimately achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) for the synthesis of C2+ products.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to C2+ products is a promising sustainable carbon conversion pathway, yet simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density remains a challenge. Herein, we found that creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites could effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, thereby achieving highly efficient ECR to synthesize C2+ products. In situ measurements coupling theoretical calculations indicated that by systematically altering the spatial arrangement and distribution of active sites in Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalysts, the electronic structure and the local *CO coverage on the Cu surface could be tuned, consequently steering the ECR to C2+ pathway. In particular, Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi DNPs) could more effectively reduce the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling than Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with phase&#8208;separated multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi PNPs). As a result, the Cu40AgNi DNPs catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites yielded C2+ products with a FE of 93.2% and a current density up to 818.1 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.38&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), which are higher than most reported up to date for C2+ production. This work provides a methodology for designing robust multi&#8208;metallic ECR catalysts with tailored multi&#8208;active site configurations.

         <title>Deciphering the Crystallographic Effect in Radially Architectured Polycrystalline Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we reveal the crucial role of crystallography in high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes. Unlike the belief that radial architecture's preferential texture enhances performance, we show it alters misorientation distribution by increasing low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries. This reduces chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation, improving Li+ diffusion and ultimately enhancing rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes.








Abstract
Layered oxide cathode materials with primary&#8211;secondary architecture face challenges of inhomogeneous Li+ diffusion and chemomechanical degradation due to misorientations between equiaxed primary particles. Although a radial architecture, featuring elongated grains, is widely believed to enhance diffusion, it does not address the root cause of chemomechanical failure&#8212;crystallographic misorientation. The impact of crystallography on the electrochemical performance of radially architectured secondary particles, compared to conventional designs, remains poorly understood. Here, by combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we decipher the crucial role of crystallography in the performance and stability of polycrystalline high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode materials. Contrary to the conventional belief that a preferential texture induced by the radial architecture is the key to performance enhancement, we uncover that the radial architecture primarily alters the misorientation distribution by introducing substantially increased low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries that significantly mitigate chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation. This crystallographic refinement facilitates enhanced Li+ diffusion between primary particles, ultimately boosting the rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes. By quantitatively uncovering the crystallographic influence on performance, this work provides a new avenue for optimizing Li+ diffusion kinetics and chemomechanical resilience in polycrystalline cathode materials through crystallographic engineering.

         <title>Nanoconfined Ultrathin Polymer Membrane for Ultrafast Separation of Biobutanol from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging dissolution&#8211;crosslinking competition of linear polymer during an interfacial cross&#8208;linking reaction, a sub&#8208;10 nm thick polymer membrane was fabricated and precisely confined within the permanent voids of alumina supporting nanolayer. Through this nanoconfined ultrathin polymer membrane, 1.0&#160;wt% of aqueous n&#8208;butanol can be concentrated 14.2&#8208;fold, with a record&#8208;breaking liquid flux of 110&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Efficient recovery of biobutanol, a next&#8208;generation biofuel, from fermentation liquor remains challenging due to its low concentration and volatility. This study introduces ultrathin rubbery polymer membranes developed through an interfacial dissolution&#8211;crosslinking method, with cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane confined within the permanent nanovoids of ceramic alumina substrates. The resulting membranes, which are less than 10&#160;nm thick, achieve unparalleled performance: concentrating 1.0&#160;wt% aqueous n&#8208;butanol 14.2&#8208;fold with a record&#8208;high liquid flux of 110&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#8212;one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of previously reported membranes. These advancements suggest significant reductions in the membrane area and operational costs for large&#8208;scale biobutanol separation, establishing a sustainable and economical solution for biofuel production.

The resulting membranes, which are less than 10&#160;nm thick, achieve unparalleled performance: concentrating 1.0&#160;wt% aqueous &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol 14.2-fold with a record-high liquid flux of 110&#160;kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8212;one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of previously reported membranes. These advancements suggest significant reductions in the membrane area and operational costs for large-scale biobutanol separation, establishing a sustainable and economical solution for biofuel production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive Defluoroamination of Aryl Fluorides: Harnessing the Catalytic Potential of a Unique Zinc Amide Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed an effective and adaptable catalytic protocol for the radical&#8208;mediated defluoroamination of fluoroarenes, utilizing a redox&#8208;active amide ligand&#8208;supported zinc(II) compound. Intriguingly, this accommodative protocol offers several advantages, e.g., the mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope (covering most types of fluoroarenes and diverse N&#8208;nucleophiles) with excellent functional group tolerance, selective C&#9472;F bond functionalization, and access to tertiary aryl amines in one&#8208;pot manner starting from the primary amine itself via double C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
The activation and functionalization of C&#9472;F bonds, the strongest bonds between carbon and any other element, via C&#9472;N bond formation to generate complex molecules has remained a compelling challenge. Herein, we present a ligand&#8208;centered redox&#8208;controlled effective strategy employing a zinc amide catalyst (C) to achieve facile defluoroamination of fluoroarenes with several N&#8208;nucleophiles (&gt;90 substrates) under mild conditions. Notably, this adaptable protocol works readily with most types of fluoroarenes and a diverse range of N&#9472;H moieties that include secondary and primary amines, indoles, azoles, and&#160;amides under the same reaction conditions and encouragingly offers excellent functional group compatibility. Intriguingly, we also demonstrated its application in one&#8208;pot synthesis of (un)symmetrical triaryl amines from primary amine itself and the selective activation of C&#9472;F bonds to access F&#8208;containing amines, relevant to drug synthesis. Finally, detailed mechanistic probes via active&#8208;intermediate&#8208;capture, EPR analysis, and various control experiments indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical&#8208;mediated C&#9472;N coupling pathway. Importantly, use of Zn(II) center as a template to hold the two amide moieties together in C enables facile intramolecular electron transfer to generate the radical intermediates for the present protocol. Finally, the practical utility of this methodology was&#160;showcased by synthesizing various drug derivatives.

         <title>Catching Fullerenes: Synthesis of Molecular Nanogloves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we disclose the synthesis of curved cavitands. The efficient and straightforward hybridization of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene results in well&#8208;defined rigid receptors capable of capturing fullerenes with high affinity. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a new series of rigid, all meta&#8208;phenylene, conjugated deep&#8208;cavity molecules, displaying high binding affinity towards buckyballs. A facile synthetic approach with an overall combined yield of approximately 53% in the last two steps has been developed using a templating strategy that combines the general structure of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene. These two moieties are covalently linked via four acetal bonds, resulting in a glove&#8208;like architecture. 1H NMR titration experiments reveal fullerene binding affinities (Ka) exceeding &#8805;106&#160;M&#8722;1. The size complementarity between fullerenes and these scaffolds maximizes CH&#8943;&#960; and &#960;&#8943;&#960; interactions, and their host:guest adduct resembles a ball in a glove, hence their name as nanogloves. Fullerene recognition is tested by suspending carbon soot in a solution of nanoglove in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane, where more than a dozen fullerenes are observed, ranging from C60 to C96.

         <title>S&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced &#8220;Proton Fence Effect&#8221; Enables Selectivity Switching between CH4 and CO in Photo&#8208;Assisted CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective switching of C1 product between CH4 and CO during photo&#8208;assisted CO2 electroreduction is realized by a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; effect resulting from sulfur vacancies (SV). CO2 undergoes complete hydrogenation to CH4 (93.6% FE) over CuInS2/CuS stabilized by photo&#8208;generated holes, while *OH anchored on Sv of CuInS2/CuS1&#8208;x hinders local proton migration with preferential *CO desorption, exclusively furnishing CO (95.3% FE).








Abstract
Upcycling CO2 into high&#8208;value C1 products is impressive for achieving carbon neutrality and energy sustainability, while rational modulation of C1 product selectivity is one of the biggest challenges in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) due to the competing reaction pathways and thermodynamic limitation. Here, we showcase a &#8220;proton fence&#8221; strategy enabled by in situ adsorbed *OH on sulfur vacancies (SV) to ultraselectively switch the C1 product between CH4 and CO during CO2RR, with Faraday efficiency of 93.6% and 95.3%, respectively. In situ measurements uncover that the photo&#8208;generated holes counteract Cu2+ electroreduction to retain the intact structure of CuInS2/CuS, while *OH dissociated from water can spontaneously anchor toward SV to hinder the local proton migration, completely circumventing multiproton products. Meanwhile, the preferential desorption of *CO from Cu centers adjacent to the *OH&#8208;anchored SV renders the exclusive formation of CO. In the absence of SV, *CO can be further hydrogenated in a lower free energy/even spontaneously to afford CH4. The proposed proton confinement effect furnishes a promising reference for the selectivity control of eCO2RR, and the photo&#8208;assisted electroreductive protocol demonstrates a paradigm of in situ stabilization of electron&#8208;intolerant catalytic structures.

Meanwhile, the preferential desorption of *CO from Cu centers adjacent to the *OH-anchored S&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; renders the exclusive formation of CO. In the absence of S&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, *CO can be further hydrogenated in a lower free energy/even spontaneously to afford CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The proposed proton confinement effect furnishes a promising reference for the selectivity control of eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, and the photo-assisted electroreductive protocol demonstrates a paradigm of in situ stabilization of electron-intolerant catalytic structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent Induced Transformation of Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Large Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Three homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2 were synthesized. Upon stimulation with methanol, Ag98 undergoes an intercluster reaction with in situ generated Ag74 to form Ag86, which subsequently transforms into the thermodynamically stable Ag74. This study represents the first observation of an intercluster reaction during the cluster transformation process.








Abstract
Structural transformation of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters is of significant interest because of its relevance to the formation mechanisms and stability of metal clusters. Herein, we report three large homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2, synthesized from the same precursor 2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;CAg via fine&#8208;tuning the reduction rate. X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrates that Ino decahedral Ag13 units serve as building blocks in all three nanoclusters. Remarkably, Ag98 undergoes an intercluster transformation in methanol. It initially converts into Ag74, then Ag74 reacts with Ag98 to form Ag86, which eventually is transformed into the thermodynamically stable Ag74. Time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) confirms such a multi&#8208;step reaction process during the transformation, identifying Ag86 as the key intermediate. Our findings not only provide new insights into the structural transformation pathways of nanoclusters but also enhance the understanding of transformation mechanisms, contributing to the rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters.

         <title>A Programmable Nanoparticle Conversion Pathway to Monodisperse Polyelemental High Entropy Alloy, Intermetallic, and Multiphase Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelemental nanoparticles, composed of four or more elements, encompass high&#8208;entropy alloys, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics, and multiphase structures such as Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. These nanoparticles were obtained through the thermal transformation of colloidally synthesized core&#8208;shell nanoparticles. Systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity of the precursor nanoparticles, combined with atomistic simulations evaluating phase stability, reveal that the final mixing states of these nanoparticles are dictated by the interplay between enthalpy and entropy of mixing.








Abstract
Polyelemental nanoparticles (PE NPs), those consisting of four or more elements, exhibit unique properties from synergistic compositional effects. Examples include high entropy alloys, high entropy intermetallics, and multiphase types, including Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. Although colloidal syntheses offer excellent structural control for mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;elemental compositions, achieving the same control for PE NPs remains challenging. Here, this challenge is addressed with a NP conversion strategy wherein different types of PE NPs &#8211; including high entropy alloy, high entropy intermetallic, and multiphase Janus nanoparticles &#8211; are achieved through thermal transformation of readily synthesized colloidal core&#8208;shell NPs. Through systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity to the core&#8208;shell precursor NPs, along with atomistic simulations that probe phase stabilities, we deduce that the final mixing states of the various NPs are governed by the balance between the enthalpy and entropy of mixing. Moreover, our annealing method allows us to trap NPs at intermediate states of mixing, creating distinct surface ensembles that were evaluated as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report colloidally derived precursor NPs enabling the synthesis of all types of PE NPs in a single process. This NP conversion strategy offers a general route to diverse PE NPs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Photosensitizing Cobalt Complexes for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupled with CH3OH Oxidation</title>

Self&#8208;photosensitizing non&#8208;noble metal complexes achieve CO2 photoreduction coupled with CH3OH photooxidation, simultaneously synthesizing formic acid in the absence of any additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants.








Abstract
The use of metal complexes as homogeneous molecular catalysts has attracted considerable attention regarding photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Enhancing these complexes with photosensitivity and photooxidation capabilities, aiming to create multifunctional molecular devices, presents significant challenges. In response to these challenges, we successfully designed and synthesized three innovative metal complexes. The complexes demonstrate a remarkable ability to perform CO2 photoreduction in tandem with methanol photooxidation, allowing for the simultaneous production of formic acid without requiring additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants. An optimal turnover number (TON) value of 855 was obtained under simulated sunlight. Even under natural sunlight, the TON can reach 207, much higher than the value of the physical mixture of the photocatalytic reductive and oxidative moieties. Spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that integrating reduction and oxidation sites in one molecular catalyst can promote charge transfer kinetics and enhance activity for CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation. This is the first report that non&#8208;noble metal homogeneous catalysts can simultaneously possess photosensitivity, photoreduction, and photo&#8208;oxidation functions, offering new insights into designing homogeneous catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

Electrocatalysis is governed by elusive, dynamic interfacial processes. In their Research Article (e202423177), Charlotte Vogt and co&#8208;workers introduce dynamic response spectroscopy (DRS) to isolate time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic features of the electric double layer during CO2 electroreduction over copper. This method reveals discrete restructuring events and water dynamics correlated with CO2 turnover, offering a new paradigm for probing electrochemical interfaces (Cover design: Thomas Hartman).

Enzyme specificity defines function: aminophenol oxidase uniquely converts aminophenols into nitrosophenols, whereas tyrosinase transforms them into quinone imines. This distinction is governed by a key amino acid near the copper(A) active site. In their Research Article (e202501560), Annette Rompel et&#160;al. demonstrated that a single amino acid exchange&#8212;swapping asparagine in SgGriF with isoleucine in SzTYR&#8212;can effectively invert the enzymes&#8217; functions.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: A Single&#8208;Molecule Liposome Assay for Membrane Permeabilisation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule liposome assay for membrane permeabilization using confocal microscopy paired with a fast&#8208;flow microfluidics device is reported by Scott L. Cockroft, Mathew H. Horrocks et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503678). Liposomes, encapsulating calcium&#8208;sensitive dye, pass through the channel aligned with the microscope. Membrane&#8208;permeabilizing agents allow calcium influx, sensitizing the dye which is detected as the liposome passes through the confocal volume. As successive liposomes pass through the volume, signals acquired indicate the permeabilising properties of the analyte.

Changes in electrode surface chemistry under electrochemical conditions critically influence electrocatalytic performance. In their Communication (e202500965), Julia Kunze&#8208;Liebh&#228;user et al. employed in&#8208;situ electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor the surface state of tungsten carbide (WC) powder electrodes during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and at oxidative potentials. Upon electrochemical polarization, the ubiquitous oxide layer dissolves, which causes exposure of the catalytically active carbide surface under HER conditions.

         <title>Functional SELEX and Biomedical Applications of Aptamers: Beyond Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the limitations of traditional aptamer selection methods, which often ignore functional performance in biological contexts. Functional SELEX now selects aptamers with both high specificity and biological activity (F&#8208;aptamers), making them valuable for therapy and cellular regulation. This minireview further highlights advances, challenges, and opportunities in F&#8208;aptamer research, emphasizing the transformative potential of F&#8208;aptamers in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers, developed through SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), are generally short oligonucleotide molecules with remarkable specificity and binding affinity to diverse biological targets. These molecules have shown promise across such fields as biosensing, molecular diagnostics, and bioimaging. However, while conventional aptamer selection strategies predominantly emphasize binding affinity, they overlook the broader spectrum of potential biological functionalities. This oversight results in aptamers that frequently exhibit limited capacity for direct biological regulation. This inherent limitation in the selection process significantly constrains both the widespread application of aptamers across diverse fields and their therapeutic potential as direct drug candidates. Functional SELEX represents an advancement by refining selection library construction and selection processes to create F&#8208;aptamers that integrate precise molecular recognition with specific biological activities. F&#8208;aptamers hold transformative potential as therapeutic agents, diagnostic tools, and molecular regulators, marking a significant step forward in biomedical applications. This minireview critically assesses recent developments in F&#8208;aptamer SELEX strategies, addressing challenges, and exploring opportunities for future research in this dynamic field.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Polymer Delivery Platforms for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the molecular and vector design strategies, and responsive mechanisms of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, covering pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), enzymes, hypoxia, and dual/multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive vectors. In parallel, it also provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms for drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Furthermore, the review discusses the current challenges and future directions in the field, offering feasible insights for the development of next&#8208;generation TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.








Abstract
Most chemotherapeutic and bioimaging agents struggle with inadequate bioavailability, primarily due to their limited biocompatibility and lack of specificity in targeting, leading to low or decreased anticancer efficacy and inaccurate imaging. To surmount these obstacles, the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, predominantly leveraging the tumor microenvironment (TME), has emerged as a promising strategy. Therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be released controllably at the tumor site by virtue of the bond cleavage or hydrophobic to hydrophilic transformation of TME&#8208;sensitive linkages in TME&#8208;responsive systems, thus augmenting cancer treatment and imaging precision, while simultaneously attenuating the damage to healthy tissues and false imaging signals caused by non&#8208;specific drug leakage. In this comprehensive review, we scrutinize recent studies of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms, encompassing pH&#8208;, ROS&#8208;, GSH&#8208;, enzyme&#8208;, and hypoxia&#8208;responsive vectors, significantly from the perspective of their molecular design and responsive mechanism, and further summarizing their bio&#8208;application in drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Moreover, this review encapsulates the critical challenges and offers an insightful perspective on the future prospects of TME&#8208;responsive polymer delivery platforms in terms of molecular and vector design.

         <title>Tuning Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters for Selective Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a summary of the structure&#8211;property relationship of atomically precise gold nanoclusters and their application in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. It delves into the underlying mechanisms of CO2 reduction process and identifies the key factors influencing the performance of these nanoclusters. Furthermore, future research directions are discussed to improve efficiency and expand the diversity of multicarbon products from CO&#8322; reduction using gold nanoclusters.








Abstract
The electroreduction of greenhouse gas CO2 into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising way to mitigate climate change and realize carbon cycling. Atomically precise thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters have shown great potential for selective electrochemical conversion of CO2 toward CO due to their quantum confinement effect and unique electronic structures. Additionally, the atomic precision of gold nanocluster is advantageous for investigating the CO2 reduction mechanism, which is typically challenging to understand due to the complexity of the catalytic interface, and unknown structure of the active site in more conventional catalysts. By summarizing CO2 reduction catalyzed by gold nanoclusters, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to the activity, selectivity, and stability of nanocluster catalysts, as well as elucidate the CO&#8322; reduction pathway, thereby contributing to the design of more active and selective nanocluster catalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sequence Control in Sulphur&#8208;Containing Ring&#8208;Opening Co&#8208; and Terpolymerisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulphur&#8208;containing polymers offer unique avenues for degradability, recyclability and optical performance&#8212;but their synthesis is often plagued by side reactions. This minireview outlines recent strategies to control or harness O/S scrambling in ring&#8208;opening co&#8208; and terpolymerisations, enabling precise sequence control. Emerging applications in dynamic materials, self&#8208;assembly, and sustainable plastics are highlighted. 








Abstract
Sulphur&#8208;containing polymers uniquely expand the catalogue of accessible material properties compared to current commodity materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped. Combining sulphur&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing monomers in ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation leads to a reshuffling reaction of the sulphur centres, which has been challenging to control &#8212; a central task for reliably tailoring properties. However, very recent methodologies have emerged that not only suppress but also utilise this phenomenon to precisely access sulphur&#8208;containing polymer structures. These structures can exhibit improved degradability, chemical recyclability, refractive indices and crystallinity compared to their all&#8208;oxygen analogues. Furthermore, underutilised and even entirely untapped monomer feedstocks can become accessible as a result. This minireview aims to provide a roadmap of the tools currently available to selectively access sulphur&#8208;containing co&#8208; and terpolymer structures to enable emerging applications that leverage the chemistry of sulphur.

         <title>Exploring the Interplay of Lattice Dynamics and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Progress Toward Rational Phonon Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights recent advances in understanding the role of lattice dynamics and electron&#8211;phonon coupling in organic semiconductors. Emphasis is placed on mode&#8208;resolved insights into dynamics&#8208;induced electronic disorder, emerging strategies for phonon engineering, and the implications of both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrations on charge transport.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential use in flexible, lightweight, and cost&#8208;effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure&#8212;termed dynamic disorder&#8212;that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low&#8208;frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad range of phonons&#160; drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance. In this review, we explore progress toward uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally activated phonons. We describe the powerful insight that mode&#8208;resolved analyses of electron&#8211;phonon interactions lends toward the rational design of new materials. We highlight recent efforts to achieve this, showcasing proposed strategies to mitigate dynamic disorder through molecular and crystal design. This work offers an overview of the insight gained toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing charge transport in OSCs and outlines pathways for enhancing performance via targeted manipulation of interatomic/intermolecular interactions and resulting phonon&#160;modes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Disruption of 1D Wire&#8208;Like Arrays of Monoatomic Ag(I) Ions: Single&#8208;Crystal Reaction with Crystal Softening</title>

An Ag(I)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic crystal featuring 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies undergoes UV&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photodimerization, transforming periodic metal arrays into dimers, creating voids, and decreasing crystal stiffness.








Abstract
The exploitation of noncovalent bonding in the solid state is attractive to generate one&#8208;dimensional (1D) wire&#8208;like assemblies of metals and uncover dynamic and physical properties of such intriguing structures. Herein, we describe a metal&#8208;organic crystal based on Ag(I) ions that assemble to be organized into 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies maintained by argentophilic interactions. UV&#8208;light irradiation of the crystal composed of the 1D structures results in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization that transforms the 1D periodic metal arrays to isolated metal dimers. The structural reconfiguration creates small voids in the crystal and the resulting solids exhibit a substantial increase in softness up to 60%.

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208;Promoted Decomposition of Cysteine Ester (ITPDC): A General Platform for Controllable Release of Reactive Sulfur Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive sulfur species (RSS) are important endogenous molecules relevant to human health, but general approaches for the controllable release of distinct RSS are still lacking. In this work, we report a well&#8208;defined and safety donation platform for developing triggered RSS donors with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4. This work should extend the applicable chemical space for RSS delivery and research.








Abstract
Endogenously generated reactive sulfur species (RSS) play critical roles in various physiological processes. RSS donors can enhance our understanding of RSS chemical biology and open new avenues for treating RSS&#8208;associated diseases. Nevertheless, general strategies for the controllable release of distinct RSS remain lacking. Herein, we present the first general platform for controllable release of RSS with sulfur oxidation states ranging from &#8722;2 to +4, based on the intramolecular thiol&#8208;promoted decomposition of cysteine ester (ITPDC). We first rationally designed ITPDC&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donors that avoid electrophilic byproducts and exhibit high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;50%). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations elucidated the detailed pathways of pH&#8208;controllable H2S release from ITPDC, and computational studies also predicted other H2S&#8208;related RSS release from the ITPDC&#8208;based motifs. Importantly, we developed a series of ITPDC&#8208;based donors capable of releasing various RSS, including persulfide, hydrogen persulfide, sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Moreover, fluorescent imaging demonstrated the successful cellular delivery of H2S, persulfide, and SO2 from these donors, and the ITPDC&#8208;based motif was employed to create a light&#8208;triggered donor. We anticipate that these innovative chemistries will provide valuable tools for studying sulfur biology and for developing new RSS donors and bio&#8208;orthogonal cleavage techniques.

         <title>Spatio&#8208;Temporal Processes of Diffusion&#8208;Controlled Communication in Hierarchical Multi&#8208;Compartments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the molecular communication of neighboring biomimetic populations in pH&#8208;responsive hierarchically and non&#8208;covalently organized multi&#8208;compartments (HMC) through the assembly of micro&#8208; and nanocompartments. HMC unify key roles for cyclic spatio&#8208;temporal diffusion processes and spatio&#8208;temporal enzyme(&#8208;like) reactions.








Abstract
Exploring the synergy of feedback behavior and molecular communication between micro&#8208; and nanocompartments is of great implication for the development of advanced hierarchical living&#8208;like materials. Non&#8208;covalent interactions are the driving forces for dynamic and temporal events in biomimetic structures. Herein, pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical multi&#8208;compartments (HMC) are constructed via hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between azobenzene units and phospholipid layers through the integration of two distinct structural units: phospholipid&#8208;membranized coacervates (Coa@DMPC) and azobenzene&#8208;functionalized polymersomes (Azo&#8208;Psomes). This enables us to study spatio&#8208;temporal signal pathways for biomimetic pH homeostasis and the triggering of feedback&#8208;controlled peroxidase&#8208;like behavior of Azo&#8208;Psomes within HMC. Compared with undocking systems, the information transmission process within HMC shows a high efficiency. Besides the continuous addition of nutrients, the synchronization of two different biomimetic reactions in HMC requires the spatial loading of glucose oxidase and L&#8208;phenylalanine ammonia lyase in coacervates and of L&#8208;phenylalanine or beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Azo&#8208;Psomes exhibit pH&#8208;responsive feedback&#8208;controlled behavior. The pH&#8208;responsive membrane of Azo&#8208;Psomes is responsible for the spatio&#8208;temporal peroxidase&#8208;like activity of lumen&#8208;integrated beta&#8208;cyclodextrin/hemin complexes in Azo&#8208;Psomes. Finally, this strategy provides a new approach for constructing more complex biomimetic systems by interconnecting at least two membrane&#8208;containing compartments to further explore the synergistic mechanisms and feedback behaviors among artificial cell communities.

         <title>Engineered Biocatalyst for Enantioselective Hydrazone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the discovery and engineering of a hydrazone reductase (HRED) biocatalyst that promotes efficient reduction of protected hydrazones with exceptional stereocontrol. These biotransformations offer a sustainable strategy for synthesizing valuable chiral N&#9472;N containing products that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.








Abstract
Enantioselective reduction of hydrazones provides a convergent and versatile route to synthesize hydrazine&#8208;containing motifs that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, current methods require the use of precious metals, costly chiral ligands, and/or forcing reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a biocatalytic approach for enantioselective hydrazone reduction using engineered imine reductases. Following evaluation of an in&#8208;house panel of &gt;400 IRED sequences, we identified a single IR361 I127F L179V variant that promotes reduction of Cbz&#8208;protected hydrazones. The introduction of additional two mutations via directed evolution afforded HRED1.1 that is 20&#8208;fold more active than the parent template and promotes reduction of a variety of protected hydrazones in high yields and selectivities (&gt;99% e.e.), including in preparative scale biotransformations. Structural analysis of HRED1.1 provides insights into the origins of its unique hydrazone reductase activity. This study offers a powerful biocatalytic route to synthesize valuable chiral hydrazine products and further expands the impressive range of transformations accessible with engineered imine reductases.

         <title>Luminescent Detection of Photomagnetic Effect in a Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Neodymium(III)&#8211;Octacyanidotungstate(IV) Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic neodymium(III)&#8211;tungsten(IV) layered cyanido&#8208;bridged framework combines 4f&#8208;metal&#8208;centered near&#8208;infrared emission with a thermally reversible octacyanidotungstate(IV)&#8208;based photomagnetic response. As a result, it exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescent read&#8208;out of photo&#8208;induced changes in magnetization relying on the ratio between two selected peaks of excitation spectra and their temperature dependence.








Abstract
Photomagnetic materials form a class of magnetic systems, in which light irradiation changes their magnetization. Photomagnetic behavior is often observed in spin transition materials, including spin&#8208;crossover complexes, and can lead to long&#8208;range magnetic ordering. Photo&#8208;induced magnetization can affect different physical properties, including second harmonic generation. Still, despite a growing number of luminescent spin&#8208;crossover systems, the simultaneous switching of both magnetism and luminescence was not yet explored. In this regard, we present systematic studies for a novel coordination polymer composed of anionic NdIII&#8211;[WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; layers, crystallizing with chiral organic cations embedded in the interlayer space. Not only we observe and rationalize theoretically near&#8208;infrared emission of NdIII centers sensitized by [WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; units, but we also found a plausible pathway to track the photomagnetic effect throughout the analysis of the Nd3+ excitation spectra and their temperature dependence. The observed thermally reversible effects in luminescence were correlated with the results of photomagnetic studies, providing an attractive pathway to monitor the light&#8208;induced magnetization changes through a photoluminescent read&#8208;out.

&lt;p&gt;Heterometallic neodymium(III)&#8211;tungsten(IV) layered cyanido-bridged framework combines 4f-metal-centered near-infrared emission with a thermally reversible octacyanidotungstate(IV)-based photomagnetic response. As a result, it exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescent read-out of photo-induced changes in magnetization relying on the ratio between two selected peaks of excitation spectra and their temperature dependence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photomagnetic materials form a class of magnetic systems, in which light irradiation changes their magnetization. Photomagnetic behavior is often observed in spin transition materials, including spin-crossover complexes, and can lead to long-range magnetic ordering. Photo-induced magnetization can affect different physical properties, including second harmonic generation. Still, despite a growing number of luminescent spin-crossover systems, the simultaneous switching of both magnetism and luminescence was not yet explored. In this regard, we present systematic studies for a novel coordination polymer composed of anionic Nd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;[W&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; layers, crystallizing with chiral organic cations embedded in the interlayer space. Not only we observe and rationalize theoretically near-infrared emission of Nd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centers sensitized by [W&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; units, but we also found a plausible pathway to track the photomagnetic effect throughout the analysis of the Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; excitation spectra and their temperature dependence. The observed thermally reversible effects in luminescence were correlated with the results of photomagnetic studies, providing an attractive pathway to monitor the light-induced magnetization changes through a photoluminescent read-out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous Enhanced Heterostructured Halide Solid Electrolytes with High Air Stability and High Abundance for Sustainable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NaCl&#8208;based solid electrolyte reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 is introduced. This heterostructure halide electrolyte effectively balances the ion conductivity and air stability, with a high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding conversion&#8208;type Na//FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Chlorides and fluorides solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) exhibit contrasting extremes in ionic conductivity and moisture sensitivity. In light of these conflicting factors, we introduce a NaCl&#8208;based SE reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3 (denoted as HS&#8208;AlF3), leading to a heterostructure halide architecture, designated as NHxy (where x/y represents the mass ratio of NaCl to HS&#8208;AlF3). The high dispersion of NaCl and HS&#8208;AlF3 during mechanochemical process enables the generation of defective and amorphous structures and nanodomains in NHxy along with F&#8208;Cl anion substitution effect at grain boundaries. These factors collectively promote Na ion transport in NHxy, especially along the NaCl based heterostructures with AlF3 and NaF. This class of SEs achieves the high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. Specifically, NH54 exhibits excellent long&#8208;term air stability at 35% relative humidity, maintaining high ion conductivity without degradation. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD kg&#8722;1 when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding Na//Na symmetric cells demonstrate the stable cycling for at least 1000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 cells assembled with the NH54 after air exposure exhibit the remarkable longevity, sustaining over 400 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. The conversion&#8208;type Na/NH54/FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh g&#8722;1. This work opens the new pathways for inorganic SEs with enhanced economic value, ion conductivity, air stability and suitability for energy&#8208;dense conversion reaction batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Abiotic Synthesis of Ribose on Chiral Mesostructured Hydroxyapatite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective abiotic synthesis of ribose was found to be catalyzed by hydroxyapatite endowed with helically lattice&#8208;distorted chiral mesostructure. Ribose with a significant d&#8208;enantiomeric excess was synthesized on the right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite nanorods due to its enantiomeric adsorption selectivity, which provides new insights and potential evidence supporting the &#8220;RNA world&#8221; hypothesis on the origin of life.








Abstract
The prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose are crucial processes in the origin of life. However, the prebiotic emergence of enantiomerically enriched ribose on primitive Earth remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we propose that the prebiotic enantioselective synthesis of ribose from glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde can be catalyzed by minerals naturally endowed with chiral structure. The chiral mesostructured hydroxyapatite films (CMHAPFs), which consist of lattice&#8208;distorted helical nanorods, can be formed under a hydrothermal condition in the presence of l/d&#8208;malic acid (MA), a compound that may have been present during the early stages of life's emergence. An enantiomeric excess (ee) of 22.5% for d&#8208;ribose was achieved on the d&#8208;CMHAPFs formed by d&#8208;MA. The adsorption conformation of d&#8208;ribose on the surface of right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite is more stable than that of l&#8208;ribose. The different energy barriers for the transition states of ribose enantiomers result in the enantioselective synthesis of ribose, which is attributed to the similar conformation between ribose and the corresponding transition state. Our findings provide valuable insights into the possible role of chiral inorganics in the prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose.

         <title>In Quest of Chemical Probes for DNA Methylation Reader Proteins: Nucleoside and Dimer Analogues of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine Interact with MBD2</title>

Design and convergent synthesis of 5mC, 5mdC and 5mCpG mimics to interact with MBD2 reader protein and disrupt the DNA/MBD2 interaction. NMR studies confirm compound binding at the DNA/MBD2 interface, highlighting the advantage of l&#8208;configuration of 5mdC.








Abstract
DNA methylation modulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns characterise a wide range of diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, and serve as validated therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Among the proteins involved in DNA methylation regulation, the human reader methyl&#8208;CpG binding domain 2 protein (MBD2) exhibits a strong preference for methylated DNA and initiates signalling cascades predominantly resulting in gene repression. The full description of this mechanism is still to be elucidated. Here, we developed original chemical compounds to interfere with MBD2 and its interaction with DNA. Through convergent chemical pathways, we modified 5&#8208;methylcytosine at position N4 and synthesised the corresponding deoxynucleosides and CpG dimers. We tested 70 compounds in two screening assays to assess their interaction with MBD2 and their ability to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex. Remarkably, substituting modified nucleobases into CpG dimers significantly boosted the biological activity. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the configuration (d/l) of the modified nucleosides and identified four dimers (5d, 7e, 15e and 16e) able to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex, highlighting the advantage of the l&#8208;configuration. Importantly, NMR experiments confirmed their interaction with amino acids of MBD2 involved in methylated DNA binding.

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNA Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine SNAP&#8208;Tag Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNAPR is a ribozyme that repurposes O6&#8208;benzylguanine SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for site&#8208;specific labeling of RNA with bioorthogonal alkyne and azide functional groups, fluorophores or photocrosslinkers. The N1A&#8208;alkylated RNA products were converted to N6A&#8208;modified RNA by Dimroth rearrangement. RNA&#8208;catalyzed fluorescent labeling was shown for tRNA, and protein&#8211;RNA photocrosslinking was demonstrated for an m6A reader protein.








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of RNAs with functional handles enables studies of RNA structure, fate, function, and interactions. Ribozymes provide an elegant way to covalently modify RNA of interest (ROI). Here, we report that the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 can be employed as a versatile tool for RNA modification and labeling. Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine cofactors, designed in analogy to SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for protein labeling, MTR1 installs various bioorthogonal functional groups at N1 of a specific adenosine in the RNA target. In this application of ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA labeling, MTR1 is now called SNAPR. In contrast to the self&#8208;labeling SNAP&#8208;tag, which is appended to the protein of interest, SNAPR is a truly intermolecular RNA catalyst (active in trans). SNAPR assembles with the ROI to the active ribozyme, allowing for the transfer of clickable tags, such as azide and alkyne moieties, as well as photolabile groups or cross&#8208;linkers from the guanine cofactor to the ROI. Moreover, we demonstrate a two&#8208;step approach to attach labels at N6 of the target adenosine: first, SNAPR generates N1A&#8208;modified RNA, followed by preparative Dimroth rearrangement to produce N6A&#8208;modified RNA. We demonstrate this strategy with p&#8208;azidobenzyl groups as photocrosslinker to generate covalent RNA&#8211;protein conjugates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox for site&#8208;specific RNA modification.

         <title>Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12: A Geometrically Closed, but Electronically Open Triple&#8208;Shell Icosahedral Gold Cluster and its Geometrically Open Counterpart</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first triple&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12, is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates but does not show stable motifs. This cluster fills the gap between single&#8208;shell clusters and nanoparticles in the form of an icosahedron. This geometrically closed but electronically open cluster co&#8208;crystallizes with an Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)12 cluster, which is in contrast geometrically open but electronically closed. Both clusters provide a unique view of the transition between molecules and nanoparticles.








Abstract
The aesthetic platonic solids have been known since ancient times, and the structure of all five platonic solids is also found in chemical compounds. While gold sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and gold nanoparticles with an icosahedral structure have been known for a long time to exist, a multi&#8208;shell icosahedral gold cluster at the intermediate size between 13 and thousands of atoms has been elusive. Here we present the synthesis and crystallographic characterization of the first triple&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)12 1. The gold core in 1 is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates, but surprisingly no staple motifs are formed. A second cluster, Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)12 2, cocrystallizes and is identified as having a closed electronic shell but can be considered as a geometrically open pendant of 1. The unique clusters are characterized experimentally by EDX, UV/vis, DLS, and EPR and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>A C&#8211;H Arylation&#8208;Based Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the synthesis of planar chiral macrocyclophanes via Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation is reported. It relies on the design of new bifunctional ligands showing optimal noncovalent interactions with the substrate, and involves the dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile precursors. The obtained macrocyclophanes show interesting chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Despite the growing importance of planar chiral macrocyclophanes owing to their unique properties in different areas of chemistry, methods that are effective in controlling their planar chirality are restricted to certain molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report the first Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H arylation that induces planar chirality by installing bulky aryl groups through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). A computer&#8208;assisted approach allowed a fine&#8208;tuning of the structure of the employed chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands to achieve high enantioselectivities. A range of planar chiral macrocyclophanes were successfully synthesized from configurationally labile macrocyclic precursors via C&#8722;H arylation with various perfluoroarenes. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction proceeds via reversible oxidative addition and enantiodetermining C&#8722;H activation. Selected macrocyclophane products showed interesting photophysical and chiroptical properties, which depended on both the nature of the ansa chains and the aromatic moieties.

         <title>Evaluation of Intermolecular Weak Binding Through the Zero&#8208;Field Splitting of an Endofullerene High&#8208;Spin Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron paramagnetic resonance approach was reported to reveal the weak binding in different types of supramolecular co&#8208;crystals of fullerene and porphyrin. The zero&#8208;field splitting effect of the high spin center turned out to be very sensitive to the small oblate and prolate distortion of the fullerene cage, showing that interaction between fullerenes and porphyrins followed the order of PtTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;PdTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;NiTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;ZnTPP&#160;&gt;&#160;H2TPP.








Abstract
Weak binding between molecules is becoming a renowned aspect of molecular engineering, offering an alternative to the tuning of conventional chemical bonds. However, the subtle nature of these interactions poses challenges for characterization using standard techniques. Herein, an efficient method of weak binding characterization based on the zero&#8208;field splitting of a high&#8208;spin probe by electron paramagnetic resonance is presented. Using endofullerene as the high spin center, we achieved direct comparison of the weak binding strengths in F&#8208;MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Zn, Ni, and Pd) and 2F&#8208;3MTPP (M&#160;=&#160;H2, Ni, Pd, and Pt) through the zero&#8208;field splitting parameters. The high&#8208;spin resonance spectrum is sensitive to the small variation in the supramolecular structure. By examining fullerene&#8211;porphyrin co&#8208;crystals with various metal centers and packing arrangements, the relation between intermolecular weak binding and microstructural strain on the fullerene cage is elucidated.

         <title>Thionated Perylenebisimides as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers: Intersystem Crossing, Electron Spin Dynamics, and Application in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found the triplet state lifetime becomes shorter (ca. 0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) with thionation of the carbonyl groups in the PBI chromophore (ca. 127 &#181;s). Both theoretical computation and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra demonstrate the enhanced spin orbit coupling (SOC) upon thionation. Intersystem crossing was observed for dianion of the thionated PBIs, and the triplet state lifetime (18&#8211;85 &#181;s) are long, thus the photoexcited dianions with ISC ability can be used as strong electron donor (the oxidation potential is &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V versus Fc/Fc+) in photocatalytic redox organic reactions.








Abstract
The thionation induced intersystem crossing (ISC) in perylenebisimide (PBI) derivatives was studied. The triplet state lifetimes of the thionated PBIs are substantially shortened (0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) as compared to the unsubstituted PBI (ca. 130 &#181;s).

&lt;p&gt;We found the triplet state lifetime becomes shorter (ca. 0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) with thionation of the carbonyl groups in the PBI chromophore (ca. 127 &#181;s). Both theoretical computation and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra demonstrate the enhanced spin orbit coupling (SOC) upon thionation. Intersystem crossing was observed for dianion of the thionated PBIs, and the triplet state lifetime (18&#8211;85 &#181;s) are long, thus the photoexcited dianions with ISC ability can be used as strong electron donor (the oxidation potential is &#8722;1.47 to &#8722;1.77&#160;V versus Fc/Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in photocatalytic redox organic reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thionation induced intersystem crossing (ISC) in perylenebisimide (PBI) derivatives was studied. The triplet state lifetimes of the thionated PBIs are substantially shortened (0.12&#8211;0.78 &#181;s) as compared to the unsubstituted PBI (ca. 130 &#181;s). Moreover, there is a clear trend of shortening of the triplet excited state lifetimes and the degree of thionation of the carbonyl groups in PBI. These findings rationalize the previous report of the contradictory lower &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum yields for the PBI derivatives with more carbonyl groups thionated. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectral study shows that the zero field splitting parameters &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; (1625&#8211;1992&#160;MHz) of the lowest triplet states of thionated PBI are larger than that of the pristine PBI chromophore (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1166&#160;MHz), which is attributed to the influence of sulfur atoms. Interestingly, the electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of the TREPR spectra is inverted at longer delay time.

         <title>Uncovering the Photochemical Conversion of Atmospheric Chlorinated Organics on Mineral Dust: In&#8208;Field Evidence of a New Source of Dioxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining in&#8208;field experiment, laboratory simulations, and theoretical calculations, this work identifies a new pathway of photochemical conversion of atmospheric chlorinated organics into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans on mineral dust particulates, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial chlorinated organics and their secondary transformation particulates in the atmosphere.








Abstract
Hazardous chemicals are typically assessed based on their inherent toxicity, often neglecting the fact that their atmospheric secondary transformation products may exhibit increased toxicity and persistence, potentially exceeding the risks associated with the parent chemicals. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) are a significant class of commercial chemicals, but their secondary conversion in the atmosphere remains largely unknown. Herein, by combining laboratory and in&#8208;field experiments, we have identified a new conversion pathway that the CVOCs can be photochemically transformed into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) on mineral dust particulates under atmospheric conditions. We showed that mineral components, particularly Fe&#8208; and Al&#8208;related oxides, can efficiently convert monochlorobenzene, dichloromethane, and perchloroethylene into PCDD/Fs under light irradiation. By combing reaction product measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that the &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 exhibited much higher propensity for dioxin formation than &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, as evidenced by its lower reaction energy barriers for both the initial phenol formation and subsequent chlorination processes. In particular, histopathological assays showed the photochemically&#8208;reacted &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 can cause severe damage to the lung and brain tissues of mice, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial CVOCs and their secondary transformation products.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Driven Exploration of Surface Reconstructions of Reduced Rutile TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials, integrated with active learning, reveal novel reduced surface reconstructions of rutile TiO2 (110). These include subsurface shear plane structures, verified experimentally. Theoretical and experimental insights into structural, electronic, and catalytic properties highlight their implications in catalysis.








Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as a catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active&#8208;learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results by comparing experimental and theoretical high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Filler with Anion&#8208;Constrained Centers in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designed cationic imidazolium&#8208;based units to prepare PAF&#8208;142 containing anion&#8208;constrained centers and fast diffusion channels for Li+, thus facilitating the dissociation of Li+ and its rapid transport. The composite polymer electrolyte PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE, exhibited high Li+ conductivity and remarkable suppression of lithium dendrite formation, achieving excellent long cycle stability.








Abstract
The widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) based on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is hindered by their low Li+ conductivity and safety risks posed by the growth of lithium dendrites. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we designed a cationic porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;142) and introduced it as a filler into SPEs to obtain a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE. The cationic imidazolium sites could effectively constrain the movement of anions through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the design of the imidazolium&#8208;based building units allowed the cationic sites to be located within the framework, which promoted the transport of Li+. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which PAF&#8208;142 promoted the dissociation of lithium salts and enhanced Li+ transport. Benefiting from these advantages, the Li+ conductivity of quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (QCPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE reached 8.77&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. Additionally, a stable interface with abundant inorganic components was formed between PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE and the lithium electrode, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, thereby achieving stable long cycle of the Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//Li cell for more than 8500&#160;h. The Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//LFP cell demonstrated excellent cycle life exceeding 1400 cycles. This study proposes a promising SPEs performance&#8208;enhancing solution, advancing cutting&#8208;edge lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters Through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydroheteroarylation of Cyclopentenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iridium catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective C&#9472;H addition of diverse heterocycles including furan, benzofuran, thiophene, and indole to cyclic alkenes. This process occurs diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively, delivering enantioenriched cyclopentane structures containing 1,3&#8208;tertiary&#8211;tertiary and 1,3&#8208;quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8211;catalyzed direct addition of (hetero)aryl C&#9472;H bond to an alkene provides an expedited route to construct benzylic stereocenter from readily available arene and alkene feedstocks with complete atom&#8208;economy.

&lt;p&gt;We report an iridium catalyzed regio- and enantioselective C&#9472;H addition of diverse heterocycles including furan, benzofuran, thiophene, and indole to cyclic alkenes. This process occurs diastereo- and enantioselectively, delivering enantioenriched cyclopentane structures containing 1,3-tertiary&#8211;tertiary and 1,3-quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal&#8211;catalyzed direct addition of (hetero)aryl C&#9472;H bond to an alkene provides an expedited route to construct benzylic stereocenter from readily available arene and alkene feedstocks with complete atom-economy. However, creation of more than one stereocenter through enantioselective C&#9472;H (hetero)arylation remains a challenging goal. Here we report an iridium-catalyzed desymmetric hydroheteroarylation of cyclopentenes to construct 1,3-nonadjacent stereocenters. A series of heteroaryl C&#9472;H bonds were cleaved site-selectively and added regio- and enantioselectively to an unactivated alkene containing an amide coordinating group, delivering valuable enantioenriched cyclopentane scaffolds containing 1,3-tertiary&#8211;tertiary or 1,3-quaternary&#8211;tertiary stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Based &#8220;Transfer Stations&#8221; at Carbon&#8208;Immobilized Metal Particles Enable Rapid Hydrogen Transfer for Efficient Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct engineering of metal&#8208;solution interaction by &#9472;NH2 modified metal sites is demonstrated for boosting the formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an &#9472;NH2 modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production.








Abstract
The interaction of surface metal species with the solution plays a key role in engineering heterogeneous catalytic processes. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of L&#8208;histidine&#8208;coordinated PdAg nanoparticles (4.03&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08&#160;nm) anchored on pristine carbon supports (denoted as PdAg&#8208;NH2/C) and their use for formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). Significant acceleration of FAD related to the histidine is observed, and the enhancement mechanism is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The presence of L&#8208;histidine at metal sites promotes rapid binding of formic acid molecules due to acid&#8211;base interactions. The local enrichment of both protons and formate at the metal&#8208;solution interfaces promotes the subsequent formate decomposition and hydride transfer to the metal surface. The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an amino modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production. The optimal Pd1Ag1&#8208;NH2/C catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 6493.5&#160;h&#8722;1 at 333&#160;K based on the total amount of Pd, together with an H2 selectivity of 100%. This study emphasizes the critical role of optimizing local transport pathways near catalytic centers chemically and further provides insights into the rational development of heterogeneous catalysts for FAD technologies.

         <title>Modulating Electron Transfer via Cerium Photocatalysis for Alkoxy Radical&#8208;Mediated Selective Hydroetherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct coupling of free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes&#8212;a longstanding challenge due to inherent polarity mismatches&#8212;is achieved via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform featuring cerium(IV) benzoate catalysts. This anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroetherification proceeds through selective activation of free alcohols into alkoxy radicals, facilitated by LMCT homolysis, even in the presence of redox&#8208;labile electron&#8208;rich alkenes such as enol ethers. Mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate complex, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation.








Abstract
We present a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform utilizing cerium(IV) benzoate complexes to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of directly coupling free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes, overcoming inherent polarity mismatches. This approach effectively circumvents the typical selectivity in single&#8208;electron transfer processes, enabling the selective generation of electrophilic alkoxy radicals from free alcohols in the presence of redox&#8208;labile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The Ce&#8208;benzoate&#8208;based photocatalytic protocol promotes regioselective hydroetherification via both intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular addition pathways, showcasing broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and versatility across a diverse array of alkenes, including silyl enol ethers and enamides/enecarbamates. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate catalyst, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation, thereby establishing a practical and atom&#8208;economical framework for hydroetherification.

         <title>A General Strategy for Enhanced Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging Through Intramolecular Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging through the development of intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) cassettes, optimizing both photostability and photon budget. The cassettes, incorporating rhodamine as the donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as the acceptor, achieve an impressive 94.8% energy transfer efficiency and a 670% increase in survival time compared to rhodamine alone at the single&#8208;molecule level.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule imaging demands fluorophores with exceptional photostability and photon budget. This study presents an intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) strategy to enhance these critical properties. We developed xanthene&#8208;based IMET cassettes by covalently linking donor and acceptor, achieving significant improvements in single&#8208;molecule imaging performance. While extensive spectral overlap is generally beneficial in bulk systems, single&#8208;molecule imaging necessitates careful optimization to minimize direct acceptor excitation at the high excitation powers typically used. Our optimized cassettes, featuring rhodamine as donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as acceptor, exhibit 94.8% energy transfer efficiency. This configuration effectively minimizes direct excitation&#8208;induced acceptor bleaching, as 94.9% of molecules exhibit donor photobleaching prior to acceptor photobleaching. This efficient energy management leads to a 670% enhancement in photostability, arising from the competition between IMET and photobleaching pathways, which effectively channels excitation energy away from photo&#8208;destructive processes. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that IMET occurs on a picosecond timescale, significantly faster than both fluorescence relaxation (nanoseconds) and photobleaching (seconds). Notably, these IMET cassettes demonstrated superior performance in single&#8208;molecule tracking applications, including on supported lipid bilayers and in live&#8208;cell tracking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dynamics, highlighting the broad potential of the IMET strategy for advancing single&#8208;molecule imaging.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Mass Transfer Toward Industrial Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalytic process that bridges the inherent gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, thereby overcoming the barrier for the migration of reactant ions to catalytic sites. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH and formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated water electrolysis.








Abstract
The rapid migration of reactive ions across the electrolyte&#8211;catalytic sites interface is crucial in various catalytic processes. Herein, we introduce hydrogen bonds to bridge the intrinsic gap at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, mediating the diffusion of hydroxide ions. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH, wherein the oxygen atom within the oxyanions established hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules in the electrolyte. Operando spectroscopy indicated that both water electrolysis activity and hydroxide concentration exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped dependence on the electrostatic potential of functionalized group, which formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalysis. The sulfate&#8208;modified NiCo OOH achieved an ultralow energy consumption of 4.23&#160;kWh m&#8722;3 H2 in the industrial electrolyzers, predicting that the electricity consumption can be reduced by 16&#160;000&#160;TWh.

         <title>Cyclization Polymerization of Elemental Sulfur and Diisocyanate: New Polymerization Toward High&#8208;Performance Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a new polymerization reaction, cyclization polymerization of aliphatic diisocyanate with elemental sulfur. It is the first report about directly converting elemental sulfur and isocyanate into a high&#8208;performance polymer. The polymer exhibits remarkably strong adhesion to a variety of substrates either in air or underwater.








Abstract
The development of polymer materials heavily relies on new polymerization reactions. Herein, we report the discovery of cyclization polymerization of element sulfur (S8) and aliphatic diisocyanate at room temperature with 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) organic base as the catalyst, where the two monomers are covalently linked via the formation of thiadiazolidinone (TDZD) or a cyclic isocyanurate ring. The polymer of S8 and 1,6&#8208;diisocyanatohexane (HDI) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and mechanical properties. Particularly, it has exceptionally high adhesion to various substrates in air or under water, e.g., the underwater adhesion strength is as high as &#8764;26.5&#160;MPa for poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PETG) and &#8764;2.3&#160;MPa for poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon). The cyclization polymerization provides the basis for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance polymers with elemental sulfur.

         <title>Mixing and Matching of Hybrid Megasynthases is a Hub for the Evolution of Metabolic Diversity in Cyanobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Natural combinatorics: Evolutionary mixing and matching of three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters resulted in the emergence of minutumamides, a novel family of peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids. Retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis led to the discovery of nostopeptolide KVJ3, an evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis and sheds light on cluster mixing as a widespread strategy in the evolution of metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Modular megasynthases, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), are molecular assembly lines that biosynthesize many pharmaceutically and ecologically important natural products. Understanding how these compounds evolve could inspire the artificial evolution of compound diversity by metabolic engineering. Over the past two decades, a number of seminal studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of natural product evolution. However, the evolution of NRPS and PKS assembly lines remains poorly understood, especially for NRPS/PKS hybrids. Here, we provide substantial evidence for a remarkable cluster&#8208;mixing event involving three cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), resulting in the emergence of novel peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids that were named minutumamides. By combining retro&#8208;evolutionary analysis with structure&#8208;guided genome mining, we could discover a potential evolutionary ancestor that links nostopeptolide and minutumamide biosynthesis. In addition, we were able to trace nostopeptolide&#8208;related module and domain blocks in various other biosynthetic pathways, indicating a surprisingly vivid mixing and matching of biosynthesis genes in the evolution of NRPS and cis&#8208;acyltransferase PKS/NRPS pathways, which was previously regarded as a unique feature of trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS. These remarkable insights into the evolutionary plasticity of NRPS&#8208;PKS assembly lines provide valuable guidance for pathway engineers looking for productive combinations that yield &#8220;nonnatural&#8221; hybrid natural products.

         <title>Why Does the Performance of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalysts Decrease in Acidic Conditions?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts proceeds through electron injection into the &#960;* orbital, triggered by the hydrogenation of pyridinic nitrogen. By closely tracking the changes in the electronic state during the reaction, we have reported that the decrease in ORR activity in acidic electrolytes is due to the protonation of pyridinic nitrogen, which precedes its hydrogenation.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has emerged as a promising low&#8208;cost and durable alternative to platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, its catalytic activity decreases significantly in acidic electrolytes, limiting the practical applications. Here, we report the degradation mechanisms of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, focusing on the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N), which serves the primary active site. We found that the electrochemical hydrogenation of pyri&#8208;N to pyri&#8208;NH, coupled with oxygen adsorption, is a critical process. Although this reaction occurs at higher potentials in basic electrolytes, it shifts to lower potentials in acidic environments due to the protonation and stabilization of pyri&#8208;N. These results demonstrate that the decrease of the catalytic activity in acidic electrolytes is tied to the basicity of pyri&#8208;N. By controlling the basicity of pyri&#8208;N, specifically its pKa, a guideline for enhancing the ORR and other electrode reactions has been established.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing and Interfacial Contact via Halogenated N&#8208;Glycidyl Carbazole Small Molecules for Low Energy Loss and Highly Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;based small molecules with different halogen atoms not only reduced the carrier transport energy barrier and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss through self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions, but also regulated perovskite crystal growth, providing a minimal energy barrier of 0.10&#160;eV, an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%, and an exceptional power conversion efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%).








Abstract
Nonideal interfacial contact and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) limit their further development. Herein, two carbazole&#8208;based molecules with different halogen atoms (X&#8208;OCZ, X = Cl or Br) are developed as efficient interfacial regulators. The halogen effect not only finely modulates the molecular packing, crystallinity, and surface contact potential of the MeO&#8208;2PACz analogue via self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions but also significantly influences the subsequent crystal growth of perovskite, thus resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity, improved energy level alignment, and depressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Importantly, the Cl&#8208;OCZ&#8208;mediated device exhibits a minimal interfacial carrier transport energy barrier of 0.10&#160;eV and an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%. Moreover, the target device (aperture area: 0.09 cm2) shows an exceptional efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%) along with enhanced thermal and operational stability. The strategy is also extended to large area devices, delivering efficiencies of 25.0% for a 1&#160;cm2 device and 22.9% for a 12.96&#160;cm2 minimodule. This study highlights the halogen role of interfacial small molecules in optimizing molecular packing and interfacial contact toward highly efficient PSCs with minimized energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination.

We present transient hydrogel adhesives driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface, which collects high&#8208;quality electrophysiological signals on hairy skins without hair removal. The autonomous liquefication of hydrogel adhesives allows easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any damages to hairy skins and electrode.








Abstract
Hydrogel adhesives have many important applications in the fields of drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and bioelectronics. The detachment of hydrogel adhesives under the benign conditions is vital to the definitive surgical repair and implanted devices. Although stimuli&#8208;mediated detachment of hydrogel adhesives has been achieved, it is still a grand challenge to develop a transient adhesive with programmable adhesion and autonomous detachment from the substrate, especially the hairy skins. Here, we report a transient hydrogel adhesive driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface. The transient hydrogel shows tunable mechanical properties, adjustable adhesive strength, and autonomous sol&#8208;gel&#8208;sol transition with a programmable lifetime. Moreover, the transient hydrogel adhesive enables conformable and stable adhesion to various materials. In particular, the bioelectrode coated by the transient hydrogel adhesive allows to record stable and high&#8208;quality electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram signals directly on the hairy skins without hair shaving. Notably, the autonomous liquefication of the hydrogel adhesives enables the easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any noticeable damages to the hairy skins and electrode. This work paves a new avenue in the innovative development of hydrogel adhesives for the conformable and detachable bioelectronic interface.

         <title>Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuth oxychloride material with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield due to overcoming confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect. 








Abstract
During photocatalytic nitrogen fixation for ammonia synthesis, the photo&#8208;Dember effect causes direct transmission of photogenerated electrons from the illuminated surface to the bottom of photocatalyst, thus significantly reducing the number of charge carriers migrating on the surface and nitrogen fixation efficiency. Herein, a bismuth oxychloride material with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) is synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield of 591.94&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) after photocatalytic N2 reduction under simulated solar light irradiation. The designed (101)/(001) interface in BOC(101)&#8208;OVs generates a self&#8208;built electric field (Eself) on the material surface due to different atomic arrangements. Therefore, the newly developed material achieved &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing the transfer path, i.e., from bulk phase transfer to surface lateral transfer path, thus escaping confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect. Meanwhile, after OVs construction, each adsorbed N2 molecule simultaneously bonds with three Bi atoms of material through N 2p&#8211;Bi 6p bonding, accelerating the filling of high&#8208;energy electrons into the &#960;* orbital of N2, leading to a new nitrogen reduction path with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation. This study greatly advances the beneficial effect of charge carrier migration through overcoming the photo&#8208;Dember effect for ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Hydroxylation of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene Coupled with Short Chain Branching Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation enables C&#9472;H hydroxylation of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) along with the growth of methyl and ethyl short&#8208;chain branches. Fluorine on the ligand enhances the interaction with LDPE while facilitating hydrogen peroxide activation. The growth of short&#8208;chain branches occurs via &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. The oxidized LDPE exhibits significantly improved mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely used in packaging applications, but after being discarded its environmental impact is a pressing concern due to a lack of effective chemical recycling strategies, especially owing to its chemical inertness and nonpolar nature. To address these challenges, we present a mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative upcycling of LDPE in which C&#9472;H hydroxylation of LDPE occurs coupled with the growth of methyl short chain branching (Me&#8208;SCB) and ethyl shortchain branching (Et&#8208;SCB). As a result, the resulting products achieve significant improvements in surface wettability, crystallinity, and mechanical properties despite a concomitant reduction in molecular weight. CH&#8230;F interactions and &#963;&#8211;&#960; interactions are found between LDPE and the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the catalytic mechanism that fluorine on the ligand facilitates hydrogen peroxide activation and subsequent deprotonation, leading to the formation of high&#8208;valent ironoxo species. The growth of short&#8208;chain branching (SCB) involves the &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. This work represents a transformative advancement in deep understanding of polyolefin upcycling and opens a new approach of polyolefin functionalization and architecture modulation.

         <title>Probing the Catalytic Degradation of Unsaturated Polyolefin Materials via Fe&#8208;Based Lewis Acids&#8208;Initiated Carbonyl&#8211;Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic degradation of unsaturated polyolefins using iron&#8208;based Lewis acids in solution was systematically studied. This carbonyl&#8211;olefin cross&#8208;metathesis strategy was proved to be highly effective in cleaving polymers containing carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds into short segments, even basic molecules for other compounds, e.g., pharmaceutical synthesis, confirming its universal applicability.








Abstract
Degradation and recyclability of polymeric materials, including extensively used polyolefins, are becoming increasingly necessary. Chemically stable saturated polyolefin backbones make their degradation frustratingly challenging. The current effective strategy is to create cleavable defects, e.g., C&#9552;C double bonds along the backbone, and subsequently depolymerize them via cross&#8208;metathesis reaction with olefins. High&#8208;value chemicals or reusable polymeric segments are obtained. This two&#8208;step protocol provides operable means for alleviating plastics problems. There are several approaches to introduce unsaturation into a polymer backbone, like dehydrogenation or copolymerization of olefins and conjugated dienes. However, for the second step, to conduct a cross&#8208;metathesis reaction, only noble metal catalysts can be used most of the time. Regardless of their limited availability, the fact that these organometallics are unfavorably sensitive to impurities would raise barriers in industrial practices. Herein we employed earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive iron&#8208;based Lewis acids to initiate carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis reactions between ketone/aldehyde reagents and unsaturated polyolefins. After explorations in poly(diene)s and industrial thermoplastic elastomers, we extended this protocol to degrade low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). Low&#8208;molecular weight PE wax&#8208;like products were obtained as useful chemicals. This catalytic degradation system is expected to enable the development of more efficient metathesis strategies to promote degradation of polyolefins and pave sustainable ways for reuse of polymeric materials.

         <title>Pore Engineering in Isoreticular Titanium&#8208;Isophthalate Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we designed titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination polymers with functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. We conducted extensive investigations to explore how pore engineering influences adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings address the synthesis challenge of isostructural Ti&#8208;coordination polymers and offer insights into structure&#8211;property relationships through modulation of their chemical environments.








Abstract
Pore engineering through chemical environment modification is vital for developing industrial porous materials. Understanding the effects of substitutions in isoreticular porous coordination polymers&#8212;such as steric hindrance, vibrational capabilities, electronic influences, and hydropathy&#8212;is key to elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. However, accurately assessing the impact of functional groups on properties remains challenging due to limitations in current methodologies. In this study, we designed a series of titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination&#8208;polymers with various functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. The unique spatial arrangement and electronic distribution of isophthalate and its functional groups provide an ideal platform to address these challenges. We conducted extensive investigations combining experimental methods with computational simulations to explore how pore engineering affects adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings not only tackle the synthesis challenge of isostructural titanium&#8208;coordination polymers but also offer new insights into understanding structure&#8211;property relationships achieved through modulation of their chemical environments.

In this study, we designed a series of titanium-isophthalate coordination-polymers with various functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. The unique spatial arrangement and electronic distribution of isophthalate and its functional groups provide an ideal platform to address these challenges. We conducted extensive investigations combining experimental methods with computational simulations to explore how pore engineering affects adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings not only tackle the synthesis challenge of isostructural titanium-coordination polymers but also offer new insights into understanding structure&#8211;property relationships achieved through modulation of their chemical environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Sourced 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dithiolanes for Recyclable Poly(disulfide)s with High Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis was developed to access aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers. The resulting aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability and stability, as well as a range of desirable thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, showing potential toward sustainable materials.








Abstract
The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#9472;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.

The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutics. Here, we present an ultrasensitive single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy assay combined with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics to study membrane permeabilization in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs).








Abstract
Cell membrane disruption is associated with numerous diseases and underlies the activity of various antimicrobial agents. The rapid screening of compounds capable of disrupting or permeabilizing biological membranes is essential to the search for new therapeutic drugs. Here, we present a single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy assay integrated with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics to study membrane permeabilization in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing as few as seven dye molecules. This assay eliminates the need for liposome immobilization and achieves detection rates in the range of 1000 vesicles per minute, offering unparalleled sensitivity and detection limits as low as 135 pM, corresponding to just eight permeabilizing molecules per vesicle for active compounds such as ionomycin. It provides a robust platform for investigating membrane&#8208;disrupting agents, including those with antimicrobial properties or implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>In Situ Cation Exchange Enables Air&#8208;Processed Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with over 25% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ cation exchange strategies were utilized to fabricate a PbI&#8322; shell on perovskite surfaces, improving crystallinity, the energy level alignment, and reducing defects of perovskite films. The devices fabricated in ambient air could achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% with excellent stability under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I protocols. 








Abstract
The scalable fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) in humid air with an antisolvent&#8208;free process is essential for future industrial applications. However, high humidity poses significant challenges for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films, making it difficult to attain efficient IPSCs under ambient conditions. Here, we present an in situ cation exchange strategy to create a compact and uniform PbI&#8322; shell on the perovskite surface by using ZnI&#8322; in acetonitrile (ACN), where Zn2+ replaces Pb2+. This transformation is attributed to the surface defects of the perovskite, which undergo a cation exchange reaction in humid air, forming a compact PbI&#8322; shell. The n&#8208;type PbI&#8322; shell effectively encapsulates the perovskite films, minimizing air exposure while optimizing energy level alignment, thereby enhancing electron transport and extraction. As a result, we demonstrate IPSCs with efficiencies of 25.2% under ambient conditions (25&#176;&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C, 60%&#160;&#177;&#160;10% relative humidity [RH]), on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices fabricated in inert atmospheres. The devices demonstrated remarkable stability, enduring aging tests under the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I for over 4770 and 2000&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Unnatural Triggers Converted From Tetrazine&#8208;Attached Sialic Acid for Activation of Optoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazine precursors (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold are rationally designed and synthesized, which can be efficiently converted into unnatural tetrazine (Tz) triggers on cancer cell surfaces via metabolic glycoengineering. These Tz triggers activate theranostic agents for multispectral optoacoustic tomographic (MSOT) imaging, enabling localization and image&#8208;guided therapy of orthotopic and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Constructing chemical groups on cell membranes through metabolic glycoengineering of unnatural sugars is an effective means to solve the issue of insufficient or even lack of targets in cancer theranostics. Herein, we address the limitations by developing a tetrazine precursor (SiaTz) based on a nonO&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold and then utilizing it to create unnatural tetrazine triggers on the surface of cancer cells. SiaTz exhibits a good balance between the stability and reaction kinetics under physiological conditions and can be efficiently converted into corresponding tetrazine trigger through bypassing several size&#8208;limiting steps in metabolic glycoengineering process. We also prepare a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept theranostic combination of a trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivative (CyTCO) and a thermal&#8208;sensitive drug 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane]&#8208;dihydrochloride (AIPH) to verify the activation function of tetrazine triggers in theranostics of orthotopic and metastatic tumors. In the presence of tetrazine triggers, CyTCO can be activated via bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction to induce optoacoustic signal enhancement, enabling high&#8208;contrast diagnostic imaging and precise tumor localization to guide subsequent treatments. Tetrazine trigger&#8208;activated CyTCO displays high photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, which can cause an obvious increase in temperature under laser irradiation and then initiate AIPH decomposition to produce toxic radicals for combined therapy.

         <title>Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C with High&#8208;Density Atomically Dispersed Mn Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;step incorporation of manganese into the nitrogen&#8211;carbon materials results in an atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with a high Mn density. This strategy promotes Mn content and anti&#8208;demetallization, enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability. After 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave potential cycles, the fuel cell retains 81.6% of its initial peak power density.








Abstract
The utilization of transition metal&#8211;based catalysts as alternatives presents an attractive solution for enhancing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and reducing costly platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. Manganese&#8208;based nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C) is anticipated to exhibit durability due to its weaker Fenton reaction propensity. However, a key obstacle lies in boosting intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and increasing the density of Mn active sites, crucial for practical integration into fuel cell operations. Herein, a three&#8208;step method is developed to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C materials with a rich mesoporous structure as highly effective ORR catalysts. The high Mn loading (3.42 wt%) promotes the generation of Duo&#8208;MnN4 active sites, demonstrating outstanding performance and durability for fuel cells. Specifically, the exceptional performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) reaches 649&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC) achieves 770&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Notably, the durability of the Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst in PEMFC is reported for the first time, showing only 18.4% decay after 30&#160;000 square&#8208;wave cycles. This work provides a unique perspective and a systematic design strategy for building feasible nonprecious metal catalysts with a high active site density, addressing the challenges of inefficiency and performance limitations across various electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;Free Organic/Inorganic Interphase for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) is proposed as an additive for achieving aqueous Zn batteries combining performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness, which not only modulates the Zn2+ solvation structure but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of an F&#8208;free organic (zinc chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer. 








Abstract
Construction of robust solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) has proved effective in mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions of zinc (Zn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Fluorinated SEIs, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional electrochemical stability and high Zn2+ conductivity. However, the formation of such SEIs typically relies on the use of fluorine (F)&#8208;containing precursors, which inadvertently raise environmental and biological concerns because they show high resistance to degradation in natural environments. Herein, we develop an F&#8208;free organic/inorganic hybrid SEI for aqueous Zn batteries using a low&#8208;cost N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) electrolyte additive. The NAG additive not only modulates the solvation structure of Zn2+ but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of a robust organic (Zn chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer, thereby enhancing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and Zn plating/stripping reversibility. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8210;2, and greatly extended cycling stability in full cells (up to 2000 cycles). Our electrolyte design paves a promising avenue toward practical Zn batteries that combine performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness.

         <title>Adaptive Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S Clusters: Consistent Redox Behavior Versus Reversible Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters containing structurally analogous or differentiated cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in distinct oxidation states have been synthesized, which prove to be chemically interconvertible. The analysis of the strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained from the solution of these clusters indicates that they are electrochemically interconvertible through either reversible or irreversible pathways. This work provides a reference on how Fe&#8208;S/Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters mediate the electron transfer processes through redox&#8208;adaptive structural transformations.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are critical in a number of important biological processes, where their structural integrity can be maintained or reversibly transformed. However, it remains ambiguous how Fe&#8208;S clusters adapt to electrochemical demands for electron transport through redox&#8208;induced structural transformations. In this study, three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters comprising similar or distinct cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in different oxidation states have been synthesized. These chemically interconvertible clusters exhibit strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, irrespective of the structural differences in the core. Subsequent investigations indicate that the chloride ligand in cluster 2 is spontaneously replaced by the solvent molecule in solution and therefore only the solvent&#8208;ligated species exhibits an observable redox behavior that is almost identical to that of the chloride&#8208;free clusters 3 and 4. A comprehensive analysis of the redox behavior suggests that the intriguing redox events in the CV curves can be correlated to the electrochemical transformations between the chloride&#8208;free clusters. This work provides an insight into how Fe&#8208;S clusters maintain a stable redox behavior through structural transformations that can facilitate electron transfer in certain cases.

         <title>Leaching&#8208;Induced Ti Trapping Stabilizes Amorphous IrOx for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir/TiN evolves into Ti&#8208;trapped IrOx, owing to the TiN leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect under long&#8208;term oxygen evolution conditions, which helps to stabilize the Ir(III) and lattice oxygen sites on the amorphous IrOx while realizing self&#8208;thickening of the ultrathin catalyst layer in the realistic device, benefiting low&#8208;Ir based water electrolysis.








Abstract
Transition metal nitrides are promising conductive support materials in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas it is unclear if their electrochemical oxidation during prolonged test would affect the OER catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that the leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect from TiN supports effectively stabilizes the electrochemically oxidized amorphous IrOx catalyst. Structural characterizations reveal that the TiN support experiences severe leaching during OER test, leaving minor amounts of Ti&#8211;O species trapping on IrOx clusters, which mitigate the overoxidation of Ir(III) species and elongate the Ir&#8211;O bonds. This leads to 70% reduction of lattice oxygen oxidation and the substantially reduced Ir leaching. Additionally, self&#8208;thickening of the catalyst layers is found during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), enabling an ultralow catalyst loading of 87 &#181;gIr cm&#8722;2 to obtain a stable operation at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. This work deepens the understanding of TiN&#8208;supported catalysts for long&#8208;term stable OER electrocatalysis.

Bis(alkynyl)boranes bearing different B&#8208;substituents reacted with Cp*2Ti(Me3SiCCSiMe3), leading to the formation of B&#9472;C activation products (top right) and C&#9472;H activation products (bottom right), respectively.








Abstract
Reactions between Rosenthal's titanocene (Cp2Ti) and decamethyltitanocene (Cp*2Ti) synthons with various bis(alkynyl)boranes were investigated. A series of titanium&#8208;fused boracyclobutenes were obtained through the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)2NB(CCR)2 or PhB(CCPh)2. This represents the first realization of approaching this structural motif via the rearrangement of bis(alkynyl)boranes within the coordination sphere of a d&#8208;block metal. These findings break the previous limitation that the boron substituent must be an amino group. Furthermore, the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)PhNB(CCPh)2 or (Mes2B)PhNB(CCPh)2 (Mes&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) led to the formation of novel tethered metallocene complexes, in which the titanacyclopentadiene structure is linked to one of the cyclopentadienyl groups via a &#9472;CH2&#9472;BR&#9472; bridge. Both experimental and theoretical studies provided insights into an unprecedented reaction mechanism. The process involves the initial formation of an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated bis(alkynyl)borane intermediate, which was detected and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This intermediate subsequently undergoes either B&#9472;Calkynyl bond activation or CMe&#9472;H activation of the Cp* ligand, leading to the formation of two distinct types of products.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomative Epoxidation of Naphthalenes with Aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective epoxidation of naphthalenes into their corresponding arene oxides with aqueous hydrogen peroxide is described. The reaction combines dearomatization with installation of chemically versatile functionality in an enantioselective manner. Chemo and enantioselectivity relies in the synergy of a novel e&#8208;rich and sterically encumbered manganese catalyst and amino acids featuring tert&#8208;butyl leucine moiety as coligands. 








Abstract
Arenes are abundantly occurring molecules of significant interest as versatile starting materials in organic reactions. Typically, oxidation of arenes yields planar molecules such as phenols and quinones. However, several iron dependent oxygenases can disrupt the aromaticity of arenes through oxidation and introduce C(sp3)&#9472;O stereogenic centers, resulting in precious enantioenriched epoxide or diol products. Emulating this enzymatic behavior with synthetic catalysts has met little success until now. Herein we describe a catalytic chemo&#8208; and enantioselective dearomative epoxidation of naphthalenes. The singular chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity features of the reaction critically rely on a manganese catalyst that combines electron donating groups and steric demand on the ligand and activates hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions and short reaction times. Assisted with an N&#8208;protected amino acid, this catalyst epoxidizes a range of naphthalenes providing chemically versatile diepoxides in moderate to good yields and high levels of enantioselectivity. Straightforward elaboration gives diverse access to densely functionalized 3D structurally rich oxygenated molecules. The reaction constitutes a paradigmatical example of expedient access to stereochemically rich, valuable oxygenated molecules from readily available feedstocks, enabled by highly reactive yet selective biologically inspired oxidation catalysts.

A cationic Ir(I)&#8208;complex modified with the chiral diphosphine DM&#8208;SEGPHOS mediates the hydroalkylation of diverse &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes with N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives. The processes occur with complete branched selectivity and high enantioselectivity. Styrenes possessing higher &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituents also participate to provide the targets with moderate to excellent levels of diastereoselectivity. The products are readily advanced to &#946;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are inaccessible or cumbersome to access by other means. In broader terms, the study demonstrates how catalyst controlled C&#9472;H additions across alkenes can be used to execute the by&#8208;product&#8208;free construction of contiguous acyclic trisubstituted and quaternary centers.

         <title>Influence of Ligand Design and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Butyrolactone Using Salan and Salalen Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>

Polyhydroxybutyrates are key sustainable polyesters, but controlling the stereoregularity is crucial for exhibiting the most promising thermal and mechanical properties. Highly active rare&#8208;earth metal salan/salalen complexes yield isotactic (Pm up to 0.96 at 0 &#176;C) or syndioenriched (Pr up to 0.91) PHB, depending on the steric demand of the ligand and non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) in the catalytic system. 








Abstract
We herein report the influence of the ligand framework on the isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;butyrolactone using highly active in situ generated salan [ONNO]H2 and salalen [ONNO]H rare&#8208;earth metal complexes. The stereochemistry was found to be highly dependent on the ortho&#8208;substituents, enabling the synthesis of either isotactic poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (up to Pm&#160;=&#160;0.92) or syndiotactic PHB (up to Pr&#160;=&#160;0.91). To obtain further information on the mechanism of the isoselective ROP, which exhibits an enantiomorphic site control (ESC), a new hybrid Y[ONNO]H(N(SiHMe2)2)(THF) complex was isolated and characterized via NMR, DFT, and mass&#8208;spectrometry experiments. The impact of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) was demonstrated by the addition of NCI inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed a secondary kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) of 1.14, indicating that the pre&#8208;coordination of the monomer plays a significant role in the mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for the future design of catalysts for isoselective ROP.

         <title>Cooperative Iron&#8211;Aluminium Reactivity for Dinitrogen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen activation was achieved through cooperative bimetallic reactivity of a Fe&#9472;Al system, which features flexible, covalent metal&#8211;metal bonding, and captures two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Subsequent alkylation of the Al site leads to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex that facilitates the silylation of the terminal N atom. 








Abstract
We report a novel bimetallic approach utilizing cooperative Fe&#9472;Al reactivity for N2 activation on the Cp*Fe(1,2&#8208;Cy2PC6H4AlEt) platform, effectively capturing two N2 molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination. Characterizations of the N2&#8208;bridged Fe&#9472;Al dimer (2) using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy coupled to density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals its electronic structure as a resonance hybrid between Fe(II)&#8208;Al(I) and Fe(0)&#8208;Al(III). The flexible, covalent Fe&#9472;Al bonding facilitates the subsequent alkylation of the Al site with nBuLi, leading to the formation of a dinitrogen&#8208;lithiated complex (3) that enables the silylation of the terminal N atom. Our findings highlight the significance of leveraging Fe&#9472;Al effects as an electron buffer to achieve facile N2 activation.

&lt;p&gt;Dinitrogen activation was achieved through cooperative bimetallic reactivity of a Fe&#9472;Al system, which features flexible, covalent metal&#8211;metal bonding, and captures two N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules through intermolecular Fe&#9472;N&#8801;N&#9472;Al coordination.

         <title>A Sustainable and Scalable Approach for In Situ Induction of Gradient Nucleation Sites in Biomass&#8208;Derived Interface Layers for Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

A biomass&#8208;based Cu2+&#8208;carboxymethyl chitosan&#8208;kaolin (CuCK) layer composed of in situ galvanically and galvanostatically induced gradient alloy nucleation sites to achieve durable Zn anodes (Zn@CuCK) is designed, which significantly enhances adhesion to the Zn anode, demonstrates abundant zincophilicity, promotes continuous vertical zinc deposition with high plating/stripping reversibility, regulates Zn2+ flux, and facilitates Zn2+ transfer and desolvation. This study provides a sustainable and scalable method to in situ induce gradient nucleation sites in interface layer for engineering durable Zn anodes, promising for practical aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;grid energy storage due to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and durability. However, challenges like dendrite growth, corrosion, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the zinc anode hinder their performance. Herein, we propose a sustainable and scalable approach to form a copper gluconate@carboxymethyl chitosan@kaolin (CuCK) interface layer, inducing gradient nucleation sites via in situ galvanic and galvanostatic processes. The biomass&#8208;based CuCK coating features a gradient CuxZny alloy structure that homogenizes interfacial electric field distribution and enhances electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the incorporated Cu2+&#8208;loaded kaolin and carboxymethyl chitosan regulate Zn2+ flux, accelerate Zn2+ desolvation, and suppress HER. The resulting Zn@CuCK anode achieves a high cumulative capacity of 5500&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, exhibits excellent durability in Zn@CuCK//NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells across a wide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 60&#160;&#176;C), and endows the assembly of pouch cells with high energy density.

PHA synthase (PhaC) is the key enzyme in the polymerization of a biodegradable plastic&#8212;polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Structures of full&#8208;length PhaC reveal three key regions essential for substrate specificity and polymerization. Additionally, this study also highlights the critical role of N&#8208;domain&#8208;dependent dimerization in PhaC activity. These findings provide a foundation for enzyme engineering to enhance bioplastic production.








Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a biodegradable polyester that can serve as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, which present a serious source of pollution. PHA synthase (PhaC) is a key enzyme responsible for producing a wide variety of PHAs in microorganisms. Here, we present crystal structures of full&#8208;length PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, a high&#8208;performance PhaC employed for industrial use. The structure reveals an N&#8208;terminal helical domain that mediates head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization and stabilizes the C&#8208;terminal &#945;/&#946; catalytic domain to form a tunnel that connects the catalytic center embedded inside the protein to the protein surface. We showed that this tunnel is a putative egress tunnel for the product PHA chain. Our results establish a fundamental understanding of the PhaC machinery that should lead to improvement of this enzyme in industrial applications.

         <title>NO&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Nanovesicles with Co&#8208;Stimulatory Molecule Self&#8208;Presentation for Multidimensional Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasonic&#8208;empowered nanoDC that integrates NO&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer with artificial DC membrane is utilized to orchestrate a potent T cell immune response. The artificial membrane from genetically engineered CD86+ tumor cells directly activates infiltrating T cells, which are recruited by ultrasound&#8208;triggered protein S&#8208;nitrosylation and tumor ICD. The nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune activation in tumor sono&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Synergistically improving T cell responsiveness represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors; however, current treatments struggle to fully activate cancer&#8208;immunity cascade. We propose a novel gas&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanoplatform, triggering ultrasonic&#8208;sensitive tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and cascading immune activation. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the nanocore liberates reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, generating highly toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in situ. The ONOO&#8722; then orchestrated several intracellular events, including protein S&#8208;nitrosylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ICD&#8208;enhanced immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, the biomimetic artificial dendritic cell (DC) membranes, from genetically engineered tumor cells, simultaneously present peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHC&#8208;I) and CD86, enabling homologous tumor targeting but also mimicking the antigen presentation and costimulatory signaling of DCs to directly activate infiltrating T lymphocytes. In multiple murine models, this nanovaccine demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy, including tumor suppression, long&#8208;lasting antitumor immunity, and tumor metastasis inhibition. The ultrasound&#8208;responsive nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune boosters to address the challenges of immune tolerance and suboptimal patient response.

         <title>High Performance Capacitive Deionization Cathode of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Doped with Trace Molybdenum: Breaking the Capacity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

The high valence metal Mo&#8208;doped NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF electrode exhibits excellent desalination properties, including amazing adsorption capacity and remarkable cycling stability. Structural characterization and DFT studies show that NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF possesses multiple redox sites, low Na+ migration barriers, excellent reaction reversibility, and remarkable structural stability, resulting in an unprecedented improvement in desalination performance.








Abstract
Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is considered one of the most promising electrode materials for capacitive deionization (CDI) because of its excellent cycling stability and other advantages. However, the poor desalination ability and low adsorption capacity caused by a single reaction site seriously restrict its practical application. Here, a high&#8208;valence transition metal element Mo&#8208;doped strategy is proposed to utilize traces of Mo6+ to activate the inert&#8208;sites within NiHCF. The Mo&#8208;doped NiHCF electrodes (NiMox&#8208;HCF) with multiple pairs of redox active sites and long cycling capability were designed, breaking the trade&#8208;off between high adsorption capacity and cycling stability. The results show that the preferred NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF not only retains the excellent cycling stability (91% after 200 cycles), but also possesses a high adsorption capacity of 90.92&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 1.2&#160;V, which is much better than those of NiHCF under the same conditions. In addition, it has good practical application in simulated brackish water and circulating cooling water. Structural characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the Mo doping strategy enhanced electronic conductivity while maintaining structural stability. This research proposes a new method to activate inert sites using high&#8208;valence elements, thus effectively balancing the adsorption capacity and cycling stability of the electrode.

Structural characterization and DFT studies show that NiMo&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;-HCF possesses multiple redox sites, low Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration barriers, excellent reaction reversibility, and remarkable structural stability, resulting in an unprecedented improvement in desalination performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is considered one of the most promising electrode materials for capacitive deionization (CDI) because of its excellent cycling stability and other advantages. However, the poor desalination ability and low adsorption capacity caused by a single reaction site seriously restrict its practical application. Here, a high-valence transition metal element Mo-doped strategy is proposed to utilize traces of Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; to activate the inert-sites within NiHCF. The Mo-doped NiHCF electrodes (NiMo&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-HCF) with multiple pairs of redox active sites and long cycling capability were designed, breaking the trade-off between high adsorption capacity and cycling stability. The results show that the preferred NiMo&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;-HCF not only retains the excellent cycling stability (91% after 200 cycles), but also possesses a high adsorption capacity of 90.92&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.2&#160;V, which is much better than those of NiHCF under the same conditions. In addition, it has good practical application in simulated brackish water and circulating cooling water. Structural characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the Mo doping strategy enhanced electronic conductivity while maintaining structural stability. This research proposes a new method to activate inert sites using high-valence elements, thus effectively balancing the adsorption capacity and cycling stability of the electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Recognition of a DNA Four&#8208;Way Junction by an M2L4 Metallo&#8208;Cage, Inspired by a Simulation&#8208;Guided Design Approach</title>

         <dc:description>
DNA Holliday junctions, or four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) are an attractive therapeutic target due to their prevalence in DNA replication and repair, and viral disease. Combining experimental and computational methods, we show that quadruple&#8208;stranded dinuclear platinum metallo&#8208;cages are an excellent size and shape match for the cavity of the 4WJ open conformation, binding with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for junctions. 








Abstract
DNA four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) play an important biological role in DNA repair and recombination, and viral regulation, and are attractive therapeutic targets. Compounds that recognise the junction structure are rare; in this work, we describe cationic metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages as a new type of 4WJ binder with nanomolar affinities. A combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments show that the size and shape of a compound comprising square planar Pd or Pt and anthracene&#8208;based ligands is an excellent fit for the 4WJ cavity. Whilst the cage is also capable of binding to three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) and Y&#8208;fork structures, we show that the 4WJ is the preferred DNA target, and that duplex B&#8208;DNA is not a competitor. Among 3WJs, T&#8208;shape bulged 3WJs are bound more preferably than perfect Y&#8208;shaped 3WJs. Whilst previous work studying M2L4 metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages has focused on binding inside their structures, this work exploits the external aromatic surfaces of the supramolecule, creating a supramolecular guest that ideally matches the DNA host cavity. This approach allows available structures to be identified as potential junction binders and then screened for their fit to a nucleic acid junction target using simulations. This has potential to significantly accelerate discovery.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Ortho&#8208;Arylation Reaction of Benzoic Acids with Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic ortho&#8208;arylation method has been developed to convert arylthianthrenium salts into carboxylate&#8208;functionalized biaryls, which can be removed in situ or used for further derivatization. This reaction is broadly applicable to (hetero)arenecarboxylic acids, with excellent functional group compatibility and orthogonality to cross&#8208;couplings, enhancing the utility of thianthrenium salts in drug discovery.








Abstract
Arylthianthrenium salts have become key intermediates for late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug&#8208;like molecules. Ruthenium&#8208;phosphine catalysts are now shown to enable their use as aryl sources in high&#8208;yielding ortho&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of benzoic acids. The arylthianthrenium salts are converted chemo&#8208;selectively, leaving aryl halides and boronates untouched. The carboxylate groups are uniquely effective as directing groups, ensuring exclusive ortho&#8208;selectivity even in the presence of competing pyridine or amide groups. This makes the reaction orthogonal to cross&#8208;couplings and conventional C&#9472;H arylations. The carboxylate group can be removed via decarboxylation or serve as an anchor for downstream transformations. Mechanistic studies identify C&#9472;H ruthenation as the rate&#8208;limiting step and highlight the unique efficiency of P(Cy)&#8323; ligands.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Reforming Fuel Cell for Sustainable H2 Generation with &#8764;200% Faradaic Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC) achieves 200% FE and 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density via dual&#8208;electrode H2 generation, enabling CO2&#8208;free energy production. 








Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO), a promising yet challenging hydrogen carrier, offers a unique opportunity for efficient hydrogen generation through electro&#8208;oxidation, simultaneously eliminating harmful HCHO and contributing to environmental sustainability. This study rises to the challenge by pioneering a hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC), an integrated system that integrates anodic partial electro&#8208;reforming of aldehydes at low potential with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The device introduces a new self&#8208;powered paradigm for hydrogen generation, driven by electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE), featuring high Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production, co&#8208;generation of electricity, and HCOOH. The h&#8208;AAFHFC attains an open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.11&#160;V and a peak power density of 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, enabling simultaneous hydrogen production at both electrodes with an extraordinary Faradaic efficiency of approximately 200%. This breakthrough marks a transformative shift, moving from traditional electricity&#8208;driven systems to self&#8208;sustaining H2 generation. Our work demonstrates a promising pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, advancing the potential of clean hydrogen energy technologies.

Herein, a high polarity interface material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). CNCB exhibits the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation.

Abstract
Designing new interface materials with the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation is crucial for developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a high polarity interfacial material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the PSCs. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that CNCB interacts with perovskite precursors (PbI2 and FAI) to regulate crystallization kinetics, yielding perovskite films with preferred orientation and reduced defects. Simultaneously, CNCB chemically interacts with both SnO2 and perovskite surfaces, effectively passivating oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and undercoordinated Pb2&#8314; defects at the perovskite buried surface. Furthermore, the high dipole moment of CNCB induces beneficial interfacial polarization, optimizing energy level alignment and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability, retaining 87.14% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination. This work establishes a molecular design paradigm for multifunctional interfacial materials in perovskite optoelectronics, highlighting the synergistic roles of crystallization control, defect passivation, and dipole engineering in high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>Altering the Symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C by Axial Cl&#8208;Mediation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

This work reveals the &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy to alter the symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration via axial coordination of chlorine atoms to FePc molecules on CNTs matrix. The elongated Fe&#9472;N bonds and the transformation of Fe&#9472;N4 symmetry (from D4h to C4v) mitigate the dissolution of Fe centers, by which it allows to lower the ORR overpotential, optimize *OH desorption, and suppress harmful molecule adsorption, substantially improving ORR activity and the stability in zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is acknowledged as a promising alternative for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy conversion/storage applications. Herein, a &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy is proposed on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C for modulating the catalyst's electronic structure toward achieving remarkable ORR activity. By coordinating axial Cl atoms to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix, a Cl&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C (FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs) catalyst is synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs exhibit an improved ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V versus RHE in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the parent FePc&#8208;CNTs (0.88&#160;V versus RHE). The advanced nature of the as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs is evidenced by a configured high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery, which operates stably for over 150&#160;h. The experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil that axial Cl atoms induce the transformation of FePc from its original D4h to C4v symmetry, effectively altering the electrons distribution around the Fe&#8208;center, by which it optimizes *OH desorption and subsequently boosts the reaction kinetics. This work paves ways for resolving the dilemma of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts&#8217; exploration via engineering Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration.

         <title>Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I) Alkynyl Nanoclusters with Exposed Polyoxomolybdate Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

The catalytic active sites located on the periphery of the Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters significantly contributed to their exceptional photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction, demonstrating an impressive selectivity of nearly 100% toward CO.








Abstract
The directed synthesis of copper(I) nanoclusters with atomically precise active sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses notable challenges. By carefully regulating the acidity of the reaction system, a set of five atomically precise Mo&#8211;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters were effectively synthesized. The adjustment of the reaction system's acidity stimulates the polymerization of molybdate, consequently influencing the encapsulation structure of the outer copper(I) shell and thereby controlling the number of catalytically active sites located at the periphery of these nanoclusters. When subjected to xenon lamp irradiation, the synthesized Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters, which showcase exposed polyoxomolybdates, exhibit significantly activity in the conversion of CO2 to CO (up to 160.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) while maintaining an impressive selectivity of up to 99.9% without any additional sacrificial agent, cocatalyst or photosensitizer. When sacrificial agent and photosensitizer were added to the CO2RR system, the maximum CO production rates for Mo16Cu36&#8208;1 and Mo22Cu30 were 5672.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 7370.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, with CO selectivities of 90.3% and 90.6%. The Mo&#9472;O&#9472;Cu active sites play a dual role in enhancing both CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as facilitating charge separation. This study not only elucidates the synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity Mo&#8211;Cu nanoclusters with potent photocatalytic activity in CO2RR but also contributes to advancing our comprehension of the structure&#8208;property relationship inherent in nanocluster photocatalysts.

         <title>Metal Synergistic Dual Activation Enables Efficient Transesterification by Multinuclear Titanium Catalyst: Recycling and Upcycling of Polyester Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that facilitates the methanolysis of PET waste with record&#8208;high activity through a synergistic bi&#8208;titanium&#8208;facilitated dual activation mechanism. This catalyst also enables the re&#8208;polymerization of recovered monomers, promoting an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, it can be directly applied to upgrade PET waste into value&#8208;added engineering plastics, biodegradable polyesters, and thermoplastic elastomers.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient and selective catalysts for chemical recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is essential for establishing a sustainable plastics economy and reducing environmental impact. Here, we report a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that enables highly efficient transesterification reactions of esters and polyesters. Detailed experimental and computational studies have revealed that a bi&#8208;titanium framework facilitates a dual activation mechanism, activating both alcohol and ester simultaneously, thereby significantly enhancing the transesterification process. This catalyst demonstrated exceptionally high activity in the methanolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with an activity up to 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;gPET&#160;molTi&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 0.005&#160;mol% catalyst loading, producing polymerizable dimethyl ester and glycol monomers. Additionally, it effectively catalyzed the re&#8208;polymerization of the recovered monomers, yielding the original polyester with high molecular weight and thereby achieving an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, this catalyst can also be utilized for the efficient upgrading of PET waste via transesterification with 1,4&#8208;butanediol, polybutylene adipate, and poly(tetramethyene ether glycol), yielding engineering plastic, biodegradable polyester, and thermoplastic elastomer, respectively.

         <title>Fullerene Network&#8208;Buffered Platinum Nanoparticles Toward Efficient and Stable Electrochemical Ammonia Oxidation Reaction for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using covalently bonded two&#8208;dimensional fullerene (C60) polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) as unique support of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), we succeed in modulating the binding strengths of the key intermediates in the AOR process owing to the electron transfer between PNW&#8208;C60 and Pt NPs, which can enhance the recombination of NxHy species, avoiding the poisoning of adsorbed nitrogen&#8208;containing species. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Pt NPs/PNW&#8208;C60 exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 for the AOR as well as remarkable long&#8208;term durability, which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs.








Abstract
Green ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier due to its well&#8208;established production, storage, and transportation infrastructure. Moreover, hydrogen production via electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) requires a significantly lower theoretical potential than water electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor stability of AOR hinder the industrial application of ammonia electrolysis. Herein, we report the construction of two&#8208;dimensional covalently bonded fullerene polymeric network (PNW&#8208;C60) supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) as a highly active and stable AOR electrocatalyst. The unique electron buffering effect of PNW&#8208;C60 enhances the desorption of nitrogen&#8208;containing species and prevents their poisoning on the Pt NPs surface. Consequently, the as&#8208;obtained PNW&#8208;C60&#8208;buffered Pt NPs exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A gPt&#8722;1 as well as good stability, outperforming commercial Pt/C and graphene&#8208;supported Pt NPs AOR catalysts.

As a result, the as-prepared Pt NPs/PNW-C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the AOR as well as remarkable long-term durability, which is much superior to the commercial Pt/C and graphene-supported Pt NPs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier due to its well-established production, storage, and transportation infrastructure. Moreover, hydrogen production via electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) requires a significantly lower theoretical potential than water electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor stability of AOR hinder the industrial application of ammonia electrolysis. Herein, we report the construction of two-dimensional covalently bonded fullerene polymeric network (PNW-C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) as a highly active and stable AOR electrocatalyst. The unique electron buffering effect of PNW-C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; enhances the desorption of nitrogen-containing species and prevents their poisoning on the Pt NPs surface. Consequently, the as-obtained PNW-C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-buffered Pt NPs exhibits a high mass activity of 118&#160;A g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as good stability, outperforming commercial Pt/C and graphene-supported Pt NPs AOR catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Multi&#8208;Interface Chemistry by Functional Carbon Dots for High&#8208;Performance Composite Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of synergistic multi&#8208;interfacial regulation is proposed to construct high&#8208;performance composite solid electrolytes, and N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots play the key role in regulating multi&#8208;interfacial structures, including the conversion of surface residual alkali of LLZTO into ionic conductor interlayer and the formation of bridging interlayer between PEO and LLZTO.








Abstract
Low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical strength, and unstable interface structure are still the main factors hindering the practical application of polymer solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). In this work, we have developed a unique composite filler (LLZTOCDs) for solid polymer electrolytes to address these challenges through synergistic regulation of multi&#8208;interface chemistry. The LLZTOCDs is prepared via thermal treatment of N,S,F&#8208;codoped carbon dots (NSFCDs) and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) inorganic electrolyte. Here, the detrimental Li2CO3 on the LLZTO surface is converted into a fast ion&#8208;conducting and an electron&#8208;insulating interlayer of LiF and Li3N, and the carbon dots self&#8208;assemble into a functional organophilic coating on the outermost layer, which acts as a bridge between the LLZTO and the polymer. This unique structure enhances the compatibility and ion&#8208;exchange kinetics between the LLZTOCDs and the polymer, significantly improving the mechanical strength and Li+ transport. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed in situ at the LLZTOCDs interface provide an anion confinement effect, increasing lithium salt dissociation, and enhancing the Li+ transference number to 0.85. Therefore, the solid battery constructed with LLZTOCDs exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, long&#8208;cycle life, and high ionic conductivity (1.96&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), providing a feasible strategy for practical applications.

         <title>Circular RNA&#8208;Based Molecular Computation Enhances Plasma Biomarker Detection in Biliary Tract Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system integrating plasma circular RNA (circRNA) biomarkers for diagnosing biliary tract cancer (BTC). By identifying four differentially expressed circRNAs, we designed a logistic regression model (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.970) translated into a DNA computation framework, demonstrating cost&#8208;effective, rapid diagnostics without complex instrumentation.








Abstract
Molecular diagnosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Although large panels based on multi&#8208;biomarkers have demonstrated potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, their clinical application is hindered by complexity and high costs. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system that integrates the detection of plasma circular RNAs (circRNAs) with molecular computation, enabling intelligent and rapid diagnosis of BTC. By identifying and validating a specific and small set of circRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in BTC patients, we designed a DNA computation framework that directly translates biomarker levels into diagnostic outcomes without the need of external analysis and interpretation. In a validation cohort of 70 individuals, our approach achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its potential as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient tool for rapid diagnosis of BTC. This work highlights the potential of molecular computation in enhancing integrated and rapid cancer diagnostics, paving the way for clinical implementation.

         <title>Accelerated Design of Fenton&#8208;Like Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Adaptive Learning with Genetic Programming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an advanced adaptive learning genetic algorithm (ALGA) to optimize Fenton&#8208;like Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) synthesis, markedly reducing experimental iterations. Unlike traditional methods, ALGA integrates genetic principles with active learning, identifying high&#8208;performance Fenton&#8208;like SACs with minimal experimentation. Results demonstrate a threefold efficiency gain in phenol degradation with our optimized SACs, showcasing ALGA's potential in accelerating the design of SACs.








Abstract
Traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for optimizing catalyst synthesis are time&#8208;consuming and costly, exploring only a small fraction of the vast combinatorial space. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative but still has the limitation of relying on well&#8208;selected initial datasets, which the recent development of active learning (AL) could be addressed. Here, we novelly integrate an AL&#8208;derived algorithm, the adaptive learning genetic algorithm (ALGA), into experimental workflows to optimize the synthesis of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Our results show that the closed&#8208;loop ALGA framework effectively learns from limited and sparse datasets, greatly reducing the research cycle compared to traditional ML and AL frameworks. By iteratively retaining better&#8208;performing genetic information and proactively expanding the search space through mutation and crossover, ALGA identifies the highest&#8208;performing Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs with less than 90 experiments. The maximum phenol degradation rate k&#8208;value (0.147&#160;min&#8722;1) achieved within the ALGA framework is approximately three times higher than that of the initial dataset and surpasses the reported best Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs. Our successful implementation of ALGA signifies an advancement in SACs synthesis assisted by the AL&#8208;derived algorithm, offering a guiding methodology for the exploration of other functional materials.

         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition with tunable transition time and hydrogel stiffness have been realized by coupling the Hofmeister effect&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly with a simple enzymatic reaction. This new finding not only furthers the understanding of specific ion effect in control of biological functions but also offers a new opportunity for the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating soft materials.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular interactions is essential for the creation of dynamic supramolecular materials with lifelike self&#8208;regulating functions. Yet specific ion effect, which is known to possess potent effect on intermolecular interactions, has remained unexplored for such a purpose. Here, we demonstrate our access to dynamic self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular hydrogels by orchestrating the Hofmeister effect through a simple enzymatic reaction. The involved gelators containing carboxylate moieties self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel1) at acidic pH and dissolve at basic pH. We surprisingly find that the dissolved gelators at basic pH can be driven to self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel2) by kosmotropic ions through the disruption of gelator&#8211;water interactions. By coupling to the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, Gel1 gradually disintegrates over time because of the production of basic NH3. However, interestingly, with the accumulation of kosmotropic ions, NH4+ and CO32&#8722;, the dissolved gelators are driven to self&#8208;assemble into Gel2, realizing a self&#8208;regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition process. The transition rate and stiffness of Gel2 are tunable by adjusting the concentrations of urea or urease. This work may shed light on the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating supramolecular materials using Hofmeister effect for many enticing applications such as ion&#8208;programmed biosensing and drug delivery.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the dissolved gelators are driven to self-assemble into Gel2, realizing a self-regulating gel&#8211;sol&#8211;gel transition process. The transition rate and stiffness of Gel2 are tunable by adjusting the concentrations of urea or urease. This work may shed light on the creation of lifelike self-regulating supramolecular materials using Hofmeister effect for many enticing applications such as ion-programmed biosensing and drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bismuth Meets Olefins: Ethylene Activation and Reversible Alkene Insertion into Bi&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth compounds have been exposed to simple &#945;&#8208;olefins, including the benchmark substrate ethylene. Unprecedented and facile insertion, extrusion, and olefin exchange scenarios have been realized. The scope, mechanism, and functional group tolerance of these peerless transformations have been investigated in a combined experimental and theoretical approach.








Abstract
Owing to its fundamental properties as the parent olefin, its outstanding industrial relevance, and the challenges associated with its activation, ethylene remains a benchmark substrate, especially in main group chemistry. Here we report the unprecedented activation of ethylene and related simple &#945;&#8208;olefins by well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth complexes. The polarization of a substrate by a softly Lewis&#8208;acidic central atom and a nucleophilic functional group positioned in a constrained geometry is for the first time exploited in the activation of ethylene and related olefins by compounds of a heavy p&#8208;block element. Mechanistic investigations point toward a coordination&#8208;insertion&#8208;reaction mechanism. The bonding properties of the cationic bismuth species facilitate unprecedented reversible reactivity patterns and unusual characteristics in chemoselectivity.

         <title>Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Pure Nitrate Reduction via Tuning Bimetallic Sites in Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction was enhanced by modulating the adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption of species in the CoN4&#8211;NiS4 system. a The [CoN4] site selectively adsorbs and reduces nitrate, while the [NiS4] site mimics ferredoxin to accelerate nitrite conversion. Dynamic *H equilibrium suppresses the HER and enhances ammonia selectivity. The thiophene unit facilitates electron transfer and optimizes reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) represents a promising approach for ammonia synthesis, but existing application has been constrained by the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and the sluggish kinetics induced by various intermediates. Herein, we synthesized a series of metalized covalent organic frameworks: NiTP&#8208;MTAPP MCOFs (M&#160;=&#160;2H, Co, Cu, and Fe), based on dual redox&#8208;active centers: thiophene&#8208;substituted Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) ligand&#8208;Ni[C2S2(C4H2SCHO)2]2 and metallic porphyrin. Through regulating the adsorption and desorption of species at the catalytic sites, we have identified the optimal NITRR electrocatalyst: NiTP&#8208;CoTAPP MCOF, which achieved the highest faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 85.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V (vs. RHE) in pure nitrate solution, with an impressive yield rate of 160.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. The generation of active hydrogen at [NiS4] sites achieved dynamic equilibrium with the timely hydrogenation reaction at CoN4 sites, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the incorporation of thiophene (TP) groups and metal ions facilitates charge transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the reduction in energy barriers at different catalytic sites. The CoN4&#8722;NiS4 system exhibited the optimal adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption capability and the lowest energy barrier (0.58&#160;eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO&#160;&#8594;&#160;*HNO), which is supported by the moderate d&#8208;band center and Bader charge value.

         <title>Constructions of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles Through Phosphine&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Controlled Switch of Selectivity Between Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discloses phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled switch of the chemoselectivity between Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular and intermolecular cyclizations. Easily dissociating P(tBu)3 ligand promotes intramolecular macrocyclization due to favorable interaction of Pd&#8208;catalyst with coordinating groups of substrates to construct strained and strain&#8208;free 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles, and PPh3 ligand affords strained&#8208;free macrocycles via intermolecular coupling pathway.








Abstract
The rigid biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles serve as core scaffolds in numerous bioactive molecules. However, constructing biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles smaller than 14&#8208;membered ring remains challenging, partially due to the strain present in the cyclic intermediates formed during their synthesis. Here, we report that a Pd catalyst supported by P(tBu)3 effectively promotes the intramolecular ortho C&#9472;H arylation of phenols with aryl bromides, leading to the efficient synthesis of both strained 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles and strain&#8208;free bimolecular counterparts. The success of this Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization in generating strained macrocycles originates from the dissociation of the P(tBu)3 ligand from the Pd center, which facilitates dual chelation of functional groups of substrates to the Pd center of palladacycle intermediate for alleviating its strain. Additionally, Pd catalysts supported by PPh3 promote intermolecular cyclization of the same substrates, enabling formation of larger macrocycles bridged by two 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl motifs. These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemoselectivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.

         <title>Unveiling an In Situ H2O2 Production: Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;H2O2 Battery Powering 26 LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed an aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery, which targets two birds&#8208;one stone approach via generating H2O2 while discharging and O2 while charging. In situ electrochemical Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopic measurements exhibited the formation of real&#8208;time analysis of products. Local pH insights were examined via micro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Moreover, Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries powered 26 LEDs for more than 7 days.








Abstract
Looking toward ever&#8208;growing energy demand, the advancement in energy storage devices and carrying out electrocatalytic reactions in an efficient way is the need of the hour. Herein, we have employed the two birds&#8208;one stone approach, viz. fusing energy conversion and storing system enabling 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to value&#8208;added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) product and its utilization in the energy storage devices using MnWO4 catalyst, without any external H2O2 source. The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H2O2 production of 98% @ 0.37 V versus RHE. The real&#8208;time H2O2 production was monitored by in&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The pivotal influence of electrolyte composition, viz. local pH and the formation of carbonate species on H&#8322;O&#8322; production was meticulously examined through micro&#8208;electrochemical studies using gold (Au) microelectrodes. Further, we have explored an aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery utilizing MnWO4 as bifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable H2O2 production simultaneously producing the electricity. The Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery exhibited a remarkable cycle life of 136&#160;h and an practical energy efficiency of 43%. The galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge measurement of Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery attained a capacity of 25&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The battery also demonstrated &#8805;90% cycle efficiency. Interestingly, the designed Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery (two connected in series) exhibited a stable open circuit voltage (OCV) with a promising power density of 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries by powering 26 blue LEDs for more than 180&#160;h (7 days) without fading in the illumination of LEDs.

The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production of 98% @ 0.37 V versus RHE. The real-time H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production was monitored by in-situ electrochemical Raman and in-situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The pivotal influence of electrolyte composition, viz. local pH and the formation of carbonate species on H&#8322;O&#8322; production was meticulously examined through micro-electrochemical studies using gold (Au) microelectrodes. Further, we have explored an aqueous rechargeable Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery utilizing MnWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as bifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production simultaneously producing the electricity. The Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery exhibited a remarkable cycle life of 136&#160;h and an practical energy efficiency of 43%. The galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge measurement of Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery attained a capacity of 25&#160;mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 3&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The battery also demonstrated &#8805;90% cycle efficiency. Interestingly, the designed Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery (two connected in series) exhibited a stable open circuit voltage (OCV) with a promising power density of 10.5&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries by powering 26 blue LEDs for more than 180&#160;h (7 days) without fading in the illumination of LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Alkenylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine and Naphthalene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic dual chiral primary amine and naphthalene catalysis was identified through enamine&#8208;redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) to enable effective electrochemical singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO)&#8208;type coupling with alkenyl trifluoroborate. Mechanistic studies reveal ion&#8208;pair interactions between the protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate, leading to exceptional enantioselectivity.








Abstract
External tuning of enamine intermediate has significantly expanded reaction space of typical aminocatalysis. Notwithstanding the progress of chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;oxidation of enamine intermediate, electro&#8208;oxidation was left as a much less explored area, in stark contrast to the prosperous renaissance of electrochemistry in recent years. Challenges mainly come from the reactivity barrier as a consequence of heterogeneous electron transfer and subtle stereocontrol in ionic electrolyte solution under the influence of electric field. Herein, we report asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of carbonyl compounds using potassium alkenyl trifluoroborate as a model reaction to demonstrate the capability of primary amine catalysis under electrochemical conditions. By employing enamine redox mediator mapping (e&#8208;RM2) strategy, a new organic mediator, dimethoxyl naphthalene, was found to greatly enhance reactivity. Mechanistic studies uncover an ion&#8208;pair interaction between protonated aminocatalyst and anionic substrate that accounts for the exceptional enantioselectivity. This catalytic system demonstrates the best level of enantioselectivities in electro&#8208;oxidative enamine transformations so far.

         <title>Isomerisation and Insertion Chemistry of Imidosilanes Enabled by Reversible Si(IV)/Si(II) Redox Shuttling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rearrangement and functionalisation chemistry at silicon facilitated by reductive ligand migration and Si(II)/Si(IV) redox shuttling.








Abstract
Spontaneous redox shuttling at silicon is very rare, primarily reflecting the thermodynamic challenges associated with reduction processes for lighter p&#8208;block elements. Here we show that the reactions of boryl&#8208;substituted silylene {PhC(tBuN)2}Si{B(NDippCH)2} with an organo&#8208;azide proceed through a Si(IV)&#8208;Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV) series of redox processes involving both oxidative and reductive ligand migration steps. Each of the isomeric compounds related through this reaction manifold is isolable (and can be structurally characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography), with the overall free energy profile being close to thermo&#8208;neutral. Broader studies within group 14 imply that this redox shuttling is unique to silicon and that reductive ligand migration also plays a role in O&#8208;atom insertion chemistry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyanation of Propargylic Radicals Derived From Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched propargyl nitriles via copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyanation of propargylic radicals, which are generated from silyl&#8208;substituted allenes or alkynes. These reactions proceeded through a highly site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) with Cu(II)&#8208;bound nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs). Notably, silyl&#8208;substituted allenes demonstrate exceptional allenic sp2 C&#9472;H bond activation selectivity, outcompeting alternative reactive sp3 C&#9472;H bonds in HAA processes.

         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;ethynylation of oxindoles is realized by virtue of spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA)&#8208;triazolium organocation catalysis. Taking advantage of this methodology and development of 1,6&#8208;aza&#8208;Michael additions with and without an aminolysis process, the collective total synthesis of two types of indole alkaloids was also accomplished.








Abstract
The all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center of oxindoles is a crucial structural element of a broad spectrum of indole alkaloids, imparting these molecules with rigid three&#8208;dimensional configurations essential for their biological activities. Here, we present a catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;ethynylation reaction of oxindoles taking advantage of the catalysis of a spiropyrrolidine amide (SPA) triazolium. This transformation enables the enantioselective construction of the C3 quaternary carbon stereocenter of oxindoles while introducing a versatile ethynyl functionality. Employment of this methodology has been demonstrated in the divergent total synthesis of indole alkaloids (&#8208;)&#8208;corynoxine, (&#8208;)&#8208;isorhynchophylline, (&#8208;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;limaspermidine, featuring a protecting group&#8208;dependent 1,6&#8208;Michael addition or an aminolysis/1,6&#8208;Michael addition sequence to generate two distinct types of spiro&#8208;indoles, tailored for different late&#8208;stage synthetic purposes.

         <title>Desulfurizative Fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 Thioformamides for the Efficient Synthesis of N(CF3)(CF2H) Amines with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines, which display a 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability over N&#8208;CF3 amines. The compounds are synthesized through a desulfurization&#8211;fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides. 








Abstract
With poor metabolic stability being a major cause of failure in drug development, there is a pressing need for strategic molecular modifications to optimize for desired properties and function. N&#8208;substitution has emerged as a powerful approach, with N&#8208;CF3 amines previously demonstrating enhanced lipophilicity and reduced susceptibility to oxidation, albeit inherent instability to hydrolysis. This report discloses the further evolution of this motif&#8212;the introduction of an additional N&#8208;difluoromethyl unit, resulting in an extraordinary 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability. We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines. The method relies on an operationally simple desulfurization&#8211;fluorination strategy of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides and is characterized by broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Reductive Arylation and Alkenylation of Sulfinylamines to Access Sulfinamides Enabled by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines was developed, yielding enantiopure aryl and alkenyl sulfinamides with high efficiency. Mechanistic insights indicate that migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group is crucial for enantioselectivity.








Abstract
This study reports a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines, facilitating the efficient synthesis of enantiopure sulfinamides. By employing a cobalt/chiral diphosphine and tridentate ligand system, a range of diverse aryl and alkenyl iodides were successfully transformed into sulfinamides, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. This methodology underscores the utility of sulfinylamines as versatile electrophilic sulfur sources. Detailed mechanistic insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the key step involves migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group, which plays a crucial role in enantioselectivity. These findings offer a sustainable approach for the development of biologically relative enantiopure sulfur&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Day&#8208;Long Organic Persistent Luminescence in Flexible Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A day&#8208;long organic afterglow (28&#160;+&#160;h) is achieved via electron donor/acceptor exciplexes, where polyethylene naphthalate serves dual roles as acceptor/charge&#8208;storage unit and spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole acts as donor, enabling efficient UV/sunlight&#8208;triggered charge separation.








Abstract
The progress in organic afterglow materials has drawn significant attention due to their extensive applications in fields such as optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bioimaging. Nonetheless, a general limitation of organic afterglow materials is their short emission lifetimes, typically spanning from milliseconds to seconds, which creates a substantial challenge in developing day&#8208;long organic afterglow (DOA). In this study, a DOA system is demonstrated through the incorporation of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Polyethylene naphthalate is used for both the electron acceptor and charge storage units, coupling with a spirobifluorene&#8208;carbazole derivative as the electron donor, providing effective charge separations under UV&#8208;light and sunlight excitation. The resulting DOA polymers demonstrate an exceptional bluish&#8208;green afterglow that endures for over 28&#160;h under ambient conditions, setting a new record for the longest afterglow duration in polymeric materials. Moreover, the DOA&#8208;doped polymers, as both films and fibers, exhibit outstanding flexibility and transparency, making them highly suitable for flexible technologies and wearable devices.

         <title>Stable Mg2+ Dication Weakly Stabilized/Coordinated in Solution: Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity, and Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating carborates was first prepared and structurally characterized as a soluble salt in organic solvents. Combined experimental and theoretical data provided valuable insights into its behavior/reactivity in solution. All data agree with a strong Lewis acidic Mg2+ center, readily coordinating alkenes and alkynes and effectively catalyzing alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation and imine hydrogenation.








Abstract
The first soluble and stable Mg2+ dication stabilized only by weakly coordinating and chemically robust carborate anions [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; is described. Mg[HexCB11Cl11]2 (1), prepared by reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with 2 equiv of [Ph3C][HexCB11Cl11], consists, in the solid state, of a central Mg2+ surrounded by two [HexCB11Cl11]&#8722; anions. In solution, experimental and classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained, reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center. Yet, reflecting only weak anion/cation interactions, species 1 polymerizes 1&#8208;hexene and coordinates alkynes. However, 1 displays no reaction with HSiEt3 at room temperature, consistent with a low hydridicity of the hard (HSAB) Mg2+ center. Contrasting with 1 (FIA&#160;=&#160;264&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1; FIA: Fluoride Ion Affinity), salt Mg[(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]2 (2), incorporating the more basic ammoniododecaborate [(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]&#8722; anion, is significantly less Lewis acidic (FIA&#160;=&#160;214.7&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and unreactive with alkenes and alkynes. Salt 1 effectively catalyzes alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation via an initial alkene/alkyne coordination/initiation, as suggested by experimental and computational data. It also efficiently catalyzes (with a catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol%) the hydrosilylation of CO2 to CH4 in the presence of HSiEt3. Salt 1 smoothly promotes the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, and it is also an active imine hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of H2.

The amorphous TaOx layer passivates surface defects and resists corrosion, enabling durable solar&#8208;driven water splitting. This scalable strategy addresses interfacial degradation, advancing PEC technologies for clean fuel production.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells offer significant advantages for solar&#8208;to&#8208;clean fuel conversion but face challenges such as surface recombination and poor stability, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of device failure mechanisms and effective mitigation strategies. Using nickel&#8208;decorated n&#8208;type silicon (n&#8208;Si/Ni) as a model photoelectrode, we demonstrate that surface restructuring during operation initially passivates surface recombination but eventually blocks photogenerated hole transfer, leading to device failure. To mitigate this challenge, an ultrathin (&lt;1&#160;nm) tantalum oxide (TaOx) interlayer is introduced via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This TaOx layer serves as both a passivating contact and a corrosion&#8208;resistant coating. The n&#8208;Si/TaOx/Ni electrode achieves an increased photovoltage from 150 to 500&#160;mV during the activation process,&#160;and then significantly extends the device lifespan, maintaining over 90% performance for 500&#160;h in 1&#160;M KOH at 1.52&#160;V versus RHE. These results highlight the implementation of amorphous TaOx in enhancing both the efficiency and durability of silicon&#8208;based PEC systems, providing a simultaneously passivating and protective strategy for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies under harsh conditions.

         <title>Fused Dual&#8208;Donor Design for Accelerating Reverse Intersystem Crossing Rates of Spatially Folded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A type TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2) with dual&#8208;donor fusion design have been developed, which achieve the accelerated RISC rates (up to 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1) through dense excited&#8208;state engineering, enabling solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high EQEs (23.9%) and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
The development of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT)&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is defective in relatively low reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates (commonly &lt;5&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1). Herein, we fuse two 3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IAc) donor units to obtain large planar donors (m&#8208;bIAc and p&#8208;bIAc) for forming spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A configured TSCT emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2). The configuration of highly parallel and large&#8208;plane intramolecular multiple &#960;&#8208;stacking has been achieved. The symmetrical multi&#8208;channel charge transfer networks of emitters induce multiple energetically proximal excited states within a small energy range (&lt;0.12&#160;eV) at the lowest excited state, creating additional configuration interaction and spin&#8208;orbit coupling channels to accelerate the RISC process. This molecular configuration yields enhanced RISC rates of 6.19&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;1 and 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;2. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 18.9% (DCT&#8208;1, 474&#160;nm sky&#8208;blue emission) and 23.9% (DCT&#8208;2, 498&#160;nm green emission), with attenuated efficiency roll&#8208;offs of DCT&#8208;2 (12% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2). This work provides a critical pathway for manipulating dense excited states to address the bottleneck of the RISC rates while maintaining structural rigidity, promoting further advancement of TSCT&#8208;TADF materials.

         <title>The Mechanism of Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#9472;H Arylation of Arenes: The Key Role of Bis&#8208;Cyclometalated Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#9472;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes is addressed through experimental stoichiometric, catalytic kinetic, and DFT studies. These reveal a key role for bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species and show bromoarene activation proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition. Bromoarene activation at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species is ruled out.








Abstract
The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#8208;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes has been under intense scrutiny over the last decade, with conflicting proposals concerning the relevance of various catalytic intermediates and the nature of the key steps. This work presents experimental and computational studies that address these long&#8208;standing questions. Stoichiometric, catalytic, and mechanistic kinetic studies, supported by DFT calculations, reveal that bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species are key intermediates in these reactions. These studies also show that oxidative addition with bromoarenes proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition pathway, as demonstrated by DFT and experimental kinetic orders. Bromoarene activation does not proceed at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species. In the catalytic process, zero order kinetics are observed on both reaction substrates, an observation that is rationalized by DFT calculations which predict a rate&#8208;limiting step within the product&#8208;release stage. These results showcase how detailed experimental and DFT studies can combine to probe mechanistic questions, as well as resolving opposing views around the mechanism of these Ru&#8208;catalyzed arylations that form the basis of promising mild C&#9472;H functionalizations.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Interconversion of Pyridine Dicarbanion&#8208;Bonded Ag13 Nanocluster Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the interplay between solvent environments and structural evolution of in situ formed polynuclear organometallic cluster intermediates. The solvent&#8208;mediated interconversion between two structural isomers reveals distinct stability and reactivity profiles, which stem from solvent&#8208;regulated variations in metal&#8211;metal bonding interactions and adaptive ligand configurations.








Abstract
Solvent screening is pivotal for optimizing metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, yet its impact on the in situ formation and reactivity of polynuclear organometallic clusters remains underexplored. We herein isolate two distinct thirteen&#8208;membered silver cluster isomers, Ag13&#8208;A and Ag13&#8208;M, in acetone and methanol, respectively. Significantly, we demonstrate the interconversion of these isomers facilitated by solvent manipulation. Mechanistic studies on the solvent&#8208;driven Ag13&#8208;A to Ag13&#8208;M transformation reveal this transformation proceeds with a low activation energy (23.39 &#177; 0.81 kcal mol&#8722;1) and positive entropy, involving counter anion dissociation, ligand twisting, and re&#8208;coordination. The observed differences in thermal stability and reactivity between two isomers are attributed to variations in Ag&#8211;Ag interactions and surface ligand arrangements, underscoring the critical role of solvent selection in affecting the whole organic transformation through in situ formed clusters. These results highlight the necessity of considering organometallic cluster intermediates in solvent screening.

         <dc:description>
A &#160;dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst has been synthesized according to ligand micro&#8208;environmental regulation, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of alkynes and vinyl boron reagents. Computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode for 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination process, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing key intermediates, and provide new opportunities for cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
Cooperative catalysis enabled by dinuclear metal complexes can integrate the catalytic properties of each metal center, thus opening new avenues to achieve challenging reaction selectivity that are difficult to accomplish with mononuclear metal catalysts. Here, we present a cooperative catalysis strategy using a newly synthesized dinuclear PNP&#8208;Au2 catalyst, which positions two gold centers in close proximity, facilitating favorable geometric and electronic interactions for the synergistic activation of both coupling partners (alkynes and vinyl boron reagents) in the oxidative C&#9472;C coupling. It demonstrates a broad substrate tolerance for both terminal and internal alkynes, providing a versatile platform for the synthesis of enynes and dienes. Mechanistic and computational studies reveal a unique 1,2&#8208;cooperative activation mode, significantly reducing the free energy barrier and stabilizing the key intermediates, thus promoting C&#9472;C bond formation in an efficient manner. The DFT calculations indicate a less explored 1,2&#8208;reductive elimination elementary step. Interestingly, the use of B(OiPr)3 as an additive can effectively prevent the decomposition of dinuclear gold catalyst under oxidative fluoride&#8208;containing conditions.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Networks Mediated by Redox&#8208;Responsive Neighboring&#8208;Group&#8208;Participating Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

The strong neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) effect of selenium&#8208;bridged bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane bis&#8208;alkyl halide (Se&#8208;BCN) demonstrates great potential as a crosslinker for the synthesis of covalent adaptable networks. The activity of selenium&#8208;based NGP can be regulated by oxidation and reduction of the selenium atom, thus allowing the dynamic performance of such crosslinked networks to be controlled through redox response.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) typically require external catalysts to facilitate efficient crosslinker exchange, which can limit the reprocessability of the network due to leaching and degradation of the catalyst. In this study, the use of catalysts was avoided by employing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (BCN) bis&#8208;alkyl halide crosslinker with selenium&#8208;based neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) to enhance the rate of bond exchange. This thermally mediated C&#9472;N alkyl exchange and the associated flow behavior enabled the intrinsically ionic network (which possesses antimicrobial properties) to be both chemically recycled and repaired and reprocessed under mild conditions. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of the network can be regulated by the reversible redox responsiveness of selenium atoms within the network. This novel type of NGP&#8208;based CAN therefore has the potential to enrich designs for catalyst&#8208;free dynamic networks with high performance and modulated dynamicity.

         <title>Coronal Complexation Induces Snowman&#8208;Shaped Janus Polymersome Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snowman&#8208;like Janus polymersomes were produced in a simple, yet versatile two&#8208;step approach involving a plasticizing agent and a cationic polymer additive to complex with the charged polymersome. Shape transformation was driven by coronal complexation altering membrane structure, followed by segregation of the polymer additive to form a protruding bleb of the Janus polymersome.








Abstract
Engineering polymersome shape is a keen area of interest because minimal variations in polymersome properties can greatly affect the performance of nanoreactors, drug delivery vehicles, and more. Although methods to transform polymersome shapes have been evolving rapidly, limitations remain in the scope of applicable polymersome compositions and adaptability to engineer a desired shape. In this work, we developed a method utilizing cationic polymer additives and coronal complexation to transform charged spherical polymersomes into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. The resulting morphologies feature a hollow polymersome compartment conjoined to a protruding bleb consisting of the complexed polymer additive, which we propose forms via a dewetting process. This methodology provides enhanced shape control through adjustments in additive composition or plasticizer content, offering additional routes to engineering novel polymersome structures.

         <title>Decoding Double Layer Dynamics for CO2${\rm CO}_2$ Electroreduction over Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different regions of the electrode/electrolyte interface, such as the interfacial layer and diffuse double layer, are spectroscopically discerned by analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectra. In this way, discrete events relating to reorientation of water molecules in the double layer are elucidated, which correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO.








Abstract
Understanding the nature and role of the electric double layer (EDL) at electrocatalytic interfaces and its dynamic evolution, is critical to optimizing electrochemical processes such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$). Despite its postulated significant influence on CO2RR${\rm CO}_2{\rm RR}$ activity, direct spectroscopic evidence of the complex interplay between EDL structure and reaction kinetics has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Dynamic Response Spectroscopy (DRS), a novel approach that isolates spectroscopic signatures of key physicochemical features of the EDL, including the compact (interfacial) layer and the diffuse double layer based on their time&#8208;variance profiles. By analyzing multi&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. We provide spectroscopic evidence that these sudden EDL reorganizations correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2${\rm CO}_2$ to CO. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2${\rm CO}_2$, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice&#8208;like ordering and increased randomness. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of the EDL and its synergistic role in electrocatalysis, establishing a paradigm to better understand, and thus optimize, electrochemical&#160;systems.

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism for Unconventional Anodic Reaction of Aldehyde Oxidation for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of nonelectrochemical steps and electrochemical steps enables the unconventional anodic reaction of aldehyde oxidation for hydrogen production (AOR&#8208;H2), which is expected to break through the limit of existing energy conversion systems. Additionally,&#160;decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2 because the Pt species favor the electrochemical O&#9472;H bond cleavage.








Abstract
Anodic reactions involving non&#8208;faradaic processes have significantly expanded the potential application of anodic oxidation half&#8208;reactions. Metallic Cu materials can catalyze an unconventional anodic aldehyde oxidation reaction involving the non&#8208;faradaic H2 production (AOR&#8208;H2). AOR&#8208;H2 has distinct advantages of ultra&#8208;low thermodynamic potentials and high value&#8208;added redox products, etc., but the question of exactly how reduction steps occur during AOR&#8208;H2, is something which has long puzzled scientists. Here we illustrate the novel synergistic mechanism of nonelectrochemical/electrochemical redox steps in AOR&#8208;H2. Aldehyde undergoes hydration, deprotonation, and spontaneous C&#8211;H homolytic cleavage to generate H2, and then is electrochemically oxidized to form carboxylate. Decorating Cu catalysts with metallic Pt species, supported by theoretical calculations, leads to a 12&#8208;fold increase in the intrinsic activity of AOR&#8208;H2. This work inspires researchers to develop novel cathodic and anodic reactions involving the non&#8208;faradaic process for breaking through the limit of existing energy conversion systems.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of WC Powder Electrocatalysts Probed In Situ with NAP&#8208;XPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>

Tungsten carbide (WC) is a highly active catalyst for the HER. The reasons for its activity are, however, unclear due to its delicate susceptibility to oxidation and thus passivation. Electrochemical near ambient pressure XPS reveals dissolution of the passive film into the electrolyte under electrochemical working conditions, which effectively enables the electrocatalyst's enduring activity.








Abstract
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a renowned compound catalyst material for electrochemical water splitting, and its high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been repeatedly reported. However, its susceptibility to oxidation raises the fundamental question of the underlying reason for its high activity, especially since passivation and thus potential deactivation can occur not only in air but also during reaction. Hence, the investigation of the surface chemistry under true operating conditions is crucial for a fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic process. In this work, we use electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EC&#8208;XPS) to revisit the surface chemistry of WC powder electrodes in alkaline electrolyte in situ and under full potential control. Our results show that although the surface is initially covered with oxide, this passive film dissolves in the electrolyte under electrochemical reaction conditions. This clarifies the active surface termination during the HER and highlights the potential of laboratory&#8208;based EC&#8208;XPS to study applied energy conversion materials.

         <title>Integrating Multifunctionalities into a 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich supramolecular cages and porphyrin moieties as well as single&#8208;atomic metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) together, two metalated photoactive covalent organic frameworks are constructed for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is still challenging. Herein, integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich organic cages and the photoactive porphyrin moieties together, a 3D covalent organic framework (COF), Cage&#8208;PorCOF, is successfully synthesized. After incorporating metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) into the cage&#8208;based COF, Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) are subsequently constructed for the CO2 photoreduction. Catalytic experiments show impressive performance in CO2 photoreduction with CO generation rates of up to 48&#160;748 and 28&#160;446&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the first initiating hour for Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni), respectively, which is attributed to the synergistic effects from CO2&#8208;affinity of the porous frameworks and incorporated metal atoms, the light&#8208;absorption and charge separation ability of metalloporphyrin groups as well as the fully exposed single&#8208;atomic catalytic sites confirmed by both experimental and theoretical analyses. This study demonstrates that by the integration of multiple functionalities into 3D porous solids, highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 conversion can be achieved.

         <title>To Make a Painstaking Investigation: Revealing the Electrochemical Reactions in Aqueous Zn&#9472;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition mechanism is not clear. To verify the underlying mechanism, skillfully managing compositional Zn||MnO2 battery, revealing the dual&#8208;discharge platform chemistry due to dissolution reaction rather than Zn2+/H+ intercalation. They influenced by proton concentration and Zn2+ hydrolysis, with Discharge Plateau I driven by excess H+ and Plateau II by Zn2+ hydrolysis.








Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries have been extensively explored, but the electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in terms of Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, are still not fully understood. Herein, a Zn||MnO2&#8208;based battery system is constructed and the variation of the battery composition is skillfully regulated by the separation of variables. The possibility of Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry is ruled out and the dominance of the dissolution/deposition mechanism is strongly demonstrated. This study confirms that the chemistry of the controversial double&#8208;discharge platform is a dissolution reaction, determined by different proton concentrations and zinc ions hydrolysis. Discharge Plateau I is the MnO2 dissolution dominated by the surplus H+ in the electrolyte, while Discharge Plateau II is the smooth discharge plateau resulting from the hydrolysis of Zn2+ releasing protons when the proton concentration decreases to the point of Zn(OH)2 generation. This work provides a better understanding of the dissolution/deposition mechanism of Zn||MnO2 and paves the way for the practical application of manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries. It also provides a comprehensive method to study the mechanism of electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Precise Engineering of Asymmetric Tri&#8208;Active Sites by Symbiotic Strategy for Photocontrolled Directional Reforming of Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symbiotic strategy is proposed by DFT predictions for the rational design of CuxTiO2 SACs. The Cu SAs are introduced to form an asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ti structure, which significantly enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and HMF on the catalyst. This strategy achieves the targeted oxidation of HMF to DFF and FDCA through effective microenvironmental modulation.








Abstract
Sunlight&#8208;driven production of high&#8208;value chemicals from renewable resources represents a pivotal driver toward achieving sustainable energy supply. However, fundamental barriers include inadequate use of light energy and insufficient understanding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulating mechanisms in photocatalytic processes. To address this, a novel symbiotic strategy for the design of Cux/TiO2 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations was proposed. The developed catalyst achieved nearly 100% conversion and selectivity for the directional photooxidative transformation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) or 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) under both vis&#8208;light and UV&#8211;vis light conditions. Importantly, compared to previous works, this catalyst exhibited the highest photooxidation activity reported to date while effectively suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of HMF to CO2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that rational construction of Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) could effectively create the asymmetric Cu&#8211;Ov&#8211;Ti structure, which significantly enhanced the activation of O2 and HMF, facilitating generation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) and Ti3+. Furthermore, Cu SAs served as hole (h+) extractors in the photooxidation process, promoting rapid charge carrier transfer and ROS formation. The applicability of this developed strategy was further demonstrated for photooxidative conversion of various bio&#8208;feedstocks, including HMF and alcoholic substrates, indicating its great potential for harnessing light energy for sustainable valorization of biomass into high&#8208;value chemicals.

         <title>Ordered Co&#8208;Assembly of Soft&#8208;in&#8208;Hard Hetero&#8208;Structured Pulse Guidance Ion&#8208;Accelerator for Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>

A strategy to construct pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator by ordered co&#8208;assembly of block copolymer and metal&#8208;organic framework is proposed to sequentially combine zincophilic and zincophobic properties. Multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure accelerates zinc migration and desolvation processes, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling stability to 1900 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 5200 cycles.








Abstract
Constructing a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer to suppress dendrite growth is an effective approach in Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries. Traditional SEI layers are limited by their simple structure and composition, enabling only one functionality of either providing nucleation sites or facilitating desolvation. In this study, a pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator is constructed by kinetics&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembly of zincophilic micelles and zincophobic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The closely packed soft micelles, in conjunction with the hard MOF host particles, form a multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure that accelerates adsorption, pre&#8208;desolvation, and subsequent desolvation processes, facilitating the (002) crystal plane dendrite&#8208;free deposition. As a result, stable cycling over 1900 h (31&#160;mV polarization) in symmetric cell and 5200 cycles in the Zn//Cu battery (99.8% coulombic efficiency) can be achieved. These findings will effectively promote the development of stable and long&#8208;cycling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Scalable and Ultrathin Dual Entangled Network Polymer Electrolytes for Safe Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 9.7&#160;&#181;m ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;network polymer electrolyte with a decent voltage tolerance, improved tensile strength, and higher thermal stability was manufactured for safer sodium&#8208;metal batteries, in which the ether&#8208;oxygen segments were complexed with sodium ions, and the electronegative channels formed by the carbonyl and cyanogen groups acted as sodium ion transport channels to accelerate ion migration.








Abstract
Identifying ultrathin and flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance is crucial for scale&#8208;up production of solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) metal batteries (SSMBs). However, the challenges of poor processing scalability, insufficient intrinsic mechanical strength, and limited ionic transport capacity remain unaddressed. Herein, an ultrathin 9.7&#160;&#181;m solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane featuring a dual&#8208;polymer entangled network is meticulously engineered through an arrayed multi&#8208;nozzle electrospinning technique with a swelling and hot pressing process using polyacrylonitrile and poly(ether&#8208;block&#8208;amide), which exhibits an exceptional voltage tolerance, enhanced tensile strength, and superior thermal stability. The soft ether oxygens segments in multiblock copolymers complex with Na+ to promote the rapid hopping transport of Na+. Meanwhile, interconnected electronegative channels based on carbonyl and cyanogen groups serve as Na+ conduits to smooth ion fluctuations and accelerate Na+ selective conduction simultaneously. The obtained inorganic&#8208;organic composite solid electrolyte interface with the improved mechanical strength of ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolytes effectively suppresses Na dendrites with low overpotential over 500&#160;h. The solid&#8208;state cells paired with layered oxides deliver a capacity retention of over 91.1% between 25&#160;&#176;C and 65&#160;&#176;C, and assembled pouch cells exhibit impressive energy density over 100 cycles, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale application of ultrathin structure in the SSMBs.

         <title>Synergistic C&#9472;N Coupling for Efficient Cyclohexanone Oxime Synthesis from Ambient Air by Supported Molecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 26, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular catalyst is demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions. The mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity are the best known to date in H&#8208;cell. The whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal the intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH catalytic reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The unprecedented results obtained offer an ideal platform for the benign, economical, and sustainable production of cyclohexanone oxime as an alternative to the current existing processes. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from rich nitrogen resources is a promising alternative to traditional industrial processes. However, the difficulties in unraveling atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanisms and managing selective C&#9472;N coupling still pose great challenges to realizing considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C&#9472;N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. In the present work, molecular catalysts are demonstrated to be unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e., iron bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP (multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber paper) cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2&#8722; and cyclohexanone, attaining mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.3%, and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H&#8208;cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8722;, and catalyzed selective NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH reduction for C&#9472;N bond in situ. The in&#8208;depth understanding of substrate&#8208;catalyst interactions and synergic C&#9472;N coupling from molecular points of view offers valuable insights to boost collaborative synthesis of organic nitrogen compounds. Further integrating plasma&#8208;driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 on the FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode, and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected to be profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8722;1, which is much lower than the breakeven point (&#8764;$10&#160;000 ton&#8722;1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.

         <title>Guideline for Analysis and Prevention of Contamination Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Ongoing efforts to discover new catalysts in coupling reactions have provided an effective toolkit for chemists over the last decades. However, metal impurities often lead to costly misinterpretations and reproducibility issues. Our guideline provides a practical roadmap for identifying true catalysts, eliminating impurity&#8208;driven errors, and ensuring reliable research outcomes. Designed primarily for handling trace metal challenges, this framework sets a new standard for robust, impurity&#8208;free catalyst discovery. 








Abstract
Over the last decades, numerous efforts have been made to replace metal catalysts with cheaper and earth&#8208;abundant alternatives or to completely exclude metals from cross&#8208;coupling reactions while maintaining high efficiency in the target transformation. However, follow&#8208;up studies often revealed the role of metal impurities in the catalytic process. Thus, active metal impurities can lead to mechanistic misinterpretations, and these could initiate erroneous research directives and lead to severe reproducibility problems. Milestone precedents of the impurity effect in cross&#8208;coupling reactions are well documented in the literature. Interestingly, this fallacy has reoccurred repeatedly over the years due to a lack of thorough mechanistic studies and appropriate research study schemes for identifying impurity effects. Herein, we propose a guideline to elucidate the real catalyst of future catalytic transformations, aiming to reveal the correct mechanism and help exclude the role of impurities in novel catalytic processes. Although this guideline mainly focuses on problems related to trace transition metals, it also offers the basis for more general catalyst research.
