      <title>An Intelligent DNA Nanorobot for Autonomous Anticoagulation</title>
      <dc:description>Artificial nanorobots that can recognize molecular triggers and respond with programable operations provide an inspiring proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for personalized theragnostic applications. Herein, we construct an intelligent DNA nanorobot for autonomous blood anticoagulation in human plasma. The DNA nanorobot comprises a barrel&#8208;shaped DNA nanostructure as the framework and molecular reaction cascades embedded as the computing core. This nanorobot can intelligently sense the concentration of thrombin in the local environment and trigger an autonomous anticoagulation when excess thrombin is present. The triggering concentration of thrombin at which the nanorobot responds can be tuned arbitrarily to avoid possible side effects induced by excess thrombin. This makes the nanorobot useful for autonomous anticoagulation in various medical scenarios and inspires a more efficient and safer strategy for future personalized medicine.</dc:description>

      <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging to Reveal Mitochondrial Nucleoprotein Dynamics with Reactive Oxygen Species Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the biomolecular interactions in a specific organelle has been a long&#8208;standing challenge because it requires super&#8208;resolution imaging to resolve the spatial locations and dynamic interactions of multiple biomacromolecules. Two key difficulties, however, are that molecular probes suitable for super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy are rather rare, and more adversely the use of multiple probes complicates their cellular uptakes, biodistributions, and spectral distinctions. Here, we report a quinolinium derivative probe that is selectively enriched in mitochondria, and switches on in three different fluorescence modes in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), protein, and nucleic acid, enabling the visualization of mitochondrial nucleoprotein dynamics. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy reveals that the proteins localize at mitochondrial cristae and largely fuse with nucleic acids to form nucleoproteins, whereas increasing H2O2 level leads to disassociation of nucleic acid&#8208;protein complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Why Boron Nitride is such a Selective Catalyst for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, boron&#8208;containing materials and in particular boron nitride, have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes such as propane. Until now, no mechanism exists that can explain both the unprecedented selectivity, the observed surface oxyfunctionalization, as well as the peculiar kinetic features of the reaction.&#160;&#160;In this contribution we combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. Based on our results, we argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface&#8208;mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Based on known radical propagation steps, we quantitatively describe the oxygen pressure&#8208;dependent relative formation of the main product propylene and by&#8208;product ethylene. The free radical intermediates are most likely what differentiates this catalytic system from less selective vanadium&#8208;based catalysts. Indeed, although the mechanism of this benchmark catalyst is also not yet unambiguously established, it is generally assumed that radical intermediates are rapidly converted to stable molecular products on the catalyst surface before they can desorb. The new insights obtained in this work highlight the importance of the mechanistic differences between these two catalyst families which could lead to better design principles and improved catalytic systems.</dc:description>

      <title>A far&#8208;red fluorescent chemogenetic reporter for in vivo molecular imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Far&#8208;red emitting fluorescent labels are highly desirable for spectral multiplexing and deep tissue imaging. Here, we describe the generation of frFAST (far&#8208;red Fluorescence Activating and absorption Shifting Tag), a 14&#8208;kDa monomeric protein that forms a bright far&#8208;red fluorescent assembly with (4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;phenyl)allylidene rhodanine (HPAR&#8208;3OM). As HPAR&#8208;3OM is essentially non&#8208; fluorescent in solution and in cells, frFAST can be imaged with high contrast in presence of free HPAR&#8208;3OM, which allowed the rapid and efficient imaging of frFAST fusions in live cells, zebrafish embryo/larvae and chicken embryo. Beyond enabling genetic encoding of far&#8208;red fluorescence, frFAST allowed the design of a far&#8208; red chemogenetic reporter of protein&#8208;protein interactions, demonstrating its great potential for the design of innovative far&#8208;red emitting biosensors.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic features of transition states for &#946;&#8208;scission reactions of alkenes over acid zeolites revealed by AIMD simulations</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolite&#8208;catalyzed alkene cracking is key to optimize the size of hydrocarbons. The nature and stability of intermediates and transition states (TS) are, however, still debated. Herein, transition path sampling and blue moon ensemble density functional theory simulations are combined to unravel the behavior of C7 alkenes in CHA zeolite. Free energy profiles are determined, linking &#960;&#8208;complexes, alkoxides and carbenium ions, for B1 (secondary to tertiary) and B2 (tertiary to secondary) &#946;&#8208;scissions. B1 is found to be easier than B2. The TS for B1 occurs at the breaking of the C&#8208;C bond, while for B2 it is the proton transfer from propenium to the zeolite. We highlight the dynamic behaviors of the various intermediates along both pathways, which reduce activation energies with respect to those previously evaluated by static approaches. We finally revisit the ranking of isomerization and cracking rate constants, which are crucial for future kinetic studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Revisiting the Intriguing Electronic Features of the BeOBeC Carbyne and Some Isomers: A Quantum&#8208;Chemical Assessment</title>
      <dc:description>Extensive high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations reveal that the rod&#8208;shaped molecule BeOBeC, which was recently generated in matrix experiments, features two nearly isoenergetic 5&#931; quintet (56) and 3&#931; triplet (36) states. Their IR features are hardly distinguishable at finite temperature. The major difference concerns the mode of spin coupling between the terminal beryllium and carbon atoms. Further, the ground&#8208;state potential&#8208;energy surface of the [2Be,C,O] system at 4K is presented and differences between the photochemical and thermal behaviors are highlighted. Finally, a previously not considered, so far unknown C2v&#8208;symmetric rhombus&#8208;like four&#8208;membered ring 3[Be(O)(C)Be] (35) is predicted to represent the global minimum on the potential&#8208;energy surface.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extensive high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations reveal that the rod&#8208;shaped molecule BeOBeC, which was recently generated in matrix experiments, features two nearly isoenergetic 5&#931; quintet (56) and 3&#931; triplet (36) states. Their IR features are hardly distinguishable at finite temperature. The major difference concerns the mode of spin coupling between the terminal beryllium and carbon atoms. Further, the ground&#8208;state potential&#8208;energy surface of the [2Be,C,O] system at 4K is presented and differences between the photochemical and thermal behaviors are highlighted. Finally, a previously not considered, so far unknown C2v&#8208;symmetric rhombus&#8208;like four&#8208;membered ring 3[Be(O)(C)Be] (35) is predicted to represent the global minimum on the potential&#8208;energy surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A High Performing Zn&#8208;ion Battery Cathode Enabled by in&#8208;situ Transformation of V2O5 Atomic Layers</title>
      <dc:description>Developing high capacity and stable cathodes is a key to successful commercialization of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs).

      <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Conversion of a Paramagnetic FeCo Complex into a Molecular Magnetic Switch with Tuneable Hysteresis</title>
      <dc:description>A key challenge in the design of magnetic molecular switches is to obtain bistability at room temperature. Here, we show that a moderate pressure allows converting a paramagnetic Fe  III  2  Co  II  2  square complex into a molecular switch exhibiting a full dia&#8208; to para&#8208;magnetic transition: Fe  II  Co  III  &#11012; Fe  III  Co  II  . Moreover, the complex follows a rare behavior: the higher the pressure is, the broader the magnetic hysteresis is. Thus, the application of an adequate pressure allows inducing a magnetic bi&#8208;stability at room temperature with predictable hysteresis width. The structural studies at different pressures suggest that the pressure&#8208;enhanced bi&#8208;stability is due to the strengthening of intermolecular interactions upon pressure increase. An original microscopic Ising&#8208;like model including pressure effects, is developed to simulate this unprecedented behavior. Overall, this study shows that FeCo complexes could be very sensitive piezo&#8208;switches with potential use as sensors.</dc:description>

      <title>Oligomeric Cucurbituril Complexes: from Peculiar Assemblies to Emerging Applications.</title>
      <dc:description>Proteins are an endless source of inspiration. By carefully tuning the amino&#8208;acid sequence of proteins, nature made them evolve from primary to quaternary structures, a property specific to protein oligomers and often crucial to accomplish their function. On the other hand, the synthetic macrocycles cucurbiturils (CBs) have shown outstanding recognition properties in water, and a growing number of (host)  n  :(guest)  n  supramolecular polymers involving CBs have been reported. However, the burgeoning field of discrete (n:n) host:guest oligomers has just started to attract attention. While 2:2 complexes are the major oligomers, 3:3 and up to 6:6 oligomers have been described, some associated with emerging applications, specific to the (n:n) arrangements. Design rules to target (n:n) host:guest oligomers are proposed toward new advanced host:guest systems.</dc:description>

On the other hand, the synthetic macrocycles cucurbiturils (CBs) have shown outstanding recognition properties in water, and a growing number of (host)  n  :(guest)  n  supramolecular polymers involving CBs have been reported. However, the burgeoning field of discrete (n:n) host:guest oligomers has just started to attract attention. While 2:2 complexes are the major oligomers, 3:3 and up to 6:6 oligomers have been described, some associated with emerging applications, specific to the (n:n) arrangements. Design rules to target (n:n) host:guest oligomers are proposed toward new advanced host:guest systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule memory element&#160;is&#160;electrically&#8208;controlled&#160;using two distinct reaction mechanisms as reported by K. Moth&#8208;Poulsen, J. Hihath, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002300). By using separate electrically&#8208;controllable reactions for the forward and reverse reactions the bistable norbornadiene&#8211;quadricyclane system can be set in either state. The device can be switched through multiple cycles when a square&#8208;wave voltage signal is applied to the molecule. Each state has a unique conductance value allowing the system to act as a switch or memory device.&#160;

Escaping from the planar geometry of trivalent boron Lewis acids is possible by incorporating a boron atom at the edge of the triptycene scaffold.

Berionni and co&#8208;workers describe the preparation of the elusive 9&#8208;boratriptycene, a triarylborane with unprecedented structure and high Lewis acidity, due to the very low reorganization energy of the triptycene core and the absence of conjugation of its B atom orbitals with the orthogonally oriented aryl rings.

Just like a horse capturing a pawn to win the position at a chess game, nitrogen&#8208;centered radical selectivity for hydrogen atom abstraction allows for a novel directed aliphatic C&#8722;H fluorination methodology. As described by D. Bafaluy, Z. Georgieva, and K. Mu&#241;iz in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202004902), the unique and outstanding performance of halogen catalysis enables the use of simple fluoride as fluorine source in a homogeneous approach to 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;fluoroamines.

Surfactant&#8208;directed functionalization is a promising tool for enabling targeted modification of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials and open up a whole new spectrum of exciting chemistry to be explored. As demonstrated by C. Backes et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202005730), investigation of the heterogenous reaction of chloroauric acid at the nanosheet&#8211;solution interface reveals that the surfactant plays a significant role in governing the reactivity of the nanomaterial and consequently determines the outcome of the functionalization.

&lt;p&gt;Surfactant&#8208;directed functionalization is a promising tool for enabling targeted modification of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials and open up a whole new spectrum of exciting chemistry to be explored. As demonstrated by C. Backes et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200573010.1002/anie.202005730&lt;/a&gt;), investigation of the heterogenous reaction of chloroauric acid at the nanosheet&#8211;solution interface reveals that the surfactant plays a significant role in governing the reactivity of the nanomaterial and consequently determines the outcome of the functionalization.

      <title>Highly Selective Removal of Perfluorinated Contaminants by Adsorption on All&#8208;Silica Zeolite Beta</title>
      <dc:description>
Perfluorinated compounds have found wide applications but have adverse effects on health and environment. There is a need to selectively recover them from process and surface waters. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002953), D.&#8197;E. De&#8197;Vos et&#8197;al. show that a microporous zeolite Beta, in its all&#8208;silica form, shows outstanding capacity and affinity for the uptake of PFCs like perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, even in the presence of other organics.

      <title>Infrared Spectrum of the Adamantane+&#8211;Water Cation: Hydration&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Free Internal Water Rotation</title>
      <dc:description>
C&#8722;H bond activation of the Jahn&#8211;Teller distorted adamantane cation by a single H2O molecule is probed by IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations in the Research Article by O. Dopfer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003637). The results provide a quantitative molecular level understanding of the initial activation by a single polar solvent molecule in the radical cation mechanism for functionalization of diamondoids. A drastic C&#8722;H stretch frequency shift along with quasi&#8208;free internal rotation of the H2O ligand is observed.

      <title>Experimental and Computational Investigations of the Reaction between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Lactones and 1,3&#8208;Dienes by Cooperative Lewis&#8208;Acid/Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactones with activated dienes such as 1,3&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)oxy]&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (Brassard's diene) are barely known in literature and show high potential for the synthesis of isocoumarin moieties. An in&#8208;depth investigation of this reaction proved a stepwise mechanism via the vinylogous Michael&#8208;products. Subsequent cyclisation and oxidation by LHMDS and DDQ, respectively, provided six mellein derivatives (30&#8208;84%) and four angelicoin derivatives (40&#8208;78%) over three steps.

      <title>Interlocked DNA nano&#8208;joints for reversible thermal sensing</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to precisely measure and monitor temperature at high resolution at the nanoscale is an important task for better understanding the thermodynamic properties of functional entities at the nanoscale in complex systems, or at the level of a single cell. However, the development of high&#8208;resolution and robust thermal nano&#8208;sensors is challenging. Here we describe the design, assembly and characterization of a group of thermal&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;joints which consist of two interlocked double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) rings. The described DNA nano&#8208;joint can reversibly switch between the static and mobile state at different temperatures without a special annealing process. The temperature response range of the DNA nano&#8208;joint can be easily tuned by changing the length or the sequence of the hybridized region in its structure, and due to its interlocked structure, the temperature response range of the DNA nano&#8208;joint is largely unaffected by its own concentration, which is different from systems that consist of separated components.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Activity Organocatalysts for Synthesis of Polyether via Intramolecular Ammonium Cation&#8208;Assisted SN2 Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Current metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of epoxides for polyether production suffers from low catalytic efficiency and stubborn metal residue. Herein, we communicate a kind of bifunctional organocatalyst that has unprecedented reactivity for synthesis of polyether under mild conditions. Our bifunctional organoboron catalyst incorporates two 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane&#160; complexing boron centers on the both sides as Lewis&#8208;acid sites for epoxides activation and a quaternary ammonium halide in the middle place as initiating site. The catalysts could be easily scaled up to kilogram scale with ~100% yield via two steps using commercially available stocks. The organoboron catalyst&#8208;mediated ROP of epoxides displays high reactivity with living behavior with low catalyst loading (5 ppm) and enables the synthesis of polyethers with molecular weight over million grams per mole (&gt;106  g/mol). The turnover numbers of PO and EO reach up to 56,500 and 200,000, respectively. Based on the investigations on crystal structure of catalyst, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and  11B NMR, an intramolecular ammonium cation&#8208;assisted SN2 mechanism is proposed, and a deeper understanding on the mechanism is uncovered by DFT calculations</dc:description>

      <title>Hypoxia&#8208;instructed pro&#8208;protein therapy assisted with self&#8208;catalyzed nanozymogen</title>
      <dc:description>The success of intracellular protein therapy demands potent intracellular delivery efficiency and selective protein activity in diseased cells. To fulfil these requirements, a cascaded nanozymogen incorporating hypoxia&#8208;instructed pro&#8208;protein engineering and hypoxia&#8208;strengthened intracellular protein delivery was developed. RPAB, a pro&#8208;protein of RNase A reversibly caged with hypoxia&#8208;cleavable azobenzene yet deprived of the enzymatic activity, was designed and co&#8208;delivered with glucose oxidase (GOx) using hypoxia&#8208;dissociable nanocomplexes (NCs) consisting of azobenzene&#8208;cross&#8208;linked oligoethylenimine (AOEI) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Upon NCs&#8208;mediated tumor targeting, cancer cell internalization, and endolysosomal escape, GOx catalyzed intracellular glucose decomposition and aggravated tumoral hypoxia, which drove the recovery of RPAB back to the hydrolytically active RNase and concurrently expedited the degradation of AOEI to release more protein cargoes. Thus, the catalytic reaction of the nanozymogen was self&#8208;accelerated and self&#8208;cycled, ultimately leading to cooperative anti&#8208;cancer efficacies between GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy and RNase&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;apoptotic therapy. This study represents the first example of hypoxia&#8208;instructed pro&#8208;protein engineering, which expands the available chemical tools for the conditional control over protein functions. The self&#8208;catalyzed nanozymogen design also provides an effective strategy to mediate intracellular protein delivery and highly sensitive and selective intracellular pro&#8208;protein activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Proving and Probing the Presence of the Elusive C&#8208;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O Hydrogen Bond in Liquid Solutions at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) play a major role in defining the structure and properties of many substances, as well as phenomena and processes. Traditional H&#8208;bonds are ubiquitous in nature and have received considerable attention, yet the demonstration of weak H&#8208;bonds, as occur between a highly polarized C&#8208;H group and an electron&#8208;rich oxygen atom, have proven elusive. Herein, we detail linear and non&#8208;linear IR spectroscopy experiments that reveal the presence of H&#8208;bonds between the chloroform C&#8208;H group and an amide carbonyl oxygen, in solution at room temperature. Evidence is provided for an amide solvation shell featuring two clearly distinguishable chloroform arrangements that undergo chemical exchange with a time scale of ~2 ps. Furthermore, the enthalpy of breaking the hydrogen bond is found to be 6&#8208;20 kJ/mol. &#160;Ab&#8208;initio computations support our findings of two distinct solvation shells formed by three chloroform molecules, where one thermally undergoes hydrogen bond making and breaking.

      <title>Highly Concentrated Electrolyte towards Enhanced Energy Density and Cycling Life of Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have attracted much attention owing to their low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;voltage, and environmental friendliness. As the source of active ions during the charging/discharging process, the electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of DIBs, including capacity, energy density, and cycling life. However, most used electrolyte systems based on the LiPF  6  salt shows unsatisfied performance in DIBs. In this work, we successfully developed a 7.5 m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in carbonate electrolyte system. Compared with diluted electrolytes, this highly concentrated electrolyte exhibits several advantages: (1) enhanced intercalation capacity and cycling stability of graphite cathode; (2) optimized structural stability of Al anode; (3) significantly increased battery energy density. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DIB based on this concentrated electrolyte exhibits a discharge capacity of 94.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 200 mA g  &#8208;1  and 96.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. By counting both the electrode materials and electrolyte, the energy density of this pro&#8208;type DIB reaches up to ~180 Wh kg  &#8208;1  , which is among the best performance of previously reported DIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>4&#8208;Dimensional DNA&#8208;gold nanoparticle assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Although utilizing oligonucleotides to organize gold nanoobjects has resulted in many three dimensional colloidal assemblies that show a large diversity in size, shape and complexity, autonomous and temporal control of their formation is still a great challenge. In contrast, living systems temporally and spatially self&#8208;regulate the formation of functional structures by internally orchestrating assembly and disassembly kinetics of dissipative biomacromolecular networks. Taking such systems from nature as inspiration, we herein present a novel approach for fabricating 4&#8208;dimensional gold nanostructures by adding an additional dimension of structural information, i.e. the time component. The dissipative character of our system was achieved by utilizing DNA as the fuel and exonuclease III (Exo III) digestion of this DNA fuel as energy dissipating pathway. We showed the central concept of the temporal control over amorphous clusters composed of spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and well&#8208;defined core&#8208;satellite structures from gold nanorods (AuNRs) and AuNPs. Furthermore, the high specificity of DNA hybridization allowed us to demonstrate selective activation of the evolution of multiple architectures of higher complexity in a single mixture containing small and larger spherical AuNPs and AuNRs, proving the outstanding opportunities of DNA acting as a programmable fuel. We anticipate that the integration of time as the fourth dimension in existing 3D assembly systems will fuel the development of next generation of adaptive and life&#8208;like programmable DNA templated gold nanoobjects.</dc:description>

      <title>Two Pyrophosphates with Large Birefringences and Second&#8208;Harmonic Responses as Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Two new pyrophosphates nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, Rb3PbBi(P2O7)2 (I) and Cs3PbBi(P2O7)2 (II), were successfully designed and synthesized. Both compounds exhibit large nonlinear optical (NLO) effects and birefringences. Especially, I presents the scarce case of possessing the coexistence of large birefringence (0.031 at 1064 nm and 0.037 at 532 nm) and second harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.8 &#215; KDP) in ultraviolet (UV) NLO phosphates and breaks through the zero pyrophosphates with large SHG (&gt;2 &#215; KDP). Both I and II have three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystal structures composed of corner&#8208;shared RbO12 (CsO11), RbO10 (CsO10), BiO6, PbO7 (PbO6) and P2O7 groups, in which P2O7 and PbO7 (PbO6) units form alveolate [PbPO]&#8734; skeleton frame. Theoretical calculations reveal that the P&#8208;O and Bi&#8208;O units are mainly responsible for the birefringence, while P&#8208;O and Pb&#8208;O groups are essential for large SHG efficiency for I.</dc:description>

      <title>The mineral/water interface probed with nonlinear optical spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The interaction between minerals and water is relevant for a wide range of geological, atmospheric, environmental, and electro(photo&#8208;)chemical systems. This interaction is manifold and complex: the mineral surface can be (de&#8208;)protonated by water, thereby changing its charge, and thus the interaction with water; mineral ions dissolved into the aqueous phase screen the surface charges, also modifying the water interaction. Intrinsically molecular&#8208;level processes and interactions thus govern macroscopic phenomena such as flow&#8208;induced dissolution, wetting, and charging.

      <title>An RCM&#8208;Based Total Synthesis of the Antibiotic Disciformycin B</title>
      <dc:description>The total synthesis of the potent new antibiotic disciformycin B (2) is described, which shows significant activity against methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/VRSA) strains. The synthetic route is based on macrocyclization of a tetraene substrate to the 12&#8208;membered macrolactone core by ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis (RCM). Although macrocyclization was accompanied by concomitant cyclopentene formation by an alternative RCM pathway, conditions could eventually be established that gave the macrocycle as the major product.

      <title>Delivery of&#160;myo&#8208;inositol hexakisphosphate to the cell nucleus with a proline&#8208;based cell penetrating peptide</title>
      <dc:description>Inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) is a central member of the inositol phosphate messengers in eukaryotic cells. Tools to manipulate the level of InsP6, particularly with compartment selectivity, are needed to enable functional cellular studies.

      <title>Template&#8208;directed copying of RNA by non&#8208;enzymatic ligation</title>
      <dc:description>The non&#8208;enzymatic replication of the primordial genetic material is thought to have enabled the evolution of early forms of RNA&#8208;based life. However, the replication of oligonucleotides long enough to encode catalytic functions is problematic due to the low efficiency of template copying with mononucleotides. Here we show that template&#8208;directed ligation can assemble long RNAs from shorter oligonucleotides, which would be easier to replicate. The rate of ligation can be greatly enhanced by employing a 3&#697;&#8208;amino group at the 3&#697;&#8208;end of each oligonucleotide, in combination with an N&#8208;alkyl imidazole organocatalyst. These modifications enable the copying of RNA templates by the multi&#8208;step ligation of tetranucleotide building blocks, as well as the assembly of long oligonucleotides using short splint oligonucleotides. We also demonstrate the formation of long oligonucleotides inside model prebiotic vesicles, suggesting a potential route to the assembly of artificial cells capable of evolution.</dc:description>

      <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite Y via a Combined Strategy of In Situ Hydroxyl Radical Assistance and Post&#8208;Synthesis Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolite Y with high SiO  2  /Al  2  O  3  ratio (SAR) plays an important role in fluidized catalytic cracking process. However, in situ synthesis of zeolite Y with high SAR remains challenges due to kinetic limitations. Herein, zeolite Y with SAR of 6.35 was first synthesized via a hydroxyl radical&#8208;assisted route coupled with post&#8208;synthesis treatment, where hydrogen peroxide was used as the initiator of hydroxyl radicals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that hydroxyl radicals preferentially enhanced the formation of Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonds, thus leading to an increased SAR. To further increase SAR, a dealumination process was carried out by citric acid followed by second&#8208;step hydrothermal crystallization, giving SAR up to 7.5 while maintaining good crystallinity and high product yield. The resultant zeolite Y showed superior performance in cumene cracking. This work introduces a new strategy for synthesizing high SAR zeolite Y that is heavily used in commercial applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Through Crossing Potential Energy Surfaces: Cyclization of a Triplet 2&#8208;Formylarylnitrene to a Singlet 2,1&#8208;Benzisoxazole</title>
      <dc:description>Not long ago, the occurrence of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) chemistry involving atoms heavier than hydrogen was considered unreasonable. Contributing to the shift of this paradigm, we present here the discovery of a new and distinct heavy&#8208;atom QMT reaction. Triplet  syn  &#8208;2&#8208;formyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluorophenylnitrene, generated in argon matrices by UV&#8208;irradiation of an azide precursor, was found to spontaneously cyclize to singlet 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole. Monitoring the transformation by IR spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;independent rate constants (  k  ~1.4 &#215; 10  &#8722;3  s  &#8722;1  ; half&#8208;life of ~8 min) were measured from 10 to 20 K. Computations estimate rate constants in fair agreement with experimental values, providing evidence for a mechanism involving heavy&#8208;atom QMT through crossing triplet to singlet potential energy surfaces. Moreover, the heavy&#8208;atom QMT takes place with considerable displacement of the oxygen atom, which establishes a new limit for the heavier atom involved in a QMT reaction in cryogenic matrices.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermarriage of Halide Perovskites and Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>This review examines the intermarriage of perovskite and metal&#8208;organic framework crystals as bringing new paradigms for material design and functionality. The strategic combination of halide perovskites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals has generated a new family of porous composite materials that will enable new applications including optoelectronic, catalysis, sensing, and data encryption. This review surveys the current progress of this exciting new area. The fundamental aspects, including perovskite nucleation and growth, heterojunction electron&#8208;hole transfer, electronic structure and luminescence within confined spaces, are highlighted, suggesting the approaches by which guest confinement within MOFs can be synthetically designed. We further address the underlying principles and discuss the new insights and tools for the manipulation of these composite materials, pointing the way to the development of synthetic microporous semiconducting composites, as well as new strategies for host&#8208;guest interfacial engineering.</dc:description>

      <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Formation Pathway for CdTeSe Alloy Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Little is known about the pathway of room&#8208;temperature formation of ternary CdTeSe magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) obtained via mixing binary CdTe and CdSe induction period&#160;samples containing binary precursor compounds (PCs) of MSCs, monomers (Ms), and fragments (Fs). Also, unestablished are dispersion effects that occur when as&#8208;mixed samples (without incubation) are placed in toluene (Tol) and octylamine (OTA) mixtures. The resulting ternary MSCs, exhibiting sharp optical absorption peaking at 399 nm, are labelled &#8220;CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399&#8221;, and their particular PCs are &#8220;CdTeSe PC&#8208;399&#8221;. It is shown that when the amount of the primary amine (OTA) was relatively small, single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 evolved without binary CdTe or CdSe MSCs. When the OTA amount was relatively large, CdTe MSC&#8208;371 appeared initially and then disappeared, while single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 developed more deliberately. The larger the OTA amount was, the more slowly these changes proceeded. The substitution reaction of CdTe PC + CdSe M/F &#8660; CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdTe M/F is proposed to be rate&#8208;determining for the MSC&#8208;399 formation in a Tol and OTA mixture. The present study provides further understanding regarding the transformation pathway between MSCs.</dc:description>

An optimal system consists of a chemically reversible acceptor (Ru(NH 3  ) 6  3+  ), a chemically reversible photoredox catalyst (eosin Y), and a chemically irreversible donor (triethanolamine). The side reactions by O 2  do not significantly decrease the efficiency of photoredox catalysis.

      <title>Advances in the Interfacial Assembly of Mesoporous Silica on Magnetite Particles</title>
      <dc:description>
Multifaceted materials: Interface assembly enables the integration of magnetic particles and mesoporous materials to form advanced core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous materials for a variety of applications in catalysis, environmental remediation, and biomedicine. This Minireview summarizes progress made in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.







Abstract
Interfacing magnetic particles with ordered mesoporous materials is an effective direction for the development of functional porous composite materials with rationally designed core&#8211;shell structures. Owing to the combined properties of magnetic nanoparticles and mesoporous silica (high surface area, large pore volume, porosity, and biocompatibility), core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica materials have generated tremendous interest in various disciplines, including chemistry, materials, bioengineering, and biomedicine. Interfacial assembly strategies enable the rational construction of magnetic mesoporous silica materials with well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell structure, morphology, pore parameters, and surface wettability, which can decisively influence their physical and chemical properties and thus improve their application performance. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.

More light in chemistry: This Minireview highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging techniques in theoretical and computational photochemistry. This is a challenging and rapidly evolving field that relates time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy with electronic structure theory and molecular dynamics for electronic excited states.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a fascinating branch of chemistry that is concerned with molecules and light. However, the importance of simulating light&#8208;induced processes is reflected also in fields as diverse as biology, material science, and medicine. This Minireview highlights recent progress achieved in theoretical chemistry to calculate electronically excited states of molecules and simulate their photoinduced dynamics, with the aim of reaching experimental accuracy. We focus on emergent methods and give selected examples that illustrate the progress in recent years towards predicting complex electronic structures with strong correlation, calculations on large molecules, describing multichromophoric systems, and simulating non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics over long time scales, for molecules in the gas phase or in complex biological environments.

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling of Diazo Quinones with Catechol Boronic Esters</title>
      <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp  2  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bond formation reaction via the cross&#8208;coupling of diazo quinones with catechol boronic esters was developed. With this protocol, a variety of biaryls and alkenyl phenols&#160;were obtained in good to high yields under mild conditions. The reaction tolerates various functionalities and is applicable to the derivatization of pharmaceuticals and natural products. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by the short synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted triphenylenes and three bioactive natural products, honokiol, moracin M and stemofuran A. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction involves attack of the boronic ester by a singlet quinone carbene followed by a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement via a stepwise mechanism.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp  2  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) bond formation reaction via the cross&#8208;coupling of diazo quinones with catechol boronic esters was developed. With this protocol, a variety of biaryls and alkenyl phenols&#160;were obtained in good to high yields under mild conditions. The reaction tolerates various functionalities and is applicable to the derivatization of pharmaceuticals and natural products. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by the short synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted triphenylenes and three bioactive natural products, honokiol, moracin M and stemofuran A. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction involves attack of the boronic ester by a singlet quinone carbene followed by a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement via a stepwise mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Expanding the synthesis field of high silica zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Aluminosilicate zeolites are synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in basic/alkaline medium in the pH range between 9 and 14. Here we report the synthesis of MFI&#8208;type zeolite in acidic medium. The critical parameter determining the zeolite formation in acidic medium was found to be the isoelectric point (IEP) of gel particles. MFI&#8208;type zeolite was synthesized above the isoelectric point of the employed silica source, where the silica species exhibit a negative charge and the paradigm of zeolite formation based on the electros   tatic interaction with the posit   iv   ely charged template retained. No zeolite formation is observed below the isoelectric point of silica. The impact of aluminum on the zeolite formation is also studied. The results of this study will serve to extend the zeolite synthesis field of high silica zeolites to the acidic medium and thus open new opportunities to control the zeolite properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Synergistic Activation of Amides and Hydrocarbons for Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H Acylation Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The utilizations of omnipresent, thermodynamically stable amides and aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds for various functionalizations are ongoing challenges in catalysis. In particular, the direct coupling between the two functional groups has not been realized. Here, we report the synergistic activation of the two challenging bonds, the amide C&#8211;N and unactivated aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H, via metallaphotoredox catalysis to directly acylate aliphatic C&#8211;H bond utilizing amides as stable and readily accessible acyl surrogates. N&#8208;acylsuccinimides served as efficient acyl reagents for the streamlined synthesis of synthetically useful ketones from simple C(sp3)&#8211;H substrates. Detailed mechanistic investigations using both computational and experimental mechanistic studies were performed to construct a detailed and complete catalytic cycle. The origin of the superior reactivity of the N&#8208;acylsuccinimides over other more reactive acyl sources such as acyl chlorides was found to be an uncommon reaction pathway which commences with C&#8211;H activation prior to oxidative addition of the acyl substrate.</dc:description>

      <title>Regeneration of burnt&#8208;bridges on a DNA catenane walker</title>
      <dc:description>DNA walkers are molecular machines that can move with high precision in the nanoscale due to their structural and functional programmability. Despite recent advances in the field that allow exploring different energy sources, stimuli and mechanism of action for these nanomachines, continuous operation and re&#8208;usability of DNA walkers remains challenging because in most cases the steps, once taken by the walker, cannot be taken again. Herein we report the path regeneration of a burnt&#8208;bridges DNA catenane walker using RNase A. This walker uses a T7RNA polymerase that produces long RNA transcripts to hybridize to the path and move forward while the RNA remains hybridized to the path and blocks it for an additional walking cycle. We show that RNase A triggered RNA degradation restores the path and returns the walker to the initial position. RNase inhibition restarts the function of the walker. To date there is no similar strategy allowing the regeneration and continuous operation of burnt bridges DNA walkers. Our approach opens new avenues to expand the functionalities and applications of this type of artificial molecular motors.</dc:description>

The complex displays efficient energy transfer from the central cyanine dye to the surrounding zinc porphyrin nanoring.
