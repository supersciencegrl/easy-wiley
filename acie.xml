      <title>Carboxyboronate as a Versatile in situ CO surrogate in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>The application of carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate as an in situ CO surrogate for various palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations is described. Carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate was previously shown to be a bench&#8208;stable boron&#8208;containing building block for the synthesis of borylated heterocycles. The present study demonstrates that, in addition to its utility as a precursor to heterocycle synthesis, carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate is an excellent in situ CO surrogate that is tolerant of reactive functionalities such as amines, alcohols, and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. Its wide functional group compatibility is highlighted in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira coupling, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of aryl halides. A variety of amides, esters, (hetero)aromatic ynones, and bis(hetero)aryl ketones were synthesized in good to excellent yields in a one&#8208;pot fashion.</dc:description>

      <title>Delivery of a Masked Uranium(II) by an Oxide&#8208;Bridged Diuranium(III) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Oxide is an attractive linker for building polymetallic complexes that provide molecular models for metal oxides activity, but studies of these systems are limited to metals in high oxidation states. Herein, we synthesized and characterized the molecular and electronic structure of diuranium bridged U(III)/U(IV) and U(III)/U(III) complexes. Reactivity studies of these complexes revealed that the U&#8208;O bond is easily broken upon addition of N&#8208;heterocycles resulting in the delivery of a formal equivalent of U(III) and U(II), respectively, along with the uranium(IV) terminal&#8208;oxo coproduct. In particular, the U(III)/U(III) oxide complex effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and two&#8208;electron reduction of 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine affording unique examples of diuranium(III) complexes bridged by N&#8208;heterocyclic redox&#8208;active ligands. These results provide insight into the chemistry of low oxidation state metal oxides and demonstrate the use of oxo&#8208;bridged U(III)/U(III) complexes as a strategy to explore U(II) reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Regioselectivity of a P450 Monooxygenase Enables the Synthesis of Ursodeoxycholic Acid via 7&#946;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Lithocholic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>We engineered the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP107D1 (OleP) from  Streptomyces antibioticus  for the stereo&#8208; and regioselective 7&#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of lithocholic acid (LCA) to yield ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). OleP was previously shown to hydroxylate testosterone at the 7&#946;&#8208;position but LCA is exclusively hydroxylated at the 6&#946;&#8208;position, forming murideoxycholic acid (MDCA). Structural and 3DM analysis, and molecular docking were used to identify amino acid residues F84, S240, and V291 as specificity&#8208;determining residues. Alanine scanning identified S240A as a UDCA&#8208;producing variant. A synthetic 'small but smart' library based on these positions was screened using a colorimetric assay for UDCA. We identified a nearly perfectly regio&#8208; and stereoselective triple mutant (F84Q/S240A/V291G) that produces 10&#8208;fold higher levels of UDCA than the S240A variant. This biocatalyst opens up new possibilities for the environmentally friendly synthesis of UDCA from the biological waste product LCA.</dc:description>

      <title>Diarylacetnitrile as a Molecular Probe for the Detection of Polymeric Mechanoradicals in the Bulk State via a Radical Chain&#8208;transfer Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>Since the beginning of the history of polymer science, understanding the influence of mechanical stress on polymer chains has been a fundamental and important research topic. The detection of mechanoradicals generated by homolytic cleavage of the polymer chains in solution has been studied in many cases. However, the detection of mechanoradicals in the bulk is still limited due to their high reactivity. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy to detect mechanoradicals visually and quantitatively using a chain&#8208;transfer agent that generates relatively stable fluorescent radicals as a molecular probe. Mechanoradicals generated by ball milling of polystyrene samples were successfully detected by using diarylacetonitrile as a fluorescent molecular probe via this radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism. This probe enables the visualization and quantitative evaluation of mechanoradicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission.</dc:description>

Among them, double perovskites with Cs  2  AgInCl  6  composition, often doped with various elements, have been under the spotlight for their intriguing optical properties, viz., self&#8208;trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant&#8208;induced photoluminescence.

Hence, we offer this perspective on the recent developments on Cs  2  AgInCl  6  bulk crystals and nanocrystals and take a close look at their synthesis strategies, intrinsic optical properties and tunable photoluminescence originating from different alloying and doping effects.

For the intermolecular reaction with 1&#8208;arylethenes as olefin components, the scope of the reaction was studied (14 examples, 50&#8208;99% yield, 86&#8208;98%  ee  ). The absolute and relative configuration of the products were elucidated by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reaction is suggested to occur by triplet energy transfer in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1:1 complex between the imine substrate and the catalyst. The intramolecular cycloaddition, consecutive reactions of the product azetidines, and an alternative reaction mode of quinoxalinones were investigated in preliminary experiments.</dc:description>

The absolute and relative configuration of the products were elucidated by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reaction is suggested to occur by triplet energy transfer in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1:1 complex between the imine substrate and the catalyst. The intramolecular cycloaddition, consecutive reactions of the product azetidines, and an alternative reaction mode of quinoxalinones were investigated in preliminary experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>AIEgen&#8208;Lipid Conjugate for Rapid Labeling of Neutrophils and Monitoring of Their Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>Studies on neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutic engineering have shown great potentials in treating infection and inflammation disorders. Conventional neutrophil labeling methods are time&#8208;consuming and often result in undesired contamination and activation since neutrophils are terminal&#8208;differentiated cells with a half&#8208;life span of only 7 h. A simple, fast and biocompatible strategy to construct engineered neutrophils is highly desirable but remains difficult to achieve.

This fast labeling method does not affect the activation and transmigration property of neutrophils, which has been successfully used to monitor neutrophil behaviors such as the chemotaxis process and migrating function towards inflammation sites both in vitro and in vivo, offering a tantalizing prospect for neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutics studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Dearomatizing [4+1] Spiroannulation of Naphthols: Discovery of Structurally Non&#8208;Traditional Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Materials</title>
      <dc:description>The development of streamlined synthetic routes to spirofluorene derivatives, in particular those with a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, is an appealing task in the field of organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct [4+1] spiroannulation of ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts to construct spirofluorenyl naphthalenones (SFNP) under mild reaction conditions. This spiroannulation not only directly transforms the hydroxyl group into the carbonyl group, but also tolerates reactive functional groups such as the halo groups, which provide an opportunity to rapidly assemble structurally non&#8208;traditional thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials that feature a carbonyl group with an adjacent spirofluorenyl unit as the acceptor. As an illustrated example, the OLED device utilizing the assembled  DMAC&#8208;SFNP  as the host material exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5 V and an ultra&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 32.2%. This work not only gives us an inspiration for designing structurally non&#8208;traditional TADF materials, but also displays the charm of C&#8722;H activation as a revolutionary synthetic strategy in the innovation of optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Quantitative Imaging of Native Microbiota Distribution in the Gut</title>
      <dc:description>Due to the challenges to acquire detailed spatial information of gut bacteria in situ, microbiota&#8217;s three&#8208;dimensional (3D) distributions in the gut remain largely uncharted. Here, we propose a tissue clearing&#8208;based and D&#8208;amino acid labeling&#8208;facilitated (TiDaL) strategy that combines a novel microbiota in vivo labeling protocol, CUBIC&#8208;based tissue clearing and whole&#8208;mount tissue imaging, to achieve 3D imaging of indigenous gut microbiota. We demonstrate high resolution 3D acquisition of their biogeography in different gut sections, and present quantitative spatial details in relation to the host epithelium. We unexpectedly observe microbiota in the small intestine crypts which were thought to be bacteria&#8208;free. Moreover, significant bacterial overgrowth in the first two&#8208;thirds of the small intestine is detected in an enteritis model. We expect that this quantitative 3D imaging strategy for native gut microbiota will provide insightful information into the host&#8208;microbiota interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Cerium vanadate nanozyme with specific superoxide dismutase activity regulates mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis in neuronal cells</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoparticles that functionally mimic the activity of metal&#8208;containing enzymes (metallonanozymes) are of therapeutic importance to treat various diseases. However, it is still not clear whether such nanozymes can completely substitute the function of natural enzymes in living cells. In this work, we show for the first time that a cerium vanadate (CeVO  4  ) nanozyme can substitute the function of superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) in the neuronal cells even when the natural enzyme is down&#8208;regulated by specific gene silencing. The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial damage in SOD1 and SOD2&#8208;depleted cells by regulating the superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins. Further, the nanozyme effectively prevents the mitochondrial depolarization, leading to a significant improvement in the cellular levels of ATP under oxidative stress.</dc:description>

The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial damage in SOD1 and SOD2&#8208;depleted cells by regulating the superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins. Further, the nanozyme effectively prevents the mitochondrial depolarization, leading to a significant improvement in the cellular levels of ATP under oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Low Cost Industrial Organic Pigment Coating</title>
      <dc:description>Surface passivation of perovskite thin films has been established as a promising approach to improving both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). While remarkable progress has been achieved with various surface passivating agents, long&#8208;term stability of PSCs has not been fully addressed. Here, we report a new strategy for surface passivation of PSCs using a low cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA). The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl)&#8208;quinacridone (TBOC&#8208;QA), followed by facile thermal annealing to convert TBOC&#8208;QA to insoluble QA. With the halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead Iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9% recorded for the unmodified devices. Density functional theory calculations revealed strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, which effectively reduced the surface defects of halide perovskite thin films and suppressed the nonradiative recombination. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to remarkably enhanced contact angle from 35.6&#8304; for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2&#8304; for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. As a result, the stabilities of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were greatly enhanced, retaining about 90 % of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000 hours storage under ambient conditions. The universality of this passivation strategy was evaluated by extending MAPbI3 systems to triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite systems, which further confirm the effectiveness of industrial pigment passivation of PSCs with enhanced efficiency and stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Isomerization Reactions in Anionic Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Borates and Control of Properties and Reactivities in the resulting CoII Complexes through Agostic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>We present here anionic borate based bi&#8208;mesoionic carbene compounds of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidene type (with additional cyclohexyl or phenyl substituents on borate) that undergo C&#8208;N isomerization reactions. The isomerized compounds are excellent ligands for Co  II  centers. Strong agostic interactions with the &#8222;C&#8208;H&#8220;&#8208;groups of the cyclohexyl substituents result in an unusual low spin square planar Co  II  complex, which is unreactive towards external substrates. Such agostic interactions are absent in the complex with phenyl substituents on the borate backbone. That complex displays a high spin tetrahedral Co  II  center, which is reactive towards external substrates including dioxygen. A combined synthetic, crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical approach is used to investigate the compounds. We conclusively show here that the structure and properties of these Co  II  complexes can be strongly influenced through interactions in the secondary coordination sphere. Additionally, we unravel a unique ligand rearrangement for these classes of anionic mesoionic carbene based ligands.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Prodrug and drug delivery systems are two effective strategies for improving the selectivity of chemotherapeutics. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have emerged as promising carriers in targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment, but have not yet been integrated with the prodrug strategy.

Their co&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were prepared as a smart carrier. Prodrug&#8208;loaded MIP specifically and sustainably accumulated at the tumor site and then gradually released. Unlike conventional prodrug designs, which often require in&#8208;liver bioconversion, our MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent. Thus, this study opened a new access to the development of smart prodrug delivery nanoplatforms.</dc:description>

      <title>Cooperative Carbon Dioxide Adsorption in Alcoholamine&#8208; and Alkoxyalkylamine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperative CO2 chemisorption is achieved in a metal&#8211;organic framework functionalized with structurally diverse alcoholamines and alkoxyalkylamines. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that CO2 adsorption occurs via the formation and propagation of hydrogen bond&#8208;stabilized carbamic acid or ammonium carbamate structures.







Abstract
A series of structurally diverse alcoholamine&#8208; and alkoxyalkylamine&#8208;functionalized variants of the metal&#8211;organic framework Mg2(dobpdc) are shown to adsorb CO2 selectively via cooperative chain&#8208;forming mechanisms. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectra and optimized structures obtained from van der Waals&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption profiles can be attributed to the formation of carbamic acid or ammonium carbamate chains that are stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions within the framework pores. These findings significantly expand the scope of chemical functionalities that can be utilized to design cooperative CO2 adsorbents, providing further means of optimizing these powerful materials for energy&#8208;efficient CO2 separations.

      <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Torpedo&#8208;Like Persistent Luminescence Nanoparticles for Autofluorescence&#8208;Free Biosensing and High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>
      <dc:description>Persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) with intrinsic stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are highly desirable for diverse applications because of no autofluorescence background and natural responsive luminescence. However, to our knowledge, the stimuli&#8208;responsive features of pure PLNPs have been unexplored yet. Here we show a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis of green&#8208;emitting Zn2GeO4:Mn2+,Pr3+ nanoparticles (ZGMP) with regular shape, uniform size, good afterglow luminescent performance. We also report the pH stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent behavior of ZGMP and its possible mechanism. Taking the intriguing feature of pH responsive persistent luminescence, we explore ZGMP as autofluorescence&#8208;free probes to achieve stimuli&#8208;activated signal switch for biosensing by integrating enzyme catalysis reaction mediated pH modulation. The pH responsive persistent luminescence also makes ZGMP promising for high&#8208;level information encryption. This work paves the way to the design and development of stimulus&#8208;responsiveness of pure PLNPs for diverse applications.</dc:description>

      <title>The Triplet Hydroxyl Radical Complex of Phosphorus Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
A triplet radical&#8208;radical complex consisting of a hydroxyl radical and phosphorus monoxide (.OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP.), which serves as an important intermediate in the combustion of phosphines, has been captured in solid Ar&#8208;matrices at 2.8&#8197;K. Its interconversion with metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) has also been observed.







Abstract
Phosphorus monoxide (.PO) is a key intermediate in phosphorus chemistry, and its association with the hydroxyl radical (.OH) to yield metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) contributes to the chemiluminescence in the combustion of phosphines. When photolyzing cis&#8208;HOPO in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 2.8&#8197;K, the simplest dioxophosphorane HPO2 and an elusive hydroxyl radical complex (HRC) of .PO form. This prototypical radical&#8208;radical complex reforms into cis&#8208;HOPO at above 12.0&#8197;K by overcoming a barrier of 0.28&#177;0.02&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The vibrational spectra of this HRC and its D&#8208; and 18O&#8208;isotopologues suggest a structure of .OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP., for which a triplet spin multiplicity with a binding energy of &#8722;3.20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 has been computed at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level.

      <title>Coherent Vibration and Femtosecond Dynamics of the Platinum Complex Oligomers upon Intermolecular Bond Formation in the Excited State</title>
      <dc:description>
Intermolecular bond formations among Pt atoms in oligomers of PtII complexes are induced by photo&#8208;irradiation. Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption measurements for aqueous solutions of K2[Pt(CN)4] recorded clear oscillations of transient absorption in the first few picoseconds with complex dynamics. The oscillations arise from the Pt&#8722;Pt stretch motions of the S1 trimer and S1 tetramer. The analysis of the oscillations provides clear assignments of the oligomers, as described by M. Iwamura, T. Tahara et&#8197;al. their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011813).

      <title>Ion Selectivity of Water Molecules in Subnanoporous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Water&#8208;Treatment Membranes: A Structural Study of Hydrogen Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in a self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membrane obtained using soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy indicate that structural consistency among associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules contributes to ion selectivity. MgSO4 with high permeability (73&#8201;%) has hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of hydrating water closer than those of NaCl with low permeability (30&#8201;%) to those in the water&#8208;treatment membrane.







Abstract
We demonstrate hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membranes obtained using synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy. The ion selectivity of these water treatment membranes is usually understood by the size compatibility of nanochannels in the membrane with the Stokes radius of hydrated ions, or by electrostatic interaction between charges inside the nanochannels and such ions. However, based on a comparison between the hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water molecules in the nanochannels of the water treatment membrane and those surrounding the ions, we propose a definite contribution of structural consistency among the associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules to the ion selectivity. Our observation delivers a novel concept to the design of water treatment membranes where water molecules in the nanochannel can be regarded as a part of the material that controls the ion selectivity.

      <title>Bifunctional Effects of Cation Additive on Na&#8210;O2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aprotic Na&#8210;O  2  batteries have attracted growing interest due to their low overpotentials and high energy density. Their cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency are limited, however, by Na dendrite formation and superoxide (O  2  &#8208;  ) degradation. Here, we present a bifunctional cation additive, tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA  +  ), to simultaneously protect the Na anode and stabilize the superoxide. The adsorption of TBA  +  on the Na anode suppresses the dendrite formation in the Na plating and ensures stable anode cycling at high current density in both Ar and oxygen atmospheres. In addition, the aprotic Na&#8210;O  2  batteries with TBA  +  show increased Coulombic efficiency as well as good rate capability. These are rewarded by the fast desolvation kinetics of O  2  &#8208;  and suppression of the disproportionation reaction of O  2  &#8208;  with TBA  +  , as confirmed by  Ab initio  molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory calculations. This bifunctional effect of this cation additive paves a new avenue for development of Na&#8210;O  2  batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Utilization of Lanthipeptide Synthetases is a General Strategy for the Biosynthesis of 2&#8208;Aminovinyl&#8208;Cysteine Motifs in Thioamitides</title>
      <dc:description>Thioamitide natural products are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translational modified peptides (RiPPs) with potent antiproliferative and pro&#8208;apoptotic activities. Their biosynthesis remains largely unknown, especially for the characteristic C&#8208;terminal 2&#8208;aminovinyl&#8208;cysteine (AviCys) motifs. Herein, we report the discovery that homologs of class III lanthipeptide synthetases (LanKC  t  s) encoded outside putative thioamitide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) fully dehydrate the precursor peptides. Remarkably, LanKCt enzymes bind tightly to cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside thioamitide BGCs, and the resulting enzyme complex complete the macrocyclization of AviCys rings. Furthermore, our studies reveal that LanKC  t  enzymes are present in the genomes of many thioamitide&#8208;producing strains and participate in the generation of AviCys macrocycles, therefore serving as a general biosynthetic strategy. Together, our study reveals an unprecedented system that lanthipeptide synthetases outside thioamitide BGCs participate in their biosynthesis by specific association with cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside BGCs, and thus paves the way for the bioengineering of this class of bioactive natural products.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thioamitide natural products are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translational modified peptides (RiPPs) with potent antiproliferative and pro&#8208;apoptotic activities. Their biosynthesis remains largely unknown, especially for the characteristic C&#8208;terminal 2&#8208;aminovinyl&#8208;cysteine (AviCys) motifs. Herein, we report the discovery that homologs of class III lanthipeptide synthetases (LanKC  t  s) encoded outside putative thioamitide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) fully dehydrate the precursor peptides. Remarkably, LanKCt enzymes bind tightly to cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside thioamitide BGCs, and the resulting enzyme complex complete the macrocyclization of AviCys rings. Furthermore, our studies reveal that LanKC  t  enzymes are present in the genomes of many thioamitide&#8208;producing strains and participate in the generation of AviCys macrocycles, therefore serving as a general biosynthetic strategy. Together, our study reveals an unprecedented system that lanthipeptide synthetases outside thioamitide BGCs participate in their biosynthesis by specific association with cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside BGCs, and thus paves the way for the bioengineering of this class of bioactive natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sugar&#8208;Based Polymers from D&#8208;xylose: Living Cascade Polymerization, Tunable Degradation, and Small Molecule Release</title>
      <dc:description>Enyne monomers derived from D&#8208;xylose underwent living cascade polymerizations to prepare new polymers with a ring&#8208;opened sugar and degradable linkage incorporated into every repeat unit of the backbone. Polymerizations were well&#8208;controlled and had living character, which enabled the preparation of high molecular weight polymers with narrow molecular weight dispersity values and a block copolymer. By tuning the type of acid&#8208;sensitive linkage (hemi&#8208;aminal ether, acetal, or ether functional groups), we could change the degradation profile of the polymer and the identity of the resulting degradation products. For instance, the large difference in degradation rates between hemi&#8208;aminal ether&#8208; and ether&#8208;based polymers enabled the sequential degradation of a block copolymer. Furthermore, we exploited the generation of furan&#8208;based degradation products, from an acetal&#8208;based polymer, to achieve the release of covalently bound reporter molecules upon degradation.</dc:description>

      <title>The bonding and transformation of a ligand&#8208;protected gold nanohydride cluster</title>
      <dc:description>Gold is the most inert metal and does not react with H  2  to form bulk hydrides. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a gold nanohydride protected by diphosphine ligands, [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  [dppo = 1,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)octane]. The Au  22  core consists of two Au  11  units bonded by eight Au atoms not coordinated by the diphosphine ligands. The four H atoms are found to bridge the eight uncoordinated Au atoms at the interface. Each Au  11  unit can be viewed as a tetravalent superatom forming four delocalized Au&#8208;H&#8208;Au bonds, similar to the quadruple bond first discovered in the [Re  2  Cl  8  ]  2&#8211;  inorganic cluster. The [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  nanohydride is found to lose H atoms over an extended time via H combination (H  2  ), proton (H  +  ) and hydride (H  &#8211;  ) transfers. This complete repertoire of H&#8208;related transformations suggests that the [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  nanohydride is a versatile model catalyst for understanding the mechanisms of chemical reactions involving hydrogen on the surface of gold nanoparticles.</dc:description>

Furthermore, intercalation of two well&#8208;known G&#8208;quadruplex binders, PIPER and telomestatin, into G&#8208;quadruplex dimers resulting in sandwich complexes was investigated with the new method, and previously unknown binding modes were discovered.

      <title>15N NMR Hyperpolarization of Radiosensitizing Antibiotic Nimorazole via Reversible Parahydrogen Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>
      <dc:description>Nimorazole belongs to the imidazole&#8208;based family of antibiotics to fight against anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, nimorazole is now in Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe for potential use as a hypoxia radiosensitizer for treatment of head and neck cancers. We envision the use of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole as a theragnostic hypoxia contrast agent that can be potentially deployed in the next&#8208;generation MRI&#8208;LINAC systems. Here, we report the first but very important steps to create long&#8208;lasting (for tens of minutes) hyperpolarized state on three  15  N sites of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole with T  1  of up to ~6 minutes. The nuclear spin polarization was boosted by ~67000&#8208;fold at 1.4 T (corresponding to  P  15N  of 3.2%) via  15  N&#8208;  15  N spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization technique relying on simultaneous exchange of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole and parahydrogen on polarization transfer Ir&#8208;IMes catalyst. The isomeric side product of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole synthesis was hyperpolarized too. The presented results pave the way to efficient spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization of a wide range of imidazole&#8208;based antibiotics and chemotherapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of Key TIPS&#8208;Naphthalene for Efficient Visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV Photon Upconversion under Sunlight and Room Light</title>
      <dc:description>While many studies have been done on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;based photon upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) to produce visible light with high efficiency, the efficient TTA&#8208;UC from visible to UV light, despite its importance for a variety of solar and indoor applications, remains a challenging task. Here, we report the highest visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV TTA&#8208;UC efficiency of 20.5% based on the discovery of an excellent UV emitter, 1,4&#8208;bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)naphthalene (TIPS&#8208;Nph). TIPS&#8208;Nph is an acceptor with desirable features of high fluorescence quantum yield and high singlet generation efficiency by TTA. In addition, TIPS&#8208;Nph has a low enough triplet energy level to be sensitized by Ir(C6)2(acac), a superior donor that does not quench UV emission. The combination of TIPS&#8208;Nph and Ir(C6)2  (acac) realizes the efficient UV light production even with weak light sources such as an AM 1.5 solar simulator and room LEDs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Chemically modified DNA has been widely developed to fabricate various nucleic acid nanostructures for biomedical applications. Herein, we report a facile strategy for construction of branched antisense DNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) co&#8208;assembled nanoplatform for combined gene silencing in vitro and in vivo.

      <dc:description>Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting material (HTM) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs are scarce, and their molecular design principles are still unclear.

Upon incorporating rotatable or chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the pyrazine ring, the resulting molecular HTMs  TQ3  and  TQ4  show completely different molecular arrangement as well as charge transporting capabilities. Comparing with  TQ3  , the coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline based  TQ4  endows enriched intermolecular interactions and stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, thus achieving a higher hole mobility of 2.08 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  .

      <dc:description>Nowadays, the commercially available polymer donor PM6 has been applied widely in organic solar cells (OSCs) and achieved the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversation efficiencies (PCEs). To fully explore its photovoltaic potential in OSCs, fine regulating the molecular structure to further optimize the related active layer morphologies is of considerable significance. Herein, we demonstrated a simple random ternary copolymerization approach to develop a terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 by carefully incorporating the third 5,5'&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz, 20 mol%) unit into the molecular backbone of PM6 (PM6&#8208;Tz00). It is found that this method can properly tailor the molecular ordering, orientation, and aggregation properties without obviously affecting absorption and energy levels of polymer donors, and then effectively optimize the active layer morphology with a small molecule acceptor Y6, as well as the electrical properties of the related devices, ultimately improving fill factor (FF) and thus boosting PCE. As a result, the PM6&#8208;Tz20&#8208;based OSCs achieved a PCE of up to 17.1% with a significantly enhanced FF of 0.77, which is much higher than that of the controlled OSCs based on PM6 (PCE=15.7% and FF=0.72). Notable, using Ag (220 nm) instead of Al (100 nm) as cathode, the champion PCE was further improved to 17.6% due to the increase of photocurrent. These are among the best results for the binary OSCs reported to date. Our work provides a simple but effective approach to optimize blend morphologies of OSCs for higher photovoltaic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemically Tuned Oxidative [4+2] Annulation and Dioxygenation of Olefins with Hydroxamic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>This work represents the first [4+2] annulation of hydroxamic acids with olefins for the synthesis of benzo[c][1,2]oxazines scaffold via anode&#8208;selective electrochemical oxidation. This protocol features mild conditions, oxidant free, high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, broad substrates scope of both alkenes and hydroxamic acids, and is compatible with terpenes, peptides as well as steroids. Significantly, the dioxygenation of olefins employing hydroxamic acid is also successfully achieved by switching the anode material under the same reaction conditions. The study not only reveals a new reactivity of hydroxamic acids and its first application in electrosynthesis but also provides a successful example of anode material&#8208;tuned product selectivity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are the key component in solid state laser. New SHG effective halides, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2X5 (X = I, Br), have been rationally synthesized by introducing acetate groups into lead halide perovskites under moderate solvothermal conditions. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2X5 (X = I, Br) feature highly oriented anionic chains constructed by distorted [PbX4O2] (X = I, Br) polyhedrons. Both the theoretical studies and the dipole moment calculations uncover that their SHG effects are mainly originated from the distorted [PbX4O2] (X = I, Br) polyhedrons. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2I5 exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation (SHG) response (8&#215;KDP) and large birefringence (0.26@ 1064 nm). Moreover, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2X5 (X = I, Br) also possess high laser damage threshold (LDT) which are almost 27 and 41 times that of AgGaS2, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineered Coatings via the Assembly of Amino&#8208;Quinone Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Engineering coatings with precise physicochemical properties allows for control over the interface of a material and its interactions with the surrounding environment. However, assembling coatings with well&#8208;defined properties on different material classes remains a challenge. Herein, we report a co&#8208;assembly strategy to precisely control the structure and properties (e.g., thickness, adhesion, wettability, and surface potential) of coatings on various materials (27 substrates examined) using quinone and polyamine building blocks. By increasing the length of the amine building blocks from small molecule diamines to branched amine polymers, we can tune the properties of the films, including the thickness (from ~5 to ~50 nm), interfacial adhesion (0.05 to 5.54 nN), water contact angle (130 to 40&#176;), and surface potential (&#8722;42 to 28 mV). The films can be post&#8208;functionalized through the in situ formation of diverse nanostructures, including nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanocrystals.
