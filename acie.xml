         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to hypervalent iodine(III) compounds, the isoelectronic bromine(III) counterparts have been little studied to date. This knowledge gap is mainly attributed to the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control reactivity of  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromanes as well as to their challenging preparation from the highly toxic and corrosive BrF  3  precursor. In this context, we present a straightforward and scalable approach to chelation&#8208;stabilized  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromanes by anodic oxidation of parent aryl bromides possessing two coordinating hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanyl substituents. A series of  para  &#8208;substituted  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromanes with remarkably high redox potentials spanning a range from 1.86 V to 2.60 V vs. Ag/AgNO  3  was synthesized by the electrochemical method. We demonstrate that the intrinsic reactivity of the bench&#8208;stable bromine(III) species can be unlocked by addition of a Lewis or a Br&#248;nsted acid. The synthetic utility of the  &#955;  3  &#8208;bromane activation is exemplified by oxidative arene&#8208;arene homocoupling.</dc:description>

The application of catalytic hydrofunctionalization benefit from the use of liquid reducing agents and operationally facile setups. Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroborations provide a highly prolific platform for reductive valorizations of stable C=X electrophiles. Here, we report an especially facile, broad&#8208;scope reduction of various functions incl. carbonyls, carboxylates, pyridines, carbodiimides, carbonates under very mild conditions with the inexpensive pre&#8208;catalyst Mn(hmds)  2  . The reaction could be successfully applied to depolymerizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Reconfigurable DNA&#8208;Based Chemical Reaction Circuits for Soft Matter Computing and Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing smart material system for performing different tasks in diverse environments remains challenging. Here, we show that by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials with multi&#8208;mode reconfigurable DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction circuits (D&#8208;CRCs), it can control size change of microgels with multiple reaction pathways and adapt expansion behaviors to meet diverse environments. We first use pH&#8208;responsive intramolecular conformational switches for regulating DNA strand&#8208;displacement&#8208;reactions (SDRs). The ability to regulate SDRs with tunable pH&#8208;dependence allows to build dynamic chemical reaction networks with diverse reaction pathways. We confirm that the designed DNA switching circuits are reconfigurable at different pH and perform different logic operations, and the swelling of DNA switching circuit&#8208;integrated microgel systems can be programmably directed by D&#8208;CRCs. Our approach provides insight into building smart responsive materials and fabricating autonomous soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of rotational motion in diffusion NMR experiments on supramolecular assemblies: application to Sup35NM fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG) NMR is an important tool for characterization of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies. However, for micron&#8208;sized objects, such as amyloid fibrils, these experiments become difficult to interpret because in addition to translational diffusion they are also sensitive to rotational diffusion. We have constructed a mathematical theory describing the outcome of PFG NMR experiments on rod&#8208;like fibrils. To test its validity, we have studied the fibrils formed by Sup35NM segment of the prion protein Sup35. The interpretation of the PFG NMR data in this system is fully consistent with the evidence from electron microscopy. Contrary to some previously expressed views, the signals originating from disordered regions in the fibrils can be readily differentiated from the similar signals representing small soluble species (e.g. proteolytic fragments). This paves the way for diffusion&#8208;sorted NMR experiments on complex amyloidogenic samples</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Physical Oxidation State by Resonant X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy: Applications to Iron Model Complexes and Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10112-10121, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning transition&#8208;metal physical oxidation states is a major goal of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. However, competing influences of covalency and d&#8208;count on K&#946; XES spectra often make assignments ambiguous. It is now shown that resonant K&#946; X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) yields unambiguous oxidation&#8208;state determinations for iron monomers, dimers, cubanes, and metalloenzymes.







Abstract
The ability of resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to recover physical oxidation state information, which may often be ambiguous in conventional X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, is demonstrated. By combining K&#946; XES with resonant excitation in the XAS pre&#8208;edge region, resonant K&#946; XES (or 1s3p RXES) data are obtained, which probe the 3dn+1 final&#8208;state configuration. Comparison of the non&#8208;resonant and resonant XES for a series of high&#8208;spin ferrous and ferric complexes shows that oxidation state assignments that were previously unclear are now easily made. The present study spans iron tetrachlorides, iron sulfur clusters, and the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. While 1s3p RXES studies have previously been reported, to our knowledge, 1s3p RXES has not been previously utilized to resolve questions of metal valency in highly covalent systems. As such, the approach presented herein provides chemists with means to more rigorously and quantitatively address challenging electronic&#8208;structure questions.

         <title>Discovery of Cyanobacterial Natural Products Containing Fatty Acid Residues**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10064-10072, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hapalosin analogues and several 1,2,3&#8208;oxadiazine&#8208;lactylate hybrids were discovered by exploiting the apparent inability of cyanobacteria to degrade fatty acids. When supplemented with perdeuterated fatty acids, cyanobacteria incorporate their residues into secondary metabolites, which can then be swiftly detected by LC&#8208;MS analysis.







Abstract
In recent years, extensive sequencing and annotation of bacterial genomes has revealed an unexpectedly large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters whose products are yet to be discovered. For example, cyanobacterial genomes contain a variety of gene clusters that likely incorporate fatty acid derived moieties, but for most cases we lack the knowledge and tools to effectively predict or detect the encoded natural products. Here, we exploit the apparent absence of a functional &#946;&#8208;oxidation pathway in cyanobacteria to achieve efficient stable&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeling of their fatty acid derived lipidome. We show that supplementation of cyanobacterial cultures with deuterated fatty acids can be used to easily detect natural product signatures in individual strains. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated in two cultured cyanobacteria by uncovering analogues of the multidrug&#8208;resistance reverting hapalosin, and novel, cytotoxic, lactylate&#8208;nocuolin A hybrids&#8212;the nocuolactylates.

For example, cyanobacterial genomes contain a variety of gene clusters that likely incorporate fatty acid derived moieties, but for most cases we lack the knowledge and tools to effectively predict or detect the encoded natural products. Here, we exploit the apparent absence of a functional &#946;&#8208;oxidation pathway in cyanobacteria to achieve efficient stable&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeling of their fatty acid derived lipidome. We show that supplementation of cyanobacterial cultures with deuterated fatty acids can be used to easily detect natural product signatures in individual strains. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated in two cultured cyanobacteria by uncovering analogues of the multidrug&#8208;resistance reverting hapalosin, and novel, cytotoxic, lactylate&#8208;nocuolin A hybrids&#8212;the nocuolactylates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Peroxo Species Formed in the Bulk of Silicate Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10056-10063, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxo moieties formed in the bulk of carbon&#8208;coated Mn&#8208;doped Li2CoSiO4 are characterized by concurrent signatures in the form of an O&#8208;K pre&#8208;edge peak (XAS) and a peroxo O&#8211;O stretching mode (Raman). Peroxo formation proves to be a reversible oxygen redox mechanism for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes in real&#8208;world battery applications.







Abstract
Oxygen redox in Li&#8208;rich oxides may boost the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by incorporating oxygen chemistry in solid cathodes. However, oxygen redox in the bulk usually entangles with voltage hysteresis and oxygen release, resulting in a prolonged controversy in literature on oxygen transformation. Here, we report spectroscopic evidence of peroxo species formed and confined in silicate cathodes amid oxygen redox at high voltage, accompanied by Co2+/Co3+ redox dominant at low voltage. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that localized electrons on dangling oxygen drive the O&#8208;O dimerization. The covalence between the binding cation and the O&#8208;O dimer determines the degree of electron transfer in oxygen transformation. Dimerization induces irreversible structural distortion and slow kinetics. But peroxo formation can minimize the voltage drop and volume expansion in cumulative cationic and anionic redox. These findings offer insights into oxygen redox in the bulk for the rational design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Stimulation of Redox&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer by Interligand Hydrogen Bonding in a Cobalt Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10415-10422, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strengthening of interligand hydrogen bonding triggers a redox&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer (RIET) upon oxidation of a CoIII complex with a neutral redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand, leading to metal reduction (CoIII&#8594;CoII) and two&#8208;electron oxidation of the bisguanidine ligand. In the absence of interligand hydrogen bonding, oxidation leads to a CoIII complex with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand.







Abstract
Octahedrally coordinated cobalt(II) complexes with a redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and acac co&#8208;ligands were synthesized and their redox chemistry analysed in detail. The N&#8722;H functions in a bisguanidine ligand with partially alkylated guanidino groups form N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds with the acac co&#8208;ligands, thereby massively influencing the redox chemistry. For all complexes, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centred, leading to CoIII complexes with neutral bisguanidine ligand units. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation is ligand&#8208;centred in the case of Co&#8211;bisguanidine complexes with fully alkylated guanidino groups, giving CoIII complexes with radical monocationic bisguanidine ligands. On the other hand, the hydrogen&#8208;bond strengthening upon oxidation of the Co&#8211;bisguanidine complex with partially alkylated guanidino groups initiates metal reduction (CoIII&#8594;CoII) and two&#8208;electron oxidation of the guanidine ligand, providing the first example for the stimulation of redox&#8208;induced electron transfer by interligand hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Janus Nanocages of Platinum&#8208;Group Metals and Their Use as Effective Dual&#8208;Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10384-10392, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus nanocages of platinum&#8208;group metals were fabricated with a uniform size and well&#8208;defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6&#8197;nm thick. When tested as dual&#8208;electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and spatial positions of the metal layer.







Abstract
Janus nanocages with distinctive platinum&#8208;group metals on the outer and inner surfaces can naturally catalyze at least two different reactions. Here we report a general method based on successive deposition and then selective etching for the facile synthesis of such nanocages. We have fabricated 11 different types of Janus nanocages characterized by a uniform size and well&#8208;defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6&#8197;nm thick. When tested as dual&#8208;electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and relative position of the metal layer. Density functional theory studies suggest that the alloy composition and surface structure of the nanocages both play important roles in enhancing the electrocatalytic activities by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Gated Photochemical Synthesis of Phenalene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10402-10408, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylisophthalaldehydes form two highly reactive ortho&#8208;quinodimethane dienophiles in a step&#8208;wise and wavelength gated fashion. Trapping with maleimides proceeds with high stereoselectivity under the formation of phenalene diimide scaffolds. Subsequent elimination and oxidation affords a new class of persistent phenalenyl diimide neutral radicals.







Abstract
Herein, we pioneer a wavelength&#8208;gated synthesis route to phenalene diimides. Consecutive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of methylisophthalaldehydes and maleimides afford hexahydro&#8208;phenalene&#8208;1,6&#8208;diol diimides via 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;benzo[f]isoindoles as the intermediate. Both photoreactions are efficient (82&#8211;99&#8201;% yield) and exhibit excellent diastereoselectivity (62&#8211;98&#8201;%&#8197;d.r.). The wavelength&#8208;gated nature of the stepwise reaction enables the modular construction of phenalene diimide scaffolds by choice of substrate and wavelength. Importantly, this synthetic methodology opens a facile avenue to a new class of persistent phenalenyl diimide neutral radicals, constituting a versatile route to spin&#8208;active molecules.

         <title>Precise Pore Space Partitions Combined with High&#8208;Density Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Acceptors within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10122-10128, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benchmark metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents for C2H2/CO2 separation are reported. The MOFs offer moderate pore size distributions, which are regulated by precise pore space partitions and coupled with a high&#8208;density of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptors.







Abstract
The high storage capacity versus high selectivity trade&#8208;off barrier presents a daunting challenge to practical application as an acetylene (C2H2) adsorbent. A structure&#8211;performance relationship screening for sixty&#8208;two high&#8208;performance metal&#8211;organic framework adsorbents reveals that a moderate pore size distribution around 5.0&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; is critical to fulfill this task. A precise pore space partition approach was involved to partition 1D hexagonal channels of typical MIL&#8208;88 architecture into finite segments with pore sizes varying from 4.5&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;26) to 6.4&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;27), 7.1&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;28), and 8.1&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;29). Coupled with bare tetrazole N sites (6 or 12 bare N sites within one cage) as high&#8208;density H&#8208;bonding acceptors for C2H2, the target MOFs offer a good combination of high C2H2/CO2 adsorption selectivity and high C2H2 uptake capacity in addition to good stability. The optimized SNNU&#8208;27&#8208;Fe material demonstrates a C2H2 uptake of 182.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extraordinary C2H2/CO2 dynamic breakthrough time up to 91&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 under ambient conditions.

         <title>Delayed Linker Addition (DLA) Synthesis for Hybrid SOD ZIFs with&#8201;Unsubstituted Imidazolate Linkers for Propylene/Propane and n&#8208;Butane/i&#8208;Butane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10103-10111, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;pot synthesis, termed delayed linker addition (DLA), was developed to form hybrid ZIFs consisting of unsubstituted imidazolate and 2&#8208;methylimidazolate linkers with SOD topology. The easily obtained nuclei of ZIF&#8208;8 were utilized as a template to guide the structure of the crystals and to reduce the high energy required to form hybrid ZIFs.







Abstract
We present a novel synthesis strategy termed delayed linker addition (DLA) to synthesize hybrid zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks containing unsubstituted imidazolate linkers (Im) with SOD topology (hereafter termed Im/ZIF&#8208;8). Im linker incorporation can create larger voids and apertures, which are important properties for gas storage and separation. To date, there have been only a handful of reports of Im linkers incorporated into ZIF&#8208;8 frameworks, typically requiring arduous and complicated post synthesis approaches. DLA, as reported here, is a simple one&#8208;step synthesis strategy allowing high incorporation of Im linker into the ZIF&#8208;8 framework while still retaining its SOD topology. We fabricated mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) with 6FDA&#8208;DAM polymer and Im/ZIF&#8208;8 obtained via DLA as a filler. The Im/ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;containing MMMs showed excellent performance for both propylene/propane and n&#8208;butane/i&#8208;butane separation, displaying permeability and ideal selectivity well above the polymer upper bound. Moreover, highly detailed molecular simulations shed light to the aperture size and flexibility response of Im/ZIF&#8208;8 and its improved diffusivity as compared to ZIF&#8208;8.

         <title>Construction of Inorganic Crown Ethers by s&#8208;Block&#8208;Metal&#8208;Templated Si&#8722;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10393-10401, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;silicon versions of crown ethers were isolated and characterized. These silicon&#8208;based macrocycles are obtained from 2D2/s&#8208;block metaliodide/gallium(III)&#8208;iodide (2D2=(Me4Si2O)2) Lewis&#8208;acid systems which enable s&#8208;block metal templated Si&#8722;O bond activation and subsequent oligomerization. The coordination ability of these macrocycles is evaluated and a mechanism of formation is suggested by means of DFT calculations.







Abstract
We herein report the synthesis, structures, coordination ability, and mechanism of formation of silicon analogs of crown ethers. An oligomerization of 2D2 (I) (2Dn,=(Me4Si2O)n) was achieved by the reaction with GaI3 and MIx (M=Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr). In these reactions the metal cations serve as template and the anions (I&#8722;/[GaI4]&#8722;) are required as nucleophiles. In case of MIx=LiI, [Li(2D3)GaI4] (1) is formed. In case of MIx=NaI, MgI2, CaI2, and SrI2 the compounds [M(2D4)(GaI4)x] (M=Mg2+ (3), Ca2+ (4), Sr2+ (5) are obtained. Furthermore the proton complex [H(2D3)][Ga2I7] (6) was isolated and structurally characterized. All complexes were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, DOSY experiments and, except for compound 3, also by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum chemical calculations were carried out to compare the affinity of M+ to 2Dn and other ligands and to shed light on the formation of larger rings from smaller ones.

         <title>Thermal and pH Stabilities of i&#8208;DNA: Confronting in vitro Experiments with Models and In&#8208;Cell NMR Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10286-10294, April 26, 2021. </description>

i&#8208;DNA is an emerging non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure as an anticancer target and as a basic element in the programmable bionanotechnology. A large number of i&#8208;DNA&#8208;prone sequences were tested to disclose how primary sequences determine the i&#8208;DNA stability both in vitro and in cells.







Abstract
Recent studies indicate that i&#8208;DNA, a four&#8208;stranded cytosine&#8208;rich DNA also known as the i&#8208;motif, is actually formed in vivo; however, a systematic study on sequence effects on stability has been missing. Herein, an unprecedented number of different sequences (271) bearing four runs of 3&#8211;6 cytosines with different spacer lengths has been tested. While i&#8208;DNA stability is nearly independent on total spacer length, the central spacer plays a special role on stability. Stability also depends on the length of the C&#8208;tracts at both acidic and neutral pHs. This study provides a global picture on i&#8208;DNA stability thanks to the large size of the introduced data set; it reveals unexpected features and allows to conclude that determinants of i&#8208;DNA stability do not mirror those of G&#8208;quadruplexes. Our results illustrate the structural roles of loops and C&#8208;tracts on i&#8208;DNA stability, confirm its formation in cells, and allow establishing rules to predict its stability.

Our results illustrate the structural roles of loops and C&#8208;tracts on i&#8208;DNA stability, confirm its formation in cells, and allow establishing rules to predict its stability.&lt;/p&gt;

Cyclodextrin&#8208;triggered stiffening: A sidechain polypseudorotaxane&#8208;based sea cucumber mimic was designed from molecular entities, which exhibited multi&#8208;stage shape persistence and stiffness variations.







Abstract
The development of integrated systems that mimic the multi&#8208;stage stiffness change of marine animals such as the sea cucumber requires the design of molecularly tailored structures. Herein, we used an integrated biomimicry design to fabricate a sea cucumber mimic using sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with tunable nano&#8208;to&#8208;macroscale properties. A series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;based sidechain copolymers were synthesized to form sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs). By tailoring the copolymers&#8217; molecular weights and their PEG grafting densities, we rationally tuned the sizes of the formed polypseudorotaxanes crystalline domain and the physical crosslinking density of the hydrogels, which facilitated 3D printing and the mechanical adaptability to these hydrogels. After 3D printing and photo&#8208;crosslinking, the obtained hydrogels exhibited large tensile strain and broad elastic&#8208;to&#8208;plastic variations upon &#945;&#8208;CD (de)threading. These discoveries enabled a successful fabrication of a sea cucumber mimic, demonstrating multi&#8208;stage stiffness changes.

         <title>Stepped Channels Integrated Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Separator via Photoinduced Multidimensional Fabrication of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10147-10154, April 26, 2021. </description>

A two&#8208;step photoinduced heat&#8208;assisted processing (PHAP) method is proposed to fabricate a kind of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based triple&#8208;layer membrane with stepped channels. The membrane can be applied as a high performance separator in a lithium&#8211;sulfur battery.







Abstract
Multidimensional fabrication of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into multilevel channel integrated devices are in high demanded for Li&#8208;S separators. Such separators have advantages in pore&#8208;engineering that might fulfill requirements such as intercepting the diffusing polysulfides and improving the Li+/electrolyte transfer in Li&#8208;S batteries. However, most reported works focus on the roles of MOFs as ionic sieves for polysulfides while offering limited investigation on the tuning of Li+ transfer across the separators. A photoinduced heat&#8208;assisted processing strategy is proposed to fabricate MOFs into multidimensional devices (e.g., hollow/Janus fibers, double&#8208;or triple&#8208;layer membranes). For the first time, a triple&#8208;layer separator with stepped&#8208;channels has been designed and demonstrated as a powerful separator with outstanding specific capacity (1365.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and cycling performance (0.03&#8201;% fading per cycle from 100th to 700th cycle), which is superior to single/double&#8208;layer and commercial separators. The findings may expedite the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes and extend the scope of MOFs in energy&#8208;storage technologies.

         <title>Hydrolysis of Aliphatic Bis&#8208;isonitriles in the Presence of a Polar Super Aryl&#8208;Extended Calix[4]pyrrole Container</title>

A super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole acts as both a sequestering and supramolecular protecting group, enhancing the selectivity for the mono&#8208;formamide product in the hydrolysis of aliphatic bis&#8208;isonitriles.







Abstract
We report binding studies of an octa&#8208;pyridinium super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor with neutral difunctional aliphatic guests in water. The guests have terminal isonitrile and formamide groups, and the complexes display an inclusion binding geometry and 1:1 stoichiometry. Using 1H&#8197;NMR titrations and ITC experiments, we characterized the dissimilar thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the complexes. The bis&#8208;isonitriles possess independent reacting groups, however, in the presence of 1&#8197;equiv of the receptor the hydrolysis reaction produces mixtures of non&#8208;statistical composition and a significant decrease in reaction rates. The selectivity for the mono&#8208;formamide product is specially enhanced in the case of the bis&#8208;isonitrile having a spacer with five methylene groups. The analysis of the kinetic data suggests that the observed modifications in reaction rates and selectivity are related to the formation of highly stable inclusion complexes in which the isonitrile is hidden from bulk water molecules. The concentration of the reacting substrates in the bulk solution is substantially reduced by binding to the receptor. In turn, the hydrolysis rates of the isonitrile groups for the bound substrates are slower than in the bulk solution. The receptor acts as both a sequestering and supramolecular protecting group.

A simple way toward quinoidal helicences! A series of fused quinoidal dithiophene&#8208;based double and triple helicenes were synthesized by a new intramolecular radical&#8211;radical coupling reaction. Dynamic high performance liquid chromatography was used to quantitatively characterize the room&#8208;temperature racemization process between the enantiomers.







Abstract
A series of fused quinoidal dithiophene&#8208;based double and triple helicenes (1&#8208;M, 2&#8208;M, 2&#8208;M&#8208;Cl, 3&#8208;M, 3&#8208;M&#8208;Cl) were synthesized by intramolecular radical&#8211;radical coupling followed by oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. These helical molecules show dynamic interconversion of enantiomers in solution as revealed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements, and the energy barriers are correlated to the substituents and topological structures. Notably, dynamic high performance liquid chromatography was used to quantitatively investigate the room&#8208;temperature racemization process between the (P,P,M)&#8208; and (P,M,M)&#8208; enantiomers of the triple helical 3&#8208;M&#8208;Cl, which gave an interconversion energy barrier in consistent with density functional theory calculations. Their optical and electrochemical properties are dependent on the fusion mode. Our studies provide both new synthetic strategy and new dynamic analytical method for helicenes with unique electronic structure.

         <title>Regio&#8208;Regular Polymer Acceptors Enabled by Determined Fluorination on End Groups for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with 15.2&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

A regio&#8208;regular polymer acceptor PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o with highly conjugated polymerization sites is synthesized, exhibiting red&#8208;shifted absorption and ordered inter&#8208;chain packing compared to its isomeric counterparts (PYF&#8208;T and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;m). When employed in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o&#8208;based devices yield a higher efficiency of 15.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Polymerization sites of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) play vital roles in determining device performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Different from our recent work about fluoro&#8208; and bromo&#8208; co&#8208;modified end group of IC&#8208;FBr (a mixture of IC&#8208;FBr1 and IC&#8208;FBr2), in this paper, we synthesized and purified two regiospecific fluoro&#8208; and bromo&#8208; substituted end groups (IC&#8208;FBr&#8208;o &amp; IC&#8208;FBr&#8208;m), which were then employed to construct two regio&#8208;regular polymer acceptors named PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;m, respectively. In comparison with its isomeric counterparts named PYF&#8208;T&#8208;m with different conjugated coupling sites, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o exhibits stronger and bathochromic absorption to achieve better photon harvesting. Meanwhile, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o adopts more ordered inter&#8208;chain packing and suitable phase separation after blending with the donor polymer PM6, which resulted in suppressed charge recombination and efficient charge transport. Strikingly, we observed a dramatic performance difference between the two isomeric polymer acceptors PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;m. While devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o can yield power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2&#8201;%, devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;m only show poor efficiencies of 1.4&#8201;%. This work demonstrates the success of configuration&#8208;unique fluorinated end groups in designing high&#8208;performance regular polymer acceptors, which provides guidelines towards developing all&#8208;PSCs with better efficiencies.

         <title>Tailoring Electronic Structure and Size of Ultrastable Metalated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Electroconductivity for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10228-10238, April 26, 2021. </description>

An elaborately designed 3D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) integrating excellent chemical stability and good conductivity was obtained through a combination of ligand delocalization, activation energy, and morphology parameters. The superiority of the as&#8208;prepared pristine MOF&#8208;based supercapacitor electrode was structurally and electrochemically identified in detail.







Abstract
Utilization of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrodes for energy storage/conversion is challenging because of the low chemical stability and poor electrical conductivity of MOFs in electrolytes. A nanoscale MOF, Co0.24Ni0.76&#8208;bpa&#8208;200, possessing ultrahigh stability with uncommon semiconductor behavior (&#963;=4.2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1) was fabricated. The MOF comprises a robust hydrophobic paddlewheel and an optimized Co/Ni ratio, with consequent control over MOF size and the degree of conjugation of the coligand. A DFT study revealed that appropriate Ni2+ doping reduces the activation energy of the system, thus providing a higher carrier concentration, and the strongly delocalized N&#8208;donor ligand notably increases the metal&#8211;ligand orbital overlap to achieve efficient charge migration, leading to continuous through&#8208;bond (&#8208;CoNi&#8208;N&#8208;CoNi&#8208;)&#8734; conduction paths. These structural features endow the MOF with a good cycling stability of 86.5&#8201;% (10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles) and a high specific capacitance of 1927.14&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 among pristine MOF&#8208;based electrodes.

         <title>Characterization of a Molecule Partially Confined at the Pore Mouth of a Zeotype</title>

         <dc:description>
The interaction between a molecule and a pore mouth is investigated by grafting a supramolecular complex at the precise interface of microporous cavities and the external surface of a zeotype and characterizing its structure. The results reveal that partial confinement of a molecule within a micropore controls its conformation, providing a relevant model to understanding adsorption into micropores.







Abstract
We investigate the interaction between a molecule and a pore mouth&#8212;a critical step in adsorption processes&#8212;by characterizing the conformation of a macrocyclic calix[4]arene&#8208;TiIV complex, which is grafted on the external surface of a zeotype (*&#8208;SVY). X&#8208;ray absorption and 13C{1H} CPMAS NMR spectroscopies independently detect a unique conformation of this complex when it is grafted at crystallographically equivalent locations that lie at the interface of 7&#8197;&#197; hemispherical microporous cavities and the external surface. Electronic structure calculations support the presence of this unique conformation, and suggest that it is brought about by a specific orientation of the macrocycle that maximizes non&#8208;covalent interactions between calix[4]arene upper&#8208;rim tert&#8208;butyl substituents and the microporous&#8208;cavity walls. Our comparative study provides a rare &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of a molecule partially confined at a pore mouth, an essential intermediate for adsorption into micropores, and demonstrates how surrounding environment controls this confinement in a sensitive fashion.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission toward Harvesting Cold White Light from Warm White Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10082-10088, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) behavior of undoped two&#8208;dimensional perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2PbCl4 ((PEA)2PbCl4) nanocrystals was studied. An intriguing 5 times PIE phenomenon was achieved at a mild pressure of 0.4&#8197;GPa and, more importantly, the emission of cold white light, which is 1.6 times ambient photoluminescence intensity, can be successfully quenched by pressure treatment.







Abstract
The pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) behavior of halide perovskites has attracted widespread attention and has potential application in pressure sensing. However, high&#8208;pressure reversibility largely inhibits practical applications. Here, we describe the emission enhancement and non&#8208;doping control of the color temperature in two&#8208;dimensional perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2PbCl4 ((PEA)2PbCl4) nanocrystals (NCs) through high&#8208;pressure processing. A remarkable 5 times PIE was achieved at a mild pressure of 0.4&#8197;GPa, which was highly associated with the enhanced radiative recombination of self&#8208;trapped excitons. Of particular importance is the retention of the 1.6 times emission of dense (PEA)2PbCl4 NCs upon the complete release of pressure, accompanied by a color change from &#8220;warm&#8221; (4403&#8197;K) to &#8220;cold&#8221; white light with 14295&#8197;K. The irreversible pressure&#8208;induced structural amorphization, which facilitates the remaining local distortion of inorganic Pb&#8208;Cl octahedra with respect to the steric hindrance of organic PEA+ cations, should be greatly responsible for the quenched high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescence.

         <title>Single&#8208;Stranded DNA as Supramolecular Template for One&#8208;Dimensional Palladium(II) Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10089-10094, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional PdII array running through the center of the helixes have been prepared using a bottom&#8208;up approach by a self&#8208;assembly reaction between adenine homopolymers (dA) and complementary palladium complexes. The complexes bind to each adenine forming sequential Watson&#8211;Crick Pd&#8208;mediated base pairs.







Abstract
Atomic&#8208;level control over the position and growth of a single and continuous metal chain is an ambitious goal that often requires complex and costly processes. Herein, we demonstrate that 1Pd&#8208;DNA molecules, comprising a continuous single chain of PdII ions, can be prepared by a simple self&#8208;assembly reaction between the complex [Pd(Cheld)(CH3CN)] (1Pd_CH3CN) (Cheld=chelidamic acid) and single&#8208;stranded DNA homopolymers (ss&#8208;DNA) containing adenine (A) or 7&#8208;deazaadenine (X) bases. The single PdII&#8208;base pairs [1Pd(N1&#8208;A)] and [1Pd(N1&#8208;X)] were synthesized and characterized in solution and solid&#8208;state (X&#8208;ray diffraction) revealing an arrangement similar to that of natural Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. Subsequently, 1Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids were prepared, characterized, and their structures studied by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results indicate that the 1Pd&#8208;DNA structures resemble that of double&#8208;stranded DNA, with one strand being replaced by a supramolecular stack of continuous PdII complexes.

         <title>Targeting the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: From the Establishment of High Throughput Screening to the Design of Tailored Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10423-10429, April 26, 2021. </description>

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has been recognized as a significant drug target to treat COVID&#8208;19. The design of a new fluorogenic substrate, the recombinant expression of Mpro and the development of an HTS assay were combined with a structure&#8208;based rational approach leading to the discovery of tailored azanitriles and indole pyridyl esters as novel, outstandingly potent Mpro inhibitors.







Abstract
The main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro), the causative agent of COVID&#8208;19, constitutes a significant drug target. A new fluorogenic substrate was kinetically compared to an internally quenched fluorescent peptide and shown to be ideally suitable for high throughput screening with recombinantly expressed Mpro. Two classes of protease inhibitors, azanitriles and pyridyl esters, were identified, optimized and subjected to in&#8208;depth biochemical characterization. Tailored peptides equipped with the unique azanitrile warhead exhibited concomitant inhibition of Mpro and cathepsin&#8197;L, a protease relevant for viral cell entry. Pyridyl indole esters were analyzed by a positional scanning. Our focused approach towards Mpro inhibitors proved to be superior to virtual screening. With two irreversible inhibitors, azanitrile 8 (kinac/Ki=37&#8201;500&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Ki=24.0&#8197;nm) and pyridyl ester 17 (kinac/Ki=29&#8201;100&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Ki=10.0&#8197;nm), promising drug candidates for further development have been discovered.

         <title>Expanding the Structural Diversity of Protein Building Blocks with Noncanonical Amino Acids Biosynthesized from Aromatic Thiols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10040-10048, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nearly 50 novel noncanonical amino acids were efficiently biosynthesized in cells from simple aromatic thiol precursors and incorporated into proteins via genetic code expansion. Expression yields of proteins containing biosynthesized reactive amino acids were high, which allowed subsequent bioorthogonal chemical conjugation for both research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Incorporation of structurally novel noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins is valuable for both scientific and biomedical applications. To expand the structural diversity of available ncAAs and to reduce the burden of chemically synthesizing them, we have developed a general and simple biosynthetic method for genetically encoding novel ncAAs into recombinant proteins by feeding cells with economical commercially available or synthetically accessible aromatic thiols. We demonstrate that nearly 50 ncAAs with a diverse array of structures can be biosynthesized from these simple small&#8208;molecule precursors by hijacking the cysteine biosynthetic enzymes, and the resulting ncAAs can subsequently be incorporated into proteins via an expanded genetic code. Moreover, we demonstrate that bioorthogonal reactive groups such as aromatic azides and aromatic ketones can be incorporated into green fluorescent protein or a therapeutic antibody with high yields, allowing for subsequent chemical conjugation.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of Oxygen to Hydroxyl Radicals via 3&#8208;Electron Pathway with FeCo Alloy Encapsulated Carbon Aerogel for Fast and Complete Removing Pollutants</title>

Hydroxyl radicals are efficiently and continuously generated from selective electrochemical O2 reduction via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCoC electrode, overcoming the rate&#8208;limiting step of electron transfer initiated by reduction&#8208;/oxidation&#8208;state cycle. Fast and complete removal of organics with the apparent rate constant of 1.44&#177;0.04&#8197;min&#8722;1 represents high potential for practical water purification.







Abstract
We reported the selective electrochemical reduction of oxygen (O2) to hydroxyl radicals (.OH) via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCo alloy encapsulated by carbon aerogel (FeCoC). The graphite shell with exposed &#8208;COOH is conducive to the 2&#8208;electron reduction pathway for H2O2 generation stepped by 1&#8208;electron reduction towards to .OH. The electrocatalytic activity can be regulated by tuning the local electronic environment of carbon shell with the electrons coming from the inner FeCo alloy. The new strategy of .OH generation from electrocatalytic reduction O2 overcomes the rate&#8208;limiting step over electron transfer initiated by reduction&#8208;/oxidation&#8208;state cycle in Fenton process. Fast and complete removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 5&#8197;min in this proposed system, the apparent rate constant (kobs) was up to 1.44&#177;0.04&#8197;min&#8722;1, which is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advanced oxidation processes. The degradation rate almost remains the same after 50 successive runs, suggesting the satisfactory stability for practical applications.

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Binding DNA Aptamer that Inhibits Pseudovirus Infection by an RBD&#8208;Independent Mechanism**
</title>

SP6 is a DNA aptamer binding to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein and inhibits pseudovirus infection of cells. As the aptamer does not interfere with the CoV&#8208;2S ACE2 receptor binding domain, it provides an RBD&#8208;independent mechanism of virus inhibition.







Abstract
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (CoV2&#8208;S) binds to the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2&#8208;S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2&#8208;S and does not block the interaction of CoV2&#8208;S with ACE2. Nevertheless, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS&#8208;CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus, and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.

         <title>Polymer Stabilized Droplet Templating towards Tunable Hierarchical Porosity in Single Crystalline Na3V2(PO4)3 for Enhanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10334-10341, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile polymer stabilized droplet template strategy allows the synthesis of porous single crystal structured NVP with tunable pore structure. The resultant hierarchically meso/macropores NVP demonstrates superior sodium storage performances, because its porous single crystal structure shortens ion diffusion distance and provides large electrode&#8211;electrolyte contact area, greatly facilitating fast ionic transport.







Abstract
Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, whereas, its performance is usually limited by inherent low electronic conductivity and dense bulk structure. Herein, we develop a facile polymer stabilized droplet template strategy to synthesize porous single crystal structured NVP. The pore structures (macrostructures, hierarchically meso/macrostructures, and mesostructures), pore sizes (5&#8211;2000&#8197;nm), and specific surface areas (26&#8211;158&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) of the samples can be readily controlled by tuning the sizes of droplet templates. The resultant hierarchically meso/macropores NVP demonstrates superior sodium storage performances, because its porous single crystal structure owns solid&#8211;liquid Na+ transmission mode, shortens ion diffusion distance and provides large electrode&#8211;electrolyte contact area, greatly facilitating fast ionic transport. We believe the presented method will supply a novel avenue to prepare porous single crystal structured materials for anticipative applications.

         <title>Spatio&#8208;Chemical Heterogeneity of Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystals Revealed by Full&#8208;Field Tomographic X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional view of chemical heterogeneities in defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystals is presented. Cryo&#8208;full&#8208;field XANES computed tomography was used to visualize the presence and distribution of a second coordination polymer of reduced copper coordination within defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1 crystals. Observations encourage a revisitation of the structure&#8208;property relationships of defect&#8208;engineered MOFs.







Abstract
The introduction of structural defects in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), often achieved through the fractional use of defective linkers, is emerging as a means to refine the properties of existing MOFs. These linkers, missing coordination fragments, create unsaturated framework nodes that may alter the properties of the MOF. A property&#8208;targeted utilization of this approach demands an understanding of the structure of the defect&#8208;engineered MOF. We demonstrate that full&#8208;field X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure computed tomography can help to improve our understanding. This was demonstrated by visualizing the chemical heterogeneity found in defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1 MOF crystals. A non&#8208;uniform incorporation and zonation of the defective linker was discovered, leading to the presence of clusters of a second coordination polymer within HKUST&#8208;1. The former is suggested to be responsible, in part, for altered MOF properties; thereby, advocating for a spatio&#8208;chemically resolved characterization of MOFs.

         <title>Promoting the Furan Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction to Access New Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts with Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>

The use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) leads to a streamlined synthetic access to donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) photoswitches through shortened reaction times and increased yields. This approach enables the diversification of DASA structures through the use of previously unreactive donor or acceptor groups, as well as simple access to DASA&#8211;polymer conjugates even when using electron&#8208;poor amine donors.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photoswitches with a variety of emerging applications in photoresponsive materials. Their two&#8208;step modular synthesis, centered on the nucleophilic ring opening of an activated furan, makes DASAs readily accessible. However, the use of less reactive donors or acceptors renders the process slow and low yielding, which has limited their development. We demonstrate here that 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) promotes the ring&#8208;opening reaction and stabilizes the open isomer, allowing greatly reduced reaction times and increased yields for known derivatives. In addition, it provides access to previously unattainable DASA&#8208;based photoswitches and DASA&#8211;polymer conjugates. The role of HFIP and the photochromic properties of a set of new DASAs is probed using a combination of 1H&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The use of sterically hindered, electron&#8208;poor amines enabled the dark equilibrium to be decoupled from closed&#8208;isomer half&#8208;lives for the first time.

         <title>The Protein Corona Leads to Deformation of Spherical Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10342-10349, April 26, 2021. </description>

A fructose&#8208;based block copolymer was self&#8208;assembled into four different micelles with various shell polymer densities. The most brush&#8208;like micelle was observed to have the highest amount of protein adsorption and the lowest cellular uptake. Small angle scattering revealed that the protein corona transformed the spherical micelles into spheroidal micelles and the nanoparticles used in the biological experiment were therefore non&#8208;spherical.







Abstract
The formation of a non&#8208;specific protein corona around nanoparticles (NPs) has been identified as one of the culprits for failed nanomedicine. The amount and type of adsorbed protein from the blood plasma are known to determine the fate of NPs and the accessibility of targeting ligands. Herein, we show that the adsorbed protein may not only enlarge the NPs and change their surface properties but also, in the case of soft NPs such as polymer micelles, lead to deformation. Poly(1&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl &#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;fructopyranose)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(methylmethacrylate) (P(1&#8208;O&#8208;MAFru)&#8208;b&#8208;PMMA) block co&#8208;polymers were self&#8208;assembled into NPs with a spherical core&#8211;shell morphology as determined by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Upon incubation with albumin, TEM, SANS, and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) revealed the adsorption of albumin and deformation of the NPs with a spheroid geometry. Removal of the protein led to the reversal of the morphology back to the spherical core&#8211;shell structure. Structural studies and cell studies of uptake of the NPs imply that the observed deformation may influence blood circulation time and cell uptake.

We develop heterostructured black phosphorus/metal&#8211;organic framework hybrids by P&#8208;O&#8208;Co covalent bonding based on a droplet microfluidic strategy. The resulting hybrids are further constructed by 3D printing method into all&#8208;integrated solid&#8208;state flexible supercapacitor, which presents high energy density and capacitance owing to well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;porosity, large ionic surface area, and high redox activity.







Abstract
We develop hetero&#8208;nanostructured black phosphorus/metal&#8208;organic framework hybrids formed by P&#8208;O&#8208;Co covalent bonding based on a designed droplet microfluidic strategy consisting of confined and ultrafast microdroplet reactions. The resulting hybrid exhibits large capacitance (1347&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) in KOH electrolytes due to its large specific&#8208;surface&#8208;area (632.47&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;porosity (0.38&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), and engineered electroactivity. Furthermore, the proposed 3D printing method allows to construct all&#8208;integrated solid&#8208;state supercapacitor, which maintains interconnected porous network, good interfacial adhesion, and robust flexibility for short&#8208;path diffusion and excessive accommodation of ions. Consequently, the fabricated flexible supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 109.8&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3, large capacitance of 506&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3, and good long&#8208;term stability of 12000 cycles.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in GeSe Leads to High Thermoelectric Performance</title>

The structural transformation of GeSe is associated with a change in nature of the chemical bonding from covalent bonding in pristine orthorhombic GeSe to metavalent bonding in rhombohedral (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x. Metavalent bonding and ferroelectric instability lead to high thermoelectric performance in the rhombohedral p&#8208;type polycrystalline (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x.







Abstract
Orthorhombic GeSe is a promising thermoelectric material. However, large band gap and strong covalent bonding result in a low thermoelectric figure of merit, zT&#8776;0.2. Here, we demonstrate a maximum zT&#8776;1.35 at 627&#8197;K in p&#8208;type polycrystalline rhombohedral (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1&#8201;, which is the highest value reported among GeSe based materials. The rhombohedral phase is stable in ambient conditions for x=0.8&#8211;0.29 in (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x&#8201;. The structural transformation accompanies change from covalent bonding in orthorhombic GeSe to metavalent bonding in rhombohedral (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x&#8201;. (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1 has closely lying primary and secondary valence bands (within 0.25&#8211;0.30&#8197;eV), which results in high power factor 12.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 627&#8197;K. It also exhibits intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (0.38&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 578&#8197;K). Theoretical phonon dispersion calculations reveal vicinity of a ferroelectric instability, with large anomalous Born effective charges and high optical dielectric constant, which, in concurrence with high effective coordination number, low band gap and moderate electrical conductivity, corroborate metavalent bonding in (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1. We confirmed the presence of low energy phonon modes and local ferroelectric domains using heat capacity measurement (3&#8211;30&#8197;K) and switching spectroscopy in piezoresponse force microscopy, respectively.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Polyfunctional Triarylmethanes and 1,1&#8208;Diarylalkanes by Sequential Cross&#8208;Coupling of Benzal Diacetates with Organozinc Reagents</title>

         <dc:description>
A sequential cross&#8208;coupling of benzal diacetates with organozinc reagents is achieved, delivering various functionalized triarylmethane and 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane derivatives. This practical method features readily accessible substrates, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and one&#8208;pot conditions, wide scope, scalability, and synthetic utility in the efficient synthesis of biologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A variety of functionalized triarylmethane and 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane derivatives were prepared via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot and two&#8208;step procedure, involving the reaction of various benzal diacetates with organozinc reagents. A sequential cross&#8208;coupling is enabled by changing the solvent from THF to toluene, and a two&#8208;step SN1&#8208;type mechanism was proposed and evidenced by experimental studies. The synthetic utility of the method is further demonstrated by the synthesis of several biologically relevant molecules, such as an anti&#8208;tuberculosis agent, an anti&#8208;breast cancer agent, a precursor of a sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, and a FLAP inhibitor.

         <title>Stereoselective and Stereospecific Triflate&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Schmidt Reaction: Ready Access to Alkaloid Skeletons**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantiomerically enriched azabicyclic compounds found in several important families of alkaloids can be prepared by a remarkably stereospecific and stereoselective intramolecular Schmidt reaction. The initial asymmetric alcohol center controls the whole process, leading to the formation of one out of up to four possible diastereoisomers with inversion of the configuration at the original asymmetric center.







Abstract
The stereoselectivity and stereospecificity of the triflate&#8208;mediated intramolecular Schmidt reaction of substituted 3&#8208;(1&#8208;azidocyclohexyl)propanol derivatives leading to octahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]azepine, the structural skeleton of several important families of alkaloids such as the Stemona alkaloids, has been examined. The reaction involves an initial intramolecular SN2 reaction between the azide moiety and the triflate affording an intermediate spirocyclic aminodiazonoium salt that undergoes the expected 1,2&#8208;shift/N2&#8208;elimination followed by hydride&#8208;mediated iminium salt reduction. Remarkably, chiral alcohols are converted to the azabicyclic derivative with no or limited racemization. The initial asymmetric alcohol center controls the diastereoselectivity of the whole process, leading to the formation of one out of the four possible diastereoisomers of disubstituted octahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]azepine. The origin of the stereoselectivity is rationalized based on theoretical calculations. The concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(cis)&#8208;3&#8208;propylindolizidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;(cis)&#8208;3&#8208;butyllehmizidine, two alkaloids found in the venom of workers of the ant Myrmicaria melanogaster, is reported.

         <title>Crystal Structures and Catalytic Mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Diaminohexanoate Dehydrogenase and Rational Engineering for Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10203-10210, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate binding and catalytic mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase, the only known member of the &#946;&#8208;amino acid dehydrogenase family, are shown to be quite different from those of its &#945;&#8208;counterparts. Subsequent rational engineering expanded the substrate scope without reducing the enantioselectivity, enabling efficient asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) have shown considerable potential as biocatalysts in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino acids. However, compared to the widely studied &#945;&#8208;AADHs, limited knowledge is available about &#946;&#8208;AADHs that enable the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we report the crystal structures of a l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase and its variants, the only known member of &#946;&#8208;AADH family. Crystal structure analysis, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies and quantum chemical calculations revealed the differences in the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism from &#945;&#8208;AADHs. A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity (by 110&#8211;800 times) toward various aliphatic &#946;&#8208;amino acids without an enantioselectivity trade&#8208;off. Two &#946;&#8208;amino acids were prepared by using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) and high isolated yields (86&#8211;87&#8201;%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5&#8208;DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of &#946;&#8208;AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Deciphering the Supramolecular Organization of Multiple Guests Inside a Microporous MOF to Understand their Release Profile</title>

The stepwise nanoconfinement of mixtures of guest molecules into the pores of a metal&#8208;organic framework is investigated by SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC XRD analyses to understand selective uptake and release at a molecular level. The remarkable site selectivity observed for the incoming guest molecules is crucial to determine the properties of the material and to finely control the release profile.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) give the opportunity of confining guest molecules into their pores even by a post&#8208;synthetic protocol. PUM168 is a Zn&#8208;based MOF characterized by microporous cavities that allows the encapsulation of a significant number of guest molecules. The pores engineered with different binding sites show a remarkable guest affinity towards a series of natural essential oils components, such as eugenol, thymol and carvacrol, relevant for environmental applications. Exploiting single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, it was possible to step&#8208;wisely monitor the rather complex three&#8208;components guest exchange process involving dimethylformamide (DMF, the pristine solvent) and binary mixtures of the flavoring agents. A picture of the structural evolution of the DMF&#8208;to&#8208;guest replacement occurring inside the MOF crystal was reached by a detailed single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal monitoring. The relation of the supramolecular arrangement in the pores with selective guests release was then investigated as a function of time and temperature by static headspace GC&#8208;MS analysis.

         <title>Activation of 2&#8208;Cyclohexenone by BF3 Coordination: Mechanistic Insights from Theory and Experiment</title>

The Lewis acid complex of 2&#8208;cyclohexenone and BF3 relaxes to the active triplet state after photoexcitation in less than a picosecond. This process can be followed by XMS&#8208;CASPT2 dynamics and transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Lewis acids have recently been recognized as catalysts enabling enantioselective photochemical transformations. Mechanistic studies on these systems are however rare, either due to their absorption at wavelengths shorter than 260&#8197;nm, or due to the limitations of theoretical dynamic studies for larger complexes. In this work, we overcome these challenges and employ sub&#8208;30&#8208;fs transient absorption in the UV, in combination with a highly accurate theoretical treatment on the XMS&#8208;CASPT2 level. We investigate 2&#8208;cyclohexenone and its complex to boron trifluoride and analyze the observed dynamics based on trajectory calculations including non&#8208;adiabatic coupling and intersystem crossing. This approach explains all ultrafast decay pathways observed in the complex. We show that the Lewis acid remains attached to the substrate in the triplet state, which in turn explains why chiral boron&#8208;based Lewis acids induce a high enantioselectivity in photocycloaddition reactions.

Anisotropic environments can drastically alter the spectroscopy and photochemistry of molecules. A large structural and spectroscopic dataset of closely&#8208;related protein variants is used to study how the anisotropic chromophore environment of a fluorescent protein determines its properties.







Abstract
Anisotropic environments can drastically alter the spectroscopy and photochemistry of molecules, leading to complex structure&#8208;function relationships. We examined this using fluorescent proteins as easy&#8208;to&#8208;modify model systems. Starting from a single scaffold, we have developed a range of 27 photochromic fluorescent proteins that cover a broad range of spectroscopic properties, including the determination of 43 crystal structures. Correlation and principal component analysis confirmed the complex relationship between structure and spectroscopy, but also allowed us to identify consistent trends and to relate these to the spatial organization. We find that changes in spectroscopic properties can come about through multiple underlying mechanisms, of which polarity, hydrogen bonding and presence of water molecules are key modulators. We anticipate that our findings and rich structure/spectroscopy dataset can open opportunities for the development and evaluation of new and existing protein engineering methods.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Evidence for the Promotional Effect of Acid Sites on the Diffusion of Alkenes through Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10016-10022, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the acid site density on the diffusivities of alkanes and alkenes through the 8&#8208;ring windows of SAPO&#8208;34 was probed using a complementary set of ab initio MD simulations and experimental techniques (PFG&#8208;NMR and TAP pulse&#8208;response measurements). The presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites was found to have a clear promotional effect on alkene diffusion but it does not influence alkane diffusion.







Abstract
The diffusion of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is of fundamental importance for many zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. Transport of small alkenes in the confined zeolite pores can become hindered, resulting in a significant impact on the ultimate product selectivity and separation. Herein, intracrystalline light olefin/paraffin diffusion through the 8&#8208;ring windows of zeolite SAPO&#8208;34 is characterized by a complementary set of first&#8208;principle molecular dynamics simulations, PFG&#8208;NMR experiments, and pulse&#8208;response temporal analysis of products measurements, yielding information at different length and time scales. Our results clearly show a promotional effect of the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites on the diffusion rate of ethene and propene, whereas transport of alkanes is found to be insensitive to the presence of acid sites. The enhanced diffusivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons is ascribed to the formation of favorable &#960;&#8211;H interactions with acid protons, as confirmed by IR spectroscopy measurements. The acid site distribution is proven to be an important design parameter for optimizing product distributions and separations.

         <title>Lipopolysaccharide from Gut&#8208;Associated Lymphoid&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Resident Alcaligenes faecalis: Complete Structure Determination and Chemical Synthesis of Its Lipid&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10023-10031, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8211;microbe chemical ecology study revealed an effective and safe immunomodulator from Alcaligenes faecalis resident in gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, Peyer's patches (see picture). The complete structures of both the lipooligosaccharide and the lipopolysaccharide from A.&#8197;faecalis were characterized. Furthermore, A.&#8197;faecalis lipid&#8197;A molecules were synthesized with varying degrees of acylation and found to be a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate.







Abstract
Alcaligenes faecalis is the predominant Gram&#8208;negative bacterium inhabiting gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, Peyer's patches. We previously reported that an A.&#8197;faecalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acted as a weak agonist for Toll&#8208;like receptor&#8197;4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor&#8208;2 (MD&#8208;2) receptor as well as a potent inducer of IgA without excessive inflammation, thus suggesting that A.&#8197;faecalis LPS might be used as a safe adjuvant. In this study, we characterized the structure of both the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and LPS from A.&#8197;faecalis. We synthesized three lipid&#8197;A molecules with different degrees of acylation by an efficient route involving the simultaneous introduction of 1&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphates. Hexaacylated A.&#8197;faecalis lipid&#8197;A showed moderate agonistic activity towards TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling and the ability to elicit a discrete interleukin&#8208;6 release in human cell lines and mice. It was thus found to be the active principle of the LOS/LPS and a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate.

         <title>Redox Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Microporous Polymers as Ultralong&#8208;Lived Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10164-10171, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated microporous polymer (AQ&#8208;CMP) featuring an interconnected octupole network is explored as efficient and ultra&#8208;robust anodes for rechargeable air batteries. Benefiting from high density of redox sites, favorable electron structures, highly cross&#8208;linked and porous character, the AQ&#8208;CMP anode is endowed with a close&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity and unprecedented cycling stability with &#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention after 60000 cycles.







Abstract
Herein, we explore a new redox donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated microporous polymer (AQ&#8208;CMP) by utilizing anthraquinone and benzene as linkers via C&#8208;C linkages and demonstrate the first use of CMP as ultralong&#8208;lived anodes for rechargeable air batteries. AQ&#8208;CMP features an interconnected octupole network, which affords not only favorable electronic structure for enhanced electron transport and n&#8208;doping activity compared to linear counterpart, but also high density of active sites for maximizing the formula&#8208;weight&#8208;based redox capability.

&lt;p&gt;A redox donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated microporous polymer (AQ&#8208;CMP) featuring an interconnected octupole network is explored as efficient and ultra&#8208;robust anodes for rechargeable air batteries. Benefiting from high density of redox sites, favorable electron structures, highly cross&#8208;linked and porous character, the AQ&#8208;CMP anode is endowed with a close&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity and unprecedented cycling stability with &#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention after 60000 cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we explore a new redox donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated microporous polymer (AQ&#8208;CMP) by utilizing anthraquinone and benzene as linkers via C&#8208;C linkages and demonstrate the first use of CMP as ultralong&#8208;lived anodes for rechargeable air batteries. AQ&#8208;CMP features an interconnected octupole network, which affords not only favorable electronic structure for enhanced electron transport and n&#8208;doping activity compared to linear counterpart, but also high density of active sites for maximizing the formula&#8208;weight&#8208;based redox capability. This coupled with highly cross&#8208;linked and porous structure endows AQ&#8208;CMP with a specific capacity of 202&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (96&#8201;% of theoretical capacity) at 2&#8197;Ag&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention over 60000 charge/discharge cycles. The assembled CMP&#8208;air full cell shows a stable and high capacity with full capacity recovery after only refreshing cathodes, while the decoupled electrolyte and cathode design boosts the discharge voltage and voltage efficiency to &#8776;1&#8197;V and 87.5&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sulfur in Amorphous Silica for an Advanced Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Battery</title>

Sulfur as an electrode is loaded into amorphous silica by a facile dipping method. In charge/discharge process, the complex pores of amorphous silica, acting as micro&#8208;containers and the formation of Na&#8208;O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle.







Abstract
The room&#8208;temperature (RT) Na/S battery is a promising energy storage system owing to suitable operating temperature, high theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, it has a poor cycle life and low reversible capacity. In this work, we report a long&#8208;life RT&#8208;Na/S battery with amorphous porous silica as a sulfur host. The sulfur is loaded into amorphous silica by a dipping method; the optimal sulfur loading is up to 73.48&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Molecular dynamics simulation and first&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the complex pores, acting as micro&#8208;containers and the formation of Na&#8208;O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle. This would give rise to effectively avoiding the loss of active sulfur, corresponding to a superior capacity and an excellent cyclability even at 10&#8197;A&#8201;gsulfur&#8722;1 (nearly 100&#8201;% coulomb efficiency and high reversible capacity of 955.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;gsulfur&#8722;1 after 1460&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Effects of Sequence and Base Composition on the CD and TDS Profiles of i&#8208;DNA</title>

i&#8208;DNA is an emerging non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure that represents a suitable target in anticancer therapy. A multivariate data analysis unveiled peculiar TDS and CD spectral regions that could be used for the structural determination of i&#8208;DNA&#8208;forming sequences.







Abstract
The i&#8208;motif DNA, also known as i&#8208;DNA, is a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure formed by cytosine&#8208;rich sequences, consisting of two intercalated parallel&#8208;stranded duplexes held together by hemi&#8208;protonated cytosine&#8211;cytosine+ (C:C+) base pairs. The growing interest in the i&#8208;DNA structure as a target in anticancer therapy increases the need for tools for a rapid and meaningful interpretation of the spectroscopic data of i&#8208;DNA samples. Herein, we analyzed the circular dichroism (CD) and thermal difference UV&#8208;absorbance spectra (TDS) of 255 DNA sequences by means of multivariate data analysis, aiming at unveiling peculiar spectral regions that could be used as diagnostic features during the analysis of i&#8208;DNA&#8208;forming sequences.

         <title>Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Virus Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10266-10272, April 26, 2021. </description>

We propose an aptamer blocking strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With the advantages of small size, rapid kinetics, high stability, sophisticated programmability and high security, our aptamers have great potential as prophylactic and therapeutic agents, which could greatly assist in the intervention of prevailing and emerging infectious diseases other than COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is threating global health. Inhibiting interaction of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein (SRBD) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid these limitations, we demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers&#8217; binding to the region on SRBD that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With aptamer selection against SRBD and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2&#8208;6 was identified and applied to prevent, compete with, and substitute ACE2 from binding to SRBD. CoV2&#8208;6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent aptamer CoV2&#8208;6C3 (cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 is stable in serum for more than 12&#8197;h and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14&#8197;days. Furthermore, cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 binds to SRBD with high affinity (Kd=0.13&#8197;nM) and blocks authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with an IC50 of 0.42&#8197;nM.

         <title>Neutralizing Aptamers Block S/RBD&#8208;ACE2 Interactions and Prevent Host Cell Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10273-10278, April 26, 2021. </description>

Synthetic ssDNA aptamers containing a conserved sequence motif that specifically targets the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike have the capacity to neutralize the virus and prevent host cell infection in vitro, suggesting a new therapeutic approach to treat COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike (S) protein plays a central role in mediating the first step of virus infection to cause disease: virus binding to angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on human host cells. Therefore, S/RBD is an ideal target for blocking and neutralization therapies to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19). Using a target&#8208;based selection approach, we developed oligonucleotide aptamers containing a conserved sequence motif that specifically targets S/RBD. Synthetic aptamers had high binding affinity for S/RBD&#8208;coated virus mimics (KD&#8776;7&#8197;nM) and also blocked interaction of S/RBD with ACE2 receptors (IC50&#8776;5&#8197;nM). Importantly, aptamers were able to neutralize S protein&#8208;expressing viral particles and prevent host cell infection, suggesting a promising COVID&#8208;19 therapy strategy.

Using a target&#8208;based selection approach, we developed oligonucleotide aptamers containing a conserved sequence motif that specifically targets S/RBD. Synthetic aptamers had high binding affinity for S/RBD&#8208;coated virus mimics (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;7&#8197;nM) and also blocked interaction of S/RBD with ACE2 receptors (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;5&#8197;nM). Importantly, aptamers were able to neutralize S protein&#8208;expressing viral particles and prevent host cell infection, suggesting a promising COVID&#8208;19 therapy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Upconverted Stimulated Emission by Up to Six&#8208;Photon Excitation from Highly Extended Spiro&#8208;Fused Ladder&#8208;Type Oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission have been demonstrated in spiro&#8208;fused ladder&#8208;type oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s through multiphoton absorption with an absorbed photon number up to six. The results demonstrate an effective molecular design strategy for exploring highly efficient MPA fluorophores for multiphoton optical applications.







Abstract
Frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission induced by multiphoton absorption (MPA) have attracted much interest. As compared with low&#8208;order MPA processes, the construction of high&#8208;order MPA processes is highly desirable and rather attractive, yet remains a formidable challenge due to its inherent low transition probability. We report the observation of the first experimental frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission by simultaneous six&#8208;photon excitation in an organic molecular system. The well&#8208;designed organic conjugated system based on cross&#8208;shaped spiro&#8208;fused ladder&#8208;type oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s (SpL&#8722;z, z=1&#8211;3) manifests reasonably high MPA cross&#8208;sections and brilliant luminescence emission simultaneously. The six&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section of SpL&#8208;3 with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation was evaluated as 8.67&#215;10&#8722;169&#8197;cm12&#8201;s5&#8201;photon&#8722;5. Exceptionally efficient 2&#8208; to 6&#8208;photon excited stimulated emission was achieved under near&#8208;infrared laser excitation.

         <title>Bright Long&#8208;Lived Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Chromium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10095-10102, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of chiral CrIII chromophores with dual circularly polarized emission within the NIR has been synthesized and characterized. The rational design of the ligand skeleton on chiral CrIII complexes improves the chiral resolution as well as the CPL brightness. These optimized chiral chromophores based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are promising candidates for the emerging chiral technologies.







Abstract
A series of highly emissive inert and chiral CrIII complexes displaying dual circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) within the NIR region have been prepared and characterized. The helical [Cr(dqpR)2]3+ (dqp=2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)pyridine; R=OCH3, Br or C&#8801;CH) complexes were synthesized as racemic mixtures and resolved into their respective PP and MM enantiomers by chiral stationary phase HPLC. The corresponding enantiomers show large glum&#8776;0.2 and high quantum yield of up to 17&#8201;%, which afford important CPL brightness of up to 170&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, a key point for applications as chiral luminescent probes. Moreover, the long&#8208;lived CP&#8208;NIR emission provided by these chromophores (ms range) in aqueous solution opens the way toward the quantification of chiral targets in biological systems with time&#8208;gated detection. Thus, such chiral chromophores based on earth abundant and inert 3d metals open new perspectives in the field of CPL and represent an alternative to precious 4d, 5d and to labile 4f metal&#8208;based complexes.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Pairing Interactions in a Molecular Switch Evidenced by Ion Mobility Spectrometry and Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>

Gas&#8208;phase non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer is used for charge reduction of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer (green). The consecutive co&#8208;conformational transition is monitored using ion mobility spectrometry and infrared ion spectroscopy. Comparing the collision cross section distributions (blue) and infrared spectra (red) recorded for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical systems highlights differences that can be attributed to radical&#8208;pairing interactions.







Abstract
The digital revolution sets a milestone in the progressive miniaturization of working devices and in the underlying advent of molecular machines. Foldamers involving mechanically entangled components with modular secondary structures are among the most promising designs for molecular switch&#8208;based applications. Characterizing the nature and dynamics of their intramolecular network following the application of a stimulus is the key to their performance. Here, we use non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer as a reductive stimulus in the gas phase and probe the consecutive co&#8208;conformational transitions of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer using electrospray mass spectrometry interfaced with ion mobility and infrared ion spectroscopy. A comparison of collision cross section distributions for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical molecular ions sheds light on their respective formation energetics, while variations in their respective infrared absorption bands evidence changes in intramolecular organization as the foldamer becomes more compact. These differences are compatible with the advent of radical&#8208;pairing interactions.

         <title>Development of Generic G Protein Peptidomimetics Able to Stabilize Active State Gs Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors for Application in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10247-10254, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the crystal structure of the &#946;2AR coupled to the Gs protein, a helical key epitope was chosen as a template to design peptidomimetics able to stabilize active&#8208;state Gs protein&#8208;coupled receptors. Radioligand assays were performed in the presence of the peptide mimetics and demonstrated the stabilization of Gs receptors in active conformation, opening a gateway for fragment&#8208;based, agonist&#8208;earmarked drug discovery programs.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent an important group of membrane proteins that play a central role in modern medicine. Unfortunately, conformational promiscuity hampers full therapeutic exploitation of GPCRs, since the largest population of the receptor will adopt a basal conformation, which subsequently challenges screens for agonist drug discovery programs. Herein, we describe a set of peptidomimetics able to mimic the ability of G proteins in stabilizing the active state of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR) and the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R). During fragment&#8208;based screening efforts, these (un)constrained peptide analogues of the &#945;5 helix in Gs proteins, were able to identify agonism pre&#8208;imprinted fragments for the examined GPCRs, and as such, they behave as a generic tool, enabling an engagement in agonist earmarked discovery programs.

         <title>Synthesis of Zigzag Carbon Nanobelts through Scholl Reactions</title>

Regioselective Scholl reactions have enabled successful synthesis of unprecedented zigzag carbon nanobelts, which present a wave&#8208;like arrangement of hexagons in the unrolled lattice of (n,0) single wall carbon nanotubes (n=16 or 24). As monitored with fluorescence spectroscopy, one of these nanobelts binds C60 with an association constant as high as (6.6&#177;1.1)&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 in toluene.







Abstract
Zigzag carbon nanobelts are a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after target for organic synthesis. Herein we report new strategies for designing and synthesizing unprecedented zigzag carbon nanobelts, which present a wave&#8208;like arrangement of hexagons in the unrolled lattice of (n,0) single wall carbon nanotubes (n=16 or 24). The precursors of these zigzag carbon nanobelts are hybrid cyclic arylene oligomers consisting of meta&#8208;phenylene and 2,6&#8208;naphthalenylene as well as para&#8208;phenylene units. The Scholl reactions of these cyclic arylene oligomers form multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds selectively at the &#945;&#8208;positions of naphthalene units resulting in the corresponding zigzag carbon nanobelts. As monitored with fluorescence spectroscopy, one of these nanobelts binds C60 with an association constant as high as (6.6&#177;1.1)&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 in the solution in toluene. Computational studies combining linear regression analysis and hypothetical homodesmotic reactions reveal that these zigzag nanobelts have strain in the range of 67.5 to 69.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and the ladderization step through Scholl reactions is accompanied by increase of strain as large as 69.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The successful synthesis of these nanobelts demonstrates the powerfulness and efficiency of Scholl reactions in synthesizing strained polycyclic aromatics.

         <title>A Rod&#8208;Packing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Suitable Pore Confinement for Benchmark Ethane/Ethylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10304-10310, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rod&#8208;packing microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonding framework with functional surfaces and suitable cavity spaces for C2H6 uptake exhibited simultaneously high capacity and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (see picture). The excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation occurred with record&#8208;high C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 under high humidity and ambient conditions.







Abstract
For the separation of ethane from ethylene, it remains challenging to target both high C2H6 adsorption and selectivity in a C2H6&#8208;selective material. Herein, we report a reversible solid&#8208;state transformation in a labile hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework to generate a new rod&#8208;packing desolvated framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1) with suitable cavity spaces and functional surfaces to optimally interact with C2H6. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1 thus exhibits simultaneously high C2H6 uptake (88&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K) and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (2.25), which are significantly higher than those of most top&#8208;performing materials. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cage&#8208;like cavities and functional sites synergistically &#8220;match&#8221; better with C2H6 to provide stronger multipoint interactions with C2H6 than C2H4. In combination with its high stability and ultralow water uptake, this material can efficiently capture C2H6 from 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures in ambient conditions under 60&#8201;% RH, providing a record polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Complete Biosynthetic Pathway of Alazopeptin, a Tripeptide Consisting of Two Molecules of 6&#8208;Diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine and One Molecule of Alanine</title>

The complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide consisting of two molecules of DON (6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine) and one alanine, is revealed. The heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus was also established. Most interestingly, the transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates.







Abstract
DON (6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine), a diazo&#8208;containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60&#8197;years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala&#8208;DON&#8208;DON, which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr&#8208;93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Guidelines for Tuning the Excited State H&#252;ckel&#8211;Baird Hybrid Aromatic Character of Pro&#8208;Aromatic Quinoidal Compounds**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10255-10265, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To assist in the H&#252;ckel versus Baird tug&#8208;of&#8208;war over the control of the aromaticity in the central ring of pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds in their lowest&#8208;lying singlet and triplet excited states, which is mostly won by H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity, we identify several strategies that enhance the Baird&#8208;aromaticity of the central ring.







Abstract
Pro&#8208;aromatic molecules have higher&#8208;energy diradicaloid states that are significantly influenced by resonance structures in which conjugated rings take on H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic character. Recently, it has been argued that there are also pro&#8208;aromatic molecules that adopt central units with 4n&#960;&#8208;electron Baird&#8208;aromatic character in the T1 state, although detailed analysis suggests that these compounds are better labelled as T1 H&#252;ckel&#8211;Baird hybrid molecules where H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity dominates. Herein, we consider a series of symmetrically substituted conjugated rings with potential Baird aromaticity in the lowest excited triplet and singlet states. Our computational results allow us to establish general guidelines for the rational design of molecules with excited state H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity in pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds. We found two main strategies to promote high Baird aromatic character: 1)&#8197;anionic and small conjugated rings with electron donating groups as substituents and small exocyclic groups with electron withdrawing substituents, or 2)&#8197;electron deficient conjugated rings with exocyclic electron&#8211;donor substitution.

     alt="Guidelines for Tuning the Excited State H&#252;ckel&#8211;Baird Hybrid Aromatic Character of Pro&#8208;Aromatic Quinoidal Compounds**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist in the H&#252;ckel versus Baird tug&#8208;of&#8208;war over the control of the aromaticity in the central ring of pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds in their lowest&#8208;lying singlet and triplet excited states, which is mostly won by H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity, we identify several strategies that enhance the Baird&#8208;aromaticity of the central ring.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro&#8208;aromatic molecules have higher&#8208;energy diradicaloid states that are significantly influenced by resonance structures in which conjugated rings take on H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic character. Recently, it has been argued that there are also pro&#8208;aromatic molecules that adopt central units with 4&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#960;&#8208;electron Baird&#8208;aromatic character in the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state, although detailed analysis suggests that these compounds are better labelled as T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; H&#252;ckel&#8211;Baird hybrid molecules where H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity dominates. Herein, we consider a series of symmetrically substituted conjugated rings with potential Baird aromaticity in the lowest excited triplet and singlet states. Our computational results allow us to establish general guidelines for the rational design of molecules with excited state H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity in pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds. We found two main strategies to promote high Baird aromatic character: 1)&#8197;anionic and small conjugated rings with electron donating groups as substituents and small exocyclic groups with electron withdrawing substituents, or 2)&#8197;electron deficient conjugated rings with exocyclic electron&#8211;donor substitution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ligand Strain and Its Conformational Complexity Is a Major Factor in the Binding of Cyclic Dinucleotides to STING Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 10172-10178, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexity of the thermodynamics associated with the binding of fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated cyclic dinucleotides to the STING protein was analyzed and explained by employing a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Large enthalpy/entropy compensations can only be explained by complementing the structural and energetic analysis of the complex with conformational analysis of free ligands.







Abstract
STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a key regulator of innate immunity that has recently been recognized as a promising drug target. STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) which eventually leads to expression of type I interferons and other cytokines. Factors underlying the affinity of various CDN analogues are poorly understood. Herein, we correlate structural biology, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and computational modeling to elucidate factors contributing to binding of six CDNs&#8212;three pairs of natural (ribo) and fluorinated (2&#8242;&#8208;fluororibo) 3&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;CDNs. X&#8208;ray structural analyses of six {STING:CDN} complexes did not offer any explanation for the different affinities of the studied ligands. ITC showed entropy/enthalpy compensation up to 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for this set of similar ligands. The higher affinities of fluorinated analogues are explained with help of computational methods by smaller loss of entropy upon binding and by smaller strain (free) energy.

By means of a synergistic theoretical and experimental approach, Veronique Van&#8197;Speybroeck et&#8197;al. show in their Research Article on page&#8197;10016 that the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites promotes ethene diffusion through the cages of H&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34, whereas ethane diffusion remains invariant regarding the acid site density. The interaction of ethene with the acid sites (yellow dots) facilitates the diffusion through the catalyst, leading to a shorter diffusion path (blue pathway) compared to ethane, which follows a random trajectory (orange pathway).

Peroxo formation is the crucial step in oxygen redox. In their Research Article on page&#8197;10056, Bjoern Schwarz, Xiao&#8197;Cheng Zeng, Jun Li, and co&#8208;workers report on the reversible peroxo species formed and confined in high&#8208;capacity silicate cathodes. The picture shows the dominating binding mode of peroxo species, which forms in the delithiation amid high&#8208;voltage charging and reverses in the lithium re&#8208;intercalation during discharging. The reversible oxygen transformation following cationic redox is promising for high&#8208;energy, high&#8208;safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

An aptamer blocking strategy is developed by Honglin Chen, Yanling Song, Chaoyong Yang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;10266 to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. An aptamer probe was engineered to bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which inhibits infection with the virus by blocking the interaction of the virus with ACE2 receptors on the human cell membrane.

Martin Gouterman was an iconic figure of porphyrin science. Using his eponymous four&#8208;orbital model, he accomplished a grand optical taxonomy of porphyrin derivatives. He devoted the latter part of his career to devise pressure&#8208;sensitive paints, which are now widely used by the aerospace industry. A gay man, he helped set up Seattle's first gay rights group. In death, he remains a beacon for a more humane and inclusive scientific enterprise.







Abstract
Martin Gouterman (1931&#8211;2020) was one of the foundational figures of modern porphyrin science. After completing his Ph.D. at The University of Chicago in 1958, he joined Harvard, where he developed his eponymous four&#8208;orbital model. In 1966, he moved to the University of Washington Seattle (UW). Here he came out as gay and helped set up Seattle's first gay rights group, the Dorian Society. At UW, Gouterman accomplished an &#8220;optical taxonomy&#8221; of the major classes of porphyrin derivatives and pioneered pressure&#8208;sensitive paints based on phosphorescent platinum porphyrins to map the partial pressure of oxygen on airplane wings. Revered by his students and co&#8208;workers for his brilliant yet gentle advising, Gouterman remains a beacon for a more humane and inclusive scientific enterprise.

         <title>Tailoring Optical Properties of Luminescent Semiconducting Nanocrystals through Hydrostatic, Anisotropic Static, and Dynamic Pressures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9772-9788, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the pressure&#8208;dependence of the optical properties of all&#8208;inorganic and organolead perovskite, II&#8211;VI, III&#8211;V, and IV&#8211;VI semiconductor nanocrystals. Obtaining a better understanding of the optical behavior of semiconductors under pressure provides insight into the interplay of quantum confinement and mechanical effects.







Abstract
Luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals are a fascinating class of materials because of their size&#8208;dependent emissions. Numerous past studies have demonstrated that semiconductor nanoparticles with radii smaller than their Bohr radius experience quantum confinement and thus size&#8208;dependent emissions. Exerting pressure on these nanoparticles represents an additional, more dynamic, strategy to alter their size and shift their emission. The application of pressure results in the lattices becoming strained and the electronic structure altered. In this Minireview, colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are first introduced. The effects of uniform hydrostatic pressure on the optical properties of metal halide perovskite (ABX3), II&#8211;VI, III&#8211;V, and IV&#8211;VI semiconductor nanocrystals are then examined. The optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals under static and dynamic anisotropic pressure are then summarized. Finally, future research directions and applications utilizing the pressure&#8208;dependent optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals are discussed.

What are the modes of action of small&#8208;molecule drug candidates of major viral targets for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2? Key steps in the central machinery of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 life cycle are dissected in this Minireview to provide insights into the development of broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral therapeutics for fighting COVID&#8208;19 and potential future waves of the coronavirus pandemic.







Abstract
The mainstream approach to antiviral drugs against COVID&#8208;19 is to focus on key stages of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 life cycle. The vast majority of candidates under investigation are repurposed from agents of other indications. Understanding protein&#8211;inhibitor interactions at the molecular scale will provide crucial insights for drug discovery to stop this pandemic. In this article, we summarize and analyze the most recent structural data on several viral targets in the presence of promising inhibitors for COVID&#8208;19 in the context of the perspective of modes of action (MOA) to unravel insightful mechanistic features with atomistic resolution. The targets include spike glycoprotein and various host proteases mediating the entry of the virus into the cells, viral chymotrypsin&#8208; and papain&#8208;like proteases, and RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase. The main purpose of this review is to present detailed MOA analysis to inspire fresh ideas for both de novo drug design and optimization of known scaffolds to combat COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Oxidative&#8208;Species&#8208;Selective Materials for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9804-9827, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties and biological functions of oxidative species and oxidative&#8208;species&#8208;selective and &#8208;sensitive materials are summarized in this review, including their categorization, activities, reactive mechanisms, chemical structures, and biomedical applications. Particular attention is paid to the selectivity and sensitivity of different chemical linkers/groups to specific oxidative species and the underlying chemistry of their interactions.







Abstract
With the increasing recognition of the diverse roles and significance of oxidative species in the pathogenesis of many diseases, a tremendous amount of work on the development of oxidative&#8208;species&#8208;responsive materials has been conducted for 1)&#8197;detecting oxygen metabolites or diagnosis of oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;relevant diseases, 2)&#8197;reducing oxidative stress in the disease sites, and/or 3)&#8197;delivering therapeutic and diagnostic agents. In this review, we first discuss the distinct features and biological functions of each oxidative species. Then the selectivity and sensitivity of chemical linkers/groups to specific oxidative species and the underlying chemistry of their particular interactions are systematically elucidated. Their potential biomedical applications are also highlighted. We expect that this comprehensive review will provide more insights for the design and development of oxidative&#8208;species&#8208;selective materials for more effective diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Chemistry of Chitosan Aerogels: Three&#8208;Dimensional Pore Control for Tailored Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9828-9851, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chitosan aerogels and freeze&#8208;dried gels&#8212;these fascinating bio&#8208;derived materials, with tailored porous structures and otherwise inaccessible functionalities, recently emerged from the biomedical field into the realm of materials science and chemistry. Chitosan aerogels are a hot topic in academic research, but what are the barriers to industrial production and commercialization?







Abstract
Chitosan is an abundant biopolymer derived from food waste with attractive properties, particularly its high biocompatibility and easy chemical processability. Here, we review the rapidly expanding literature on chitosan&#8208;based porous materials with a focus on the gelation mechanisms, the three&#8208;dimensional multiscale structural control, and the diverse chemical functionality not accessible by other biopolymers. The properties vary widely: from supercritically dried, mesoporous chitosan aerogels to very light, freeze&#8208;dried macroporous scaffolds. Porous chitosan displays impressive performance at the laboratory scale, but the highly (meso)porous nature amplifies not only the beneficial functionality of chitosan, but also its drawbacks, resulting in serious barriers to industrialization. In order to facilitate technology transfer, we critically discuss the practical feasibility of chitosan aerogels in potential applications compared to conventional and other biopolymer&#8208;based porous or nonporous materials.

         <title>Direct Access to Primary Amines from Alkenes by Selective Metal&#8208;Free Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9875-9880, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and modular route to a wide variety of aliphatic primary amines from alkenes is presented based on a metal&#8208;free hydroamination at room temperature. The use of cost&#8208;effective and easily available ammonium carbonate allows for the efficient conversion of terminal and internal alkenes with diverse substitution patterns into highly functionalized linear, &#945;&#8208;branched, and &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines.







Abstract
Direct and selective synthesis of primary amines from easily available precursors is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the rapid synthesis of primary amines from alkenes via metal&#8208;free regioselective hydroamination at room temperature. Ammonium carbonate was used as ammonia surrogate for the first time, allowing for efficient conversion of terminal and internal alkenes into linear, &#945;&#8208;branched, and &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines under mild conditions. This method provides a straightforward and powerful approach to a wide spectrum of advanced, highly functionalized primary amines which are of particular interest in pharmaceutical chemistry and other areas.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Homochiral Radical Cage with Paramagnetic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9852-9858, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homochiral radical cage containing four spin centers was self&#8208;assembled in high yield by imine condensation in a one&#8208;pot manner, without purification. Intramolecular interactions such as [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] and hydrogen&#8208;bonding endow the cage with stable homochirality. Magnetic measurements demonstrated that the tetra&#8208;radical cage exhibits a typical spin&#8208;half paramagnetic behavior with a spin concentration of 3.58 spins/cage, indicating that each radical within a cage is weakly coupled.







Abstract
Condensation of an inherently C3&#8208;symmetric polychlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical trisaldehyde with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN) yields a [4+4] tetrahedral radical cage as a racemic pair of homochiral enantiomers in 75&#8201;% isolated yield. The structure was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the homochirality of each cage framework. The homochirality results from intramolecular [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the cage framework. The four PTM radicals in a cage undergo weak through&#8208;space coupling. Magnetic measurements demonstrated that each cage bears 3.58 spins.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Liquids Based on Siloxybinaphthyls: Best Binaphthyl Dihedral Angle in the Excited State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9968-9972, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) neat liquids based on siloxybinaphthyls were developed. The position of the substitution has a crucial effect on the CPL activity and liquefaction. In the excited state, the binaphthyls specifically adopt a transoid conformation with a dihedral angle of 121&#176;, which is close to the best binaphthyl dihedral angle for the high CPL activity.







Abstract
A series of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyls with trialkylsiloxy (OSiR3) groups were synthesized. Among them, 1&#8201;a&#8211;c possessing OSiR3 groups at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions and methyl groups at the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions were liquids at room temperature, and the neat liquids showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (R=Bu; &#934;fl,liquid=0.21, |glum,liquid|=1.6&#215;10&#8722;3). The |glum,liquid| value is the highest of pure liquids. These compounds remained liquid over a broad range of temperatures, down to &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations indicated that in the excited state, the binaphthyls adopt a transoid conformation with a small angle between the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments (&#952;&#956;,m=77&#176;), which is a key factor in their CPL activity. The best binaphthyl dihedral angle in the excited state is approximately 110&#176;.

         <title>Organosulfide&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9881-9885, April 26, 2021. </description>

A new class of deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by the Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction between 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is reported. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interaction triggers the deep eutectic phenomenon, thus liberating the Li+ from LiTFSI and endowing the DEE with promising ionic conductivity. The DEE exhibits nonflammable nature and was successfully applied in a Li/LiFePO4 half cell.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are a new class of electrolytes with unique properties. However, the intermolecular interactions of DEEs are mostly dominated by Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, limiting the diversity of chemical space and material constituents. Herein, we report a new class of DEEs induced by Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions between 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The strong ion&#8208;dipole interaction triggers the deep eutectic phenomenon, thus liberating the Li+ from LiTFSI and endowing the DEEs with promising ionic conductivity. These DEEs show admirable intrinsic safety, which cannot be ignited by flame. The DEE at the molar ratio of DpyDS:LiTFSI=4:1 (abbreviated as DEE&#8208;4:1) is electrochemically stable between 2.1 and 4.0&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+, and exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Li/LiFePO4 half cell with DEE&#8208;4:1 can provide a reversible capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and Coulombic efficiency above 98&#8201;% at 50&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Salinity Gradient Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9925-9930, April 26, 2021. </description>

Free&#8208;standing covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based membranes with excellent stability and mechanical properties were fabricated. The membranes have one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels for ion transport and they exhibit high conductivity and selectivity. The membranes demonstrated efficient salinity gradient energy conversion, which highlights the potential of covalent organic frameworks in energy harvesting.







Abstract
Both high ionic conductivity and selectivity of a membrane are required for efficient salinity gradient energy conversion. An efficient method to improve energy conversion is to align ionic transport along the membrane thickness to address low ionic conductivity in traditional membranes used for energy harvesting. We fabricated a free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework membrane (TpPa&#8208;SO3H) with excellent stability and mechanical properties. This membrane with one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels and high charge density demonstrated high ionic conductivity and selectivity. Its power density reached up to 5.9&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing artificial seawater and river water. Based on our results, we attribute the high energy conversion to the high ion conductivity through aligned one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels and high ion selectivity via the size of the nanochannel at &#8776;1&#8197;nm in the membrane. This study paves the way for designing covalent organic framework membranes for high salinity gradient energy conversion.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Coordinated Supramolecular Polymers from the Minimalistic Hybrid Peptide Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9863-9868, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;mediated supramolecular assembly of short helical peptides is investigated. Sequence specific selective metallogels with different metal ions, two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;coordinated helical polymers, and three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;helix porous frameworks are reported. Studies suggested that short hybrid helical peptides can be used to construct metal&#8208;mediated architectures.







Abstract
Availing the peptide folded architectures to design metal&#8208;coordinated frameworks and cages is restricted due to the scarcity of readily accessible short and stable secondary structures. The secondary structures, &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheets, play significant roles in stabilizing tertiary folds of proteins. Designing such helical structures from the short sequences of peptides without having any steric restrictions is exceptionally challenging. Here we reveal the short &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid tripeptide sequences that manifest stable helical structures without having any sterically constrained amino acids. These short hybrid tripeptides fold into helices even in the presence of two typically &#946;&#8208;sheet favoring Val residues.

&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8208;mediated supramolecular assembly of short helical peptides is investigated. Sequence specific selective metallogels with different metal ions, two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;coordinated helical polymers, and three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;helix porous frameworks are reported. Studies suggested that short hybrid helical peptides can be used to construct metal&#8208;mediated architectures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availing the peptide folded architectures to design metal&#8208;coordinated frameworks and cages is restricted due to the scarcity of readily accessible short and stable secondary structures. The secondary structures, &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheets, play significant roles in stabilizing tertiary folds of proteins. Designing such helical structures from the short sequences of peptides without having any steric restrictions is exceptionally challenging. Here we reveal the short &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid tripeptide sequences that manifest stable helical structures without having any sterically constrained amino acids. These short hybrid tripeptides fold into helices even in the presence of two typically &#946;&#8208;sheet favoring Val residues. The hybrid helix consisting of terminal pyridine units coordinates with the metal ions and drives the helical polymerization. Depending on the sequence and the position of N in pyridine moieties, these peptides form selective metallogels with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The X&#8208;ray diffracted analysis of the peptide single crystals obtained from the gel matrix reveals that the helical structure is maintained during the self&#8208;assembly process. Further, by varying the counter anion, a 3D helical crystalline coordination polymer with permanent porosity is generated. The findings reported here can be used to design new functional metal&#8208;foldamer coordinated polymers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Polyhedral Oligosilsesquioxanes in Functional Chiral Nanoassemblies</title>

Incorporating polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes into functional chiral nanoassemblies enables flexible control over chiroptical properties and supramolecular chirality. The chiral nanoassemblies were also used for instant information encryption and storage with multiple luminescent displays.







Abstract
Incorporation of giant molecular nanoparticles with atomic precision into chiral nanoassemblies facilitates the fabrication of functional ordered phases with supramolecular chirality, which remains mysterious. Reported here is the first example of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) derivatives that self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined chiral nanoassemblies. POSSs were covalently conjugated to N&#8208;terminal aromatic amino acids, which self&#8208;assembled into nanohelices and twists with explicit handedness tuned by solvent polarity. Chiral nanoassemblies showed active chiroptical responses including Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence. The chiral systems can bind guest molecules by charge&#8208;transfer interactions, whereby self&#8208;assembled structures, chiroptical activities, and luminescent colors were further modulated. The unique coassembly systems were applied for instant information encryption and storage with multiple luminescent displays. This work offers a new protocol for the design of functional chiral materials of POSS by molecular self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>The Competitive Aggregation Pathway of an Asymmetric Chiral Oligo(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene) Towards the Formation of Individual P and M Supramolecular Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9919-9924, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation of a short, chiral, and asymmetric oligo(phenyleneethynylene) [OPE, (S)&#8208;1] goes through a competitive pathway in which the two diastereomeric P and M supramolecular helices can be selectively produced by choosing the correct experimental conditions. Thus, while an M supramolecular aggregate is obtained in MCH/DCM [AggII], the diastereomeric P aggregate [AggI] is produced by adding toluene to the solvent mixture MCH/Tol/DCM.







Abstract
A complex aggregation pathway towards two diastereomeric P and M supramolecular helices arises from the aggregation of a short, chiral, and rigid oligo(phenyleneethynylene) [OPE, (S)&#8208;1]. Thus, while AggI aggregate is obtained when a DCM solution of (S)&#8208;1 is diluted with MCH at room temperature, AggII aggregate is generated only after a slow heating (353&#8197;K)/cooling (273&#8197;K) process. Interestingly, during AggI formation (mechanism 1), short P chain oligomers are produced, which have a great tendency to aggregate in plane, yielding brick&#8208;like nanostructures that halt the aggregation process. On the other hand, after a heating/cooling cycle, long M type columnar helical aggregates (AggII) are obtained, formed by individual supramolecular polymer chains (mechanism 2) easily visualized by AFM. The two different P/M orientations obtained for AggI and AggII reveal the dynamic character of the system and its ability to create diastereomeric helical structures under the right conditions. Different experimental protocols were explored to prepare long M type columnar helical aggregates, which are not obtained by using the previous MCH/DCM 99/1 (v/v) solvent mixture. The generation of the desired M oriented supramolecular polymer is achieved when toluene is added to the solvent mixture in a 97/2/1 MCH/Tol/DCM (v/v/v) ratio.

The intrinsic semiconducting properties of one of the largest mixed&#8208;valent uranium(V/VI) clusters are presented. It shows a large on&#8208;off ratio of 500 and considerable charge mobility lifetime product of 2.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1, as well as a high detection sensitivity of 23.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under X&#8208;ray excitation.







Abstract
We disclose the intrinsic semiconducting properties of one of the largest mixed&#8208;valent uranium clusters, [H3O+][UV(UVIO2)8(&#956;3&#8208;O)6(PhCOO)2(Py(CH2O)2)4(DMF)4] (Ph=phenyl, Py=pyridyl, DMF=N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide) (1). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrates that UV center is stabilized within a tetraoxo core surrounded by eight uranyl(VI) pentagonal bipyramidal centers. The oxidation states of uranium are substantiated by spectroscopic data and magnetic susceptibility measurement. Electronic spectroscopy and theory corroborate that UV species serve as electron donors and thus facilitate 1 being a n&#8208;type semiconductor. With the largest effective atomic number among all reported radiation&#8208;detection semiconductor materials, charge transport properties and photoconductivity were investigated under X&#8208;ray excitation for 1: a large on&#8208;off ratio of 500 and considerable charge mobility lifetime product of 2.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1, as well as a high detection sensitivity of 23.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

This limitation can be overcome by cell&#8208;based screening as employed in this study, which revealed novel chemotypes that potently inhibit IDO1 activity and kynurenine production by competing with heme.







Abstract
The immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO1) strengthens cancer immune escape, and inhibition of IDO1 by means of new chemotypes and mechanisms of action is considered a promising opportunity for IDO1 inhibitor discovery. IDO1 is a cofactor&#8208;binding, redox&#8208;sensitive protein, which calls for monitoring of IDO1 activity in its native cellular environment. We developed a new, robust fluorescence&#8208;based assay amenable to high throughput, which detects kynurenine in cells. Screening of a ca. 150&#8201;000&#8208;member compound library discovered unprecedented, potent IDO1 modulators with different mechanisms of action, including direct IDO1 inhibitors, regulators of IDO1 expression, and inhibitors of heme synthesis. Three IDO1&#8208;modulator chemotypes were identified that bind to apo&#8208;IDO1 and compete with the heme cofactor. Our new cell&#8208;based technology opens up novel opportunities for medicinal chemistry programs in immuno&#8208;oncology.

Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) have been obtained from distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon nodes. Interframework &#960;&#8208;stacking enables charge transport properties that are not expected for 3D COFs.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with a pcu topology have been obtained from distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons acting as triangular antiprismatic (D3d) nodes. Such 3D COFs are six&#8208;fold interpenetrated as the result of interframework &#960;&#8208;stacking, which enable charge transport properties that are not expected for 3D COFs.

         <title>MOF Nanosheet Reconstructed Two&#8208;Dimensional Bionic Nanochannel for Protonic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9931-9935, April 26, 2021. </description>

A MOF thin film&#8208;based bionic proton field&#8208;effect transistor (H+&#8208;FET) has been fabricated for the first time. It displays the highest proton mobility and highest on&#8211;off ratio among all reported H+&#8208;FETs.







Abstract
The construction of hydrophobic nanochannel with hydrophilic sites for bionic devices to proximally mimick real bio&#8208;system is still challenging. Taking the advantages of MOF chemistry, a highly oriented CuTCPP thin film has been successfully reconstructed with ultra&#8208;thin nanosheets to produce abundant two&#8208;dimensional interstitial hydrophobic nanochannels with hydrophilic sites. Different from the classical active&#8208;layer material with proton transport in bulk, CuTCPP thin film represents a new type of active&#8208;layer with proton transport in nanochannel for bionic proton field&#8208;effect transistor (H+&#8208;FETs). The resultant device can reversibly modulate the proton transport by varying the voltage on its gate electrode. Meanwhile, it shows the highest proton mobility of &#8776;9.5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and highest on&#8208;off ratio of 4.1 among all of the reported H+&#8208;FETs. Our result demonstrates a powerful material design strategy for proximally mimicking the structure and properties of bio&#8208;systems and constructing bionic electrical devices.

An inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer of [K(2,2,2&#8208;crypt)]4{[K2ZnSn8(ZnMes)]2} was synthesized. The highly charged [Sn8]6&#8722; is captured by mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII to form the closo&#8208;[Zn2Sn8] bridged by a ZnI&#8208;ZnI bond. The Zn&#8211;Sn compound not only indicates the [Sn8]6&#8722; can act as a novel bridging ligand like arene, but shows the interdisciplinary integration of cluster chemistry and zinc chemistry.







Abstract
Since [Sn8]6&#8722; was discovered from the solid&#8208;state phase in 2000, its solution chemistry has been elusive due to the high charges and chemical activity. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer {[K2ZnSn8(ZnMes)]2}4&#8722; (1&#8201;a), in which the highly charged [Sn8]6&#8722; is captured by mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII to form the dimer {closo&#8208;[Zn2Sn8]}2 moieties bridged by a Zn&#8208;Zn bond. Such Zn&#8208;Sn cluster not only exhibits a novel example of mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII for stabilizing highly active anion species, but also indicates the [Sn8]6&#8722; cluster can act as a novel bridging ligand, like arene, with a &#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;fashion. Theoretical calculations indicate that a significant delocalization of electrons over Zn atoms plays a vital role in the stabilization of the [Sn8]6&#8722; species. The AdNDP and magnetic response analyses clearly showed the presence of local &#963;&#8208;aromaticity in three cluster fragments: two ZnSn4 caps and Sn8 square antiprism.

         <title>Programming Gels Over a Wide pH Range Using Multicomponent Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9973-9977, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that a multicomponent supramolecular gel with two opposite ionizable pendant groups on different components can exhibit unusual phase behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows the preparation of gels with improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
Multicomponent hydrogels offer a tremendous opportunity for preparing useful and exciting materials that cannot be accessed using a single component. Here, we describe an unusual multi&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular weight gelling system that exhibits pH&#8208;responsive behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Unlike traditional acid&#8208;triggered gels, our system undergoes a change in the underlying molecular packing and maintains the &#946;&#8208;sheet structure both at acidic and basic pH.

     alt="Programming Gels Over a Wide pH Range Using Multicomponent Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that a multicomponent supramolecular gel with two opposite ionizable pendant groups on different components can exhibit unusual phase behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows the preparation of gels with improved mechanical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicomponent hydrogels offer a tremendous opportunity for preparing useful and exciting materials that cannot be accessed using a single component. Here, we describe an unusual multi&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular weight gelling system that exhibits pH&#8208;responsive behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Unlike traditional acid&#8208;triggered gels, our system undergoes a change in the underlying molecular packing and maintains the &#946;&#8208;sheet structure both at acidic and basic pH. We further establish that autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows us to prepare gels with improved mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Crown Ether Struts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9959-9963, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown ethers, serving as supramolecular hosts, have been widely used as building blocks to construct different functional polymers. Covalent organic frameworks constructed with crown ether skeletons have been demonstrated, which display high surface areas and crystallinity. This strategy offers a general guidance for designing crown ethers based covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
Crown ethers are a class of macrocyclic molecules with unique flexible structures but they are rarely integrated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). To date, employing flexible organic units such as crown ethers to construct COFs with high crystallinity and surface area are still a challenge. In this work, two new COFs with different flexible crown ethers as backbone rather than side chains are synthesized and further employed for alkali metal ions separation. Both of COFs possess high surface areas, good crystallinity, and excellent chemical stability. Interestingly, these two new COFs with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 or 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 units showed remarkable binding ability of K+ or Cs+ owing to the size&#8208;fit effect. This work demonstrated that the unique structural features of crown ethers will lead to increase interest in fabricating COFs with crown ethers.

         <title>Perovskite Oxide&#8211;Halide Solid Solutions: A Platform for Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9953-9958, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite oxide&#8211;halide solid solutions have attractive features, such as highly mixed oxide&#8211;fluoride octahedrons with different elements and valences, uniform element distributions, and single&#8208;phase crystalline structures. Perovskite oxide&#8211;halide solid solutions prepared by mechanochemical synthesis have great potential to surpass traditional perovskites as electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The successful integration or hybridization of perovskite oxides with their halide cousins would enable the formation of both multi&#8208;anionic and multi&#8208;cationic solid solutions with unique metal&#8208;ion sites and synergistic properties that could potentially surpass the performance of classic perovskites. However, such solid solutions had not been produced previously owing to their distinct formation energies and different synthesis conditions. Solid solutions combining perovskite oxides with fluorides were produced in this study by mechanochemical synthesis. The obtained perovskite oxide&#8211;halide solid solutions had highly mixed elements and valences, uniform element distributions, and single&#8208;phase crystalline structures. The solid solution with an optimized combination of oxides and fluorides exhibited enhanced catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>Formate Dehydrogenases Reduce CO2 Rather than HCO3&#8722;: An&#8201;Electrochemical Demonstration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9964-9967, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, inexpensive and fast method based on protein film electrochemistry is proposed to discriminate whether CO2 or HCO3&#8722; is the substrate of any catalyst interacting with an electrode. In this study, CO2 rather than HCO3&#8722; is found to be the substrate of both formate dehydrogenase and CO dehydrogenase.







Abstract
Mo/W formate dehydrogenases catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 species to formate. It is thought that the substrate is CO2 and not a hydrated species like HCO3&#8722;, but there is still no indisputable evidence for this, in spite of the extreme importance of the nature of the substrate for mechanistic studies. We devised a simple electrochemical method to definitively demonstrate that the substrate of formate dehydrogenases is indeed CO2.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkenes with Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9936-9940, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tertiary amines can be used as substrates for the highly regioselective intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes in the presence of a cationic titanium catalyst generated in situ from tetrabenzyltitanium and Ph3C[B(C6F5)4]. While in most cases, the involved C&#8722;H bond activation reaction occurs at N&#8208;methyl groups, N&#8208;methylazepane and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine also undergo alkylation at the methylene group in position &#945; to the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The first cationic titanium catalyst system for the intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes with various tertiary alkylamines is presented. Corresponding reactions which involve the addition of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of a tertiary amine across the C&#8722;C double bond of an alkene take place at temperatures close to room temperature with excellent regioselectivity to deliver the branched products exclusively. Interestingly, for selected amines, &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation occurs not only at N&#8208;methyl but also at N&#8208;methylene groups.

         <title>Linear Paired Electrolysis&#8212;Realising 200&#8201;% Current Efficiency for Stoichiometric Transformations&#8212;The Electrochemical Bromination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9996-10000, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromination of Alkenes 2.0&#8212;can a stoichiometric chemical transformation exceed a 100&#8201;% yield? No! But there is a way to achieve an eletrochemical current efficiency of up to 200&#8201;% when oxygen is used as the sacrifical starting material. The cathodic reduction of oxygen to H2O2 led to the bromination of alkenes in a linear paired electrolysis in up to perfect 200&#8201;% current efficiency.







Abstract
The generation of bromine by oxidation of bromide anions at the anode and reduction of molecular oxygen at the cathode to hydrogen peroxide resulted in the overall formation of two molecules of Br2 (=four electron oxidation) by passing just two electrons through the solution. The bromine was used for the bromination of alkenes and thereby a linear paired electrolysis was attained which resulted in current efficencies of up to 200&#8201;%. Also, the diiodination of cyclohexene as well as the electrophilic aromatic bromination of an electron&#8208;rich arene were realised both in 168&#8201;% current efficiencies.

&lt;p&gt;The generation of bromine by oxidation of bromide anions at the anode and reduction of molecular oxygen at the cathode to hydrogen peroxide resulted in the overall formation of two molecules of Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (=four electron oxidation) by passing just two electrons through the solution. The bromine was used for the bromination of alkenes and thereby a linear paired electrolysis was attained which resulted in current efficencies of up to 200&#8201;%. Also, the diiodination of cyclohexene as well as the electrophilic aromatic bromination of an electron&#8208;rich arene were realised both in 168&#8201;% current efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Nitrones by Chemoselective Intramolecular Allylic Alkylation of Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9913-9918, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular chemo&#8208; and enantioselective N&#8208;allylation of oximes is reported. The method employs E/Z&#8197;mixtures of oximes and furnishes cyclic nitrones with high enantioselectivity. Tandem N&#8208;allylation/dipolar cycloaddition sequences provide access to enantioenriched tricyclic isoxazolidines and enable the formal synthesis of the marine natural product Halichlorine.







Abstract
The enantio&#8208; and chemoselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;allylation of oximes is described for the first time. Intramolecular kinetic resolution provides access to cyclic nitrones and enantioenriched aliphatic allylic alcohols. Salient features of this transformation are its ability to employ E/Z&#8208;isomeric mixtures of oxime starting materials convergently and high functional group tolerance. The implementation of N&#8208;allylation/1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction sequences furnishes tricyclic isoxazolidines in highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective fashion. The synthetic utility of the approach is demonstrated by the efficient, formal synthesis of the marine natural product (+)&#8208;halichlorine.

         <title>Low Power, Low Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure Plasma&#8208;Induced Polymerization: Facile Synthesis and Crystal Regulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma&#8208;induced polymerization was demonstrated as a fast, facile, and acid catalyst&#8208;free strategy for tailoring of packing phase of COF&#8208;1 by fine&#8208;tuning the synthetic solvent as well as preparing diverse covalent organic frameworks including both two&#8208;dimensional boron&#8208;COFs, Schiff based&#8208;COFs, and three&#8208;dimensional COFs within one hour.







Abstract
Low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma&#8208;induced polymerization was demonstrated as a fast and facile strategy for tailoring of packing phase of COF&#8208;1 as well as preparing diverse covalent organic frameworks (COFs) including both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs. By regulating the solvents, the fast construction of well&#8208;ordered AB staggered COF&#8208;1 and AA eclipsed COF&#8208;1 was facilely realized in minutes. The plasma approach presented here led to the rapid preparation of eight classical 2D COFs, including boronate ester&#8208;linkage (COF&#8208;5, COF&#8208;8 and COF&#8208;10), azine&#8208;linkage (NUS&#8208;2), &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linkage (TpPa, TPBD), imine&#8208;linkage (ILCOF&#8208;1, Py&#8208;COF), and 3D&#8208;COF&#8208;102 (boroxine linkage) in less than 1 hour. Different from conventional methods, the proposed methodology required much less time, lower power, no extra heating, inert&#8208;gas protection and pressure. The fast nucleation and growth of COFs with good crystallinity, morphology and thermal stability can be achieved under mild conditions.

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Mediated Rapid and Sensitive Surface Etching of Gold Nanostars for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9891-9896, April 26, 2021. </description>

We outline a rapid and sensitive nanoparticle etching&#8208;based strategy for biosensing. Iodide modulates the plasmonic features of gold nanostars by etching them into spherical nanoparticles, being a versatile biosensing platform for enzyme detection and plasmonic immunoassays.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;mediated surface etching can tailor the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanostars through etching of the high&#8208;energy facets of the nanoparticle protrusions in a rapid and sensitive way. By exploring the underlying mechanisms of this etching and the key parameters influencing it (such as iodide, oxygen, pH, and temperature), we show its potential in a sensitive biosensing system. Horseradish peroxidase&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of iodide enables control of the etching of gold nanostars to spherical gold nanoparticles, where the resulting spectral shift in the surface plasmon resonance yields a distinct color change of the solution. We further develop this enzyme&#8208;modulated surface etching of gold nanostars into a versatile platform for plasmonic immunoassays, where a high sensitivity is possible by signal amplification via magnetic beads and click chemistry.

Metalloenzymes are of interest for biotechnology and bioinspired catalyst design. The use of rotating ring&#8211;disk electrochemistry and on&#8208;line mass spectrometry is reported for following electroenzymatic hydrogen formation and isotopic product distribution.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;processing metalloenzymes are of interest to future bio&#8208; and bioinspired technologies. Of particular importance are hydrogenases and nitrogenases, which both produce molecular hydrogen (H2) from proton (H+) reduction. Herein, we report on the use of rotating ring&#8211;disk electrochemistry (RRDE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to follow the production of H2 and isotopes produced from deuteron (D+) reduction (HD and D2) using the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum, a model hydrogen&#8208;evolving metalloenzyme. This facilitates enzymology studies independent of non&#8208;innocent chemical reductants. We anticipate that these approaches will be of value in resolving the catalytic mechanisms of H2&#8208;producing metalloenzymes and the design of bioinspired catalysts for H2 production and N2 fixation.

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkanes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9947-9952, April 26, 2021. </description>

We described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodes, by demonstrating the first example of enantioselective reductive cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation with high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive complex molecules. This strategy provided an efficient and facile way for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated alkanes.







Abstract
The trifluoromethyl group represents one of the most functional and widely used fluoroalkyl groups in drug design and screening, while the drug candidates containing chiral trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing carbons are still few due to the lack of efficient methods for the asymmetric introduction of trifluoromethyl group into organic molecules. Herein, we described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodides, for the first time, by utilizing reductive cross&#8208;coupling in enantioselective fluoroalkylation. This novel method has demonstrated high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for substrates containing diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive molecules moieties. This strategy provided an efficient and facile way for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated alkanes.

     alt="Diverse Synthesis of Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkanes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodes, by demonstrating the first example of enantioselective reductive cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation with high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive complex molecules. This strategy provided an efficient and facile way for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated alkanes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trifluoromethyl group represents one of the most functional and widely used fluoroalkyl groups in drug design and screening, while the drug candidates containing chiral trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing carbons are still few due to the lack of efficient methods for the asymmetric introduction of trifluoromethyl group into organic molecules. Herein, we described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodides, for the first time, by utilizing reductive cross&#8208;coupling in enantioselective fluoroalkylation. This novel method has demonstrated high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for substrates containing diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive molecules moieties. This strategy provided an efficient and facile way for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated alkanes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isotopic Labelling of Confined Carbyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9897-9901, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, 13C&#8208;labelling of confined carbyne is achieved by using 13C&#8208;labelled methanol as an extra carbon source filled inside carbon nanotubes for the construction of confined carbyne.







Abstract
Carbyne is a one&#8208;dimensional allotrope of carbon consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms bonded to each other with exceptional strength. Its outstanding mechanical, optical, and electronic properties have been theoretically predicted, but its stability has only been achieved when grown encapsulated in the hollow core of carbon nanotubes. One of the advantages of this confinement is that its properties can be controlled by the chain's length and surrounding environment. We investigated an alternative way of gaining control of its properties is using isotope labelling as tuning mechanism. The optimized liquid precursor was first chosen among several options, which can greatly enhance the yield of the confined carbyne. Then isotopic labelled liquid precursor was encapsulated for further synthesis of isotopic labelled confined carbyne. This allowed us to obtain pioneering results on isotope engineered carbyne with around 11.9&#8201;% of 13C&#8208;labelling using 13C&#8208;methanol as precursor.

         <title>An Affinity&#8208;Based, Cysteine&#8208;Specific ATP Analog for Kinase&#8208;Catalyzed Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 18, Page 9859-9862, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Characterization of kinase&#8211;substrate pairs is an enabling strategy to understand kinase&#8208;related diseases and identify new drug targets. An affinity&#8208;based kinase&#8208;dependent crosslinker, ATP&#8208;MAc, is introduced to capture kinase&#8211;substrate interactions under physiological conditions. Unlike prior ATP&#8208;photocrosslinking analogs, ATP&#8208;MAc covalently links only cysteine&#8208;containing kinases with their substrates without the need for UV light.







Abstract
Kinases mediate cell signaling pathways by catalyzing protein phosphorylation. Irregularities in kinase activity are directly associated with disease conditions. Therefore, methods to identify substrates of a particular kinase are needed to understand signaling cascades in normal and diseased states. Photocrosslinking ATP analogs provide powerful tools to study kinases by covalently linking kinases with substrates. However, the involvement of UV light and nonspecific reactivity of current ATP&#8208;photocrosslinkers challenge kinase&#8211;substrate identification. We report here an affinity&#8208;based crosslinking ATP analog, ATP&#8208;methylacrylamide (ATP&#8208;MAc), that contains a cysteine&#8208;reactive acrylamide crosslinking group, which avoids the UV irradiation and non&#8208;specific reactivity of prior analogs. Using in&#8197;vitro kinase assays, ATP&#8208;MAc acts as a kinase co&#8208;substrate and covalently crosslinks only kinases containing cysteines in the active site. ATP&#8208;MAc was also able to crosslink cellular proteins in lysates, documenting compatibility with cell&#8208;based studies.

         <title>Design of an In&#8208;Cell Protein Crystal for the Environmentally Responsive Construction of a Supramolecular Filament</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin B (TbCatB), which is spontaneously produced in insect cells, is used to fabricate protein bundled filaments. The designed disulfide bonds between the monomers are formed by autoxidation in the isolated crystals.







Abstract
Protein assemblies can be designed for development of nano&#8211;bio materials. This has been achieved by modulating protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, fabrication of highly ordered protein assemblies remains challenging. Protein crystals, which have highly ordered arrangements of protein molecules, provide useful source matrices for synthesizing artificial protein assemblies. Here, we describe construction of a supramolecular filament structure by engineering covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in a protein crystal. Performing in&#8208;cell crystallization of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin&#8197;B (TbCatB), we achieved a precise arrangement of protein molecules while suppressing random aggregation due to disulfide bonds. We succeeded in synthesizing bundled filament from the crystals by autoxidation of cysteinyl thiols after the isolation of the crystals from living cells.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering mesopores into microporous organic cages to create hierarchically porous organic cage was explored. The beneficial effect of hierarchical pores on the selective adsorption properties and enhanced catalytic performances was demonstrated.







Abstract
Imparting mesopores to organic cages of an intrinsic microporous nature to build up hierarchically porous cage soft materials is a grand challenge and will reshape the property and application scope of traditional organic cage molecules. Herein, we discovered how to engineer mesopores into microporous organic cages via their host&#8211;guest interactions with long chain ionic surfactants. Equally important, the ionic head of surfactants equips the supramolecularly assembled porous structures with charge&#8208;selective uptake and release function in solution. Interestingly, such hierarchically porous organic cage can serve as a nanoreactor once trapping enzymes within the cavity, which show 5&#8208;fold enhanced activity of enzymatic catalysis when compared with the free enzymes.

         <title>Cascade Oxidative C&#8722;H Annulation of Thiophenes: Heck&#8208;Type Pathway Enables Concise Access to Thienoacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation provides a rapid access to a new class of planar thienoacenes with superior stability. Heck&#8208;type pathway is firstly exemplified as a superior process enabling multiple C&#8722;H fusions of heteroaromatics for the synthesis of heteroacenes.







Abstract
The pursuit of efficient synthetic route to thienoacenes represents an appealing yet challenging task in the fields of both organic synthetic chemistry and organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H annulation of phenacyl phosphoniums with (benzo)thiophenes via a Heck&#8208;type pathway to provide a new class of planar thienoacenes, which involves the formation of three Caryl&#8208;Caryl bonds and one Caryl&#8722;O bond in a single operation. The neutral S,O&#8208;heteroacenes exhibit superior stability and adopt a herringbone&#8208;like packing mode with efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the crystals, suggesting their potential in organic semiconducting materials. This work first exemplifies the superiority of cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation involving a Heck&#8208;type pathway in the development of concise access to heteroacenes.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework Film for Three&#8208;State Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromism and a Molecular Logic Gate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film was synthesized and exhibited three&#8208;state electrochromic properties with sub&#8208;second response time and long retention time in the near&#8208;infrared region. Taking potential and absorbance as input and output signal, respectively, a mimicking logic gate with optical memory functions was demonstrated based on the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film.







Abstract
A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film with three&#8208;state NIR electrochromic properties was designed and synthesized. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film is composed of hexagonal nanosheets with high crystallinity and has three reversible color states at different applied potentials. It has high absorption spectra changes in the NIR region, ascribed to the strong intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) interaction of the Class III mixed&#8208;valence systems of the conjugated triphenylamine species. The film showed sub&#8208;second response time (1.3&#8197;s for coloring and 0.7&#8197;s for bleaching at 1050&#8197;nm) and long retention time in the NIR region. COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film shows superior NIR electrochromic properties in term of response time and stability, attributed to the highly ordered porous structure and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structure of the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA architecture. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film was applied in mimicking a flip&#8208;flop logic gate with optical memory function.

         <title>Catalytic and Enantioselective Control of the C&#8211;N Stereogenic Axis via the Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic and enantioselective control of the C&#8211;N stereogenic axis of heterocyclic scaffolds is reported. The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction is achieved by employing a chiral phosphoric acid via dynamic kinetic resolution. Application to substituted benzaldehyde enables control of both axial and point chirality.







Abstract
An unprecedented example of a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of N&#8208;arylindoles is reported. Highly enantioenriched N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines with C&#8722;N bond axial chirality are obtained via dynamic kinetic resolution. The hydrogen bond donor introduced on the bottom aromatic ring, forming a secondary interaction with the phosphoryl oxygen, is essential to achieving high enantioselectivity. A wide variety of substituents are tolerable with this transformation to provide up to 98&#8201;% ee. The application of electron&#8208;withdrawing group&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes enables the control of both axial and point stereogenicity. Biological evaluation of this new and unique scaffold shows promising antiproliferative activity and emphasizes the significance of atroposelective synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;Undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;Alpneumine&#8197;H</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C has been synthesized in 11 steps from prochiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)cyclohexan&#8208;1&#8208;one (A). It is subsequently converted into (+)&#8208;undulifoline and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H via reductive N&#8208;methylation and diastereoselective N&#8208;oxidation of the tertiary amine.







Abstract
We report herein the enantioselective total synthesis of three monoterpene indole alkaloids, namely, (+)&#8208;alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H. The key features of our synthesis include: a) introduction of chirality via enantioselective deprotonation of a prochiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone; b) use of methoxymethyl (MOM) ether as both a hydroxyl protective group and a latent oxonium species for the formation of bridged oxepane and c) domino double reductive cyclization to build both the indole and the piperidine ring at the end of the synthesis. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these natural products assigned based on the biogenetic hypothesis.

         <title>Hematite Photoanodes for Water Oxidation: Electronic Transitions, Carrier Dynamics, and Surface Energetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current understanding of hematite photoanodes is comprehensively discussed. In light of guidelines for photoanode design, we focus on charge carriers, their origin, early&#8208;stage dynamics, surface dynamics and their competitive interfacial transfer through the valence band edge, surface states, and cocatalysts.







Abstract
We review the current understanding of charge carriers in model hematite photoanodes at different stages. The origin of charge carriers is discussed based on the electronic structure and absorption features, highlighting the controversial assignment of the electronic transitions near the absorption edge. Next, the dynamic evolution of charge carriers is analyzed both on the ultrafast and on the surface reaction timescales, with special emphasis on the arguable spectroscopic assignment of electrons/holes and their kinetics. Further, the competitive charge transfer centers at the solid&#8211;liquid interface are reviewed, and the chemical nature of relevant surface states is updated. Finally, an overview on the function of widely employed surface cocatalysts is given to illustrate the complex influence of physiochemical modifications on the charge carrier dynamics. The understanding of charge carriers from their origin all the way to their interfacial transfer is vital for the future of photoanode design.

         <dc:description>Here, we describe a series of hafnium complexes with a reduced arene of general formula [K(L)][Hf(Xy&#8208;N  3  N)(arene)] (Xy&#8208;N  3  N = {(3,5&#8208;Me  2  C  6  H  3  )NCH  2  CH  2  }  3  N  3&#8722;  , L = THF, 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; arene = C  10  H 8  2&#8722;  , C  14  H  10  2&#8722;  ) which mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N  3  N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of  tert  &#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand. DFT calculations were performed on electronic structure of the reduced anthracene complex as well as the unusual nitrile insertion mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Arylpalladium(II) Boronates: Confirming the Structure of Pre&#8208;transmetalation Intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Reaction&#160;Crystallographically</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(II) boronates are recognized as fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. While these typically transient species have been detected and studied spectroscopically, it is conspicuous that they have never been isolated since this important reaction was discovered over forty years ago. This study reports the synthesis of a family of unprecedented arylpalladium(II) boronates that are, by design, kinetically stable at ambient temperature, both in solution and in the solid state. These properties enabled unambiguous crystallographic confirmation of their structure for the first time and their chemical competence in a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8208;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2H2  + 2CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722;  promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4  and CO2  to free 2H2  + CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of of COads  from the RhTiO2CO&#8211;  to reform RhTiO2&#8211;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Nanoparticulate Organic Photocatalysts via a Scalable Flash Nanoprecipitation Process for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly converting sunlight into hydrogen fuels using particulate photocatalysts represents a sustainable route for clean energy supply. Organic semiconductors have emerged as attractive candidates but always suffer from optical and exciton recombination losses with large exciton &#8220;dead zone&#8221; inside the bulk material, severely limiting the catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy that combines a scalable flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with hydrophilic soluble polymers (  PC&#8208;PEG5  and  PS&#8208;PEG5  ) to prepare highly efficient nanosized photocatalysts without using surfactants. Significantly, a 70&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is achieved for nanosized  PC&#8208;PEG5  , and the FNP&#8208;processed  PS&#8208;PEG5  shows a peak HER rate of up to 37.2 mmol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  under full&#8208;spectrum sunlight irradiation, which is among the highest results for polymer photocatalysts. Moreover, a scaling&#8208;up production of nanocatalyst is demonstrated with the continuously operational FNP, which provides an unprecedented strategy toward practical applications of particulate photocatalysts for sustainable energy production.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of strained aromatic macrocycles based on [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7(4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrahydro)pyrenylenes is presented with size&#8208;dependent photophysical properties. The  K&#8208;region of pyrene was functionalized with ethylene glycol groups to decorate the outer rim and thereby confine the space inside the macrocycle. This confined space is especially pronounced for&#160;n&#160;=&#160;5, which leads to an internal binding of up to 8.0&#215;10  4&#160;m  &#8211;1  between the ether&#8208;decorated [5]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylene and shape complementary crown ether&#8211;cation complexes. Both, the ether&#8208;decorated [n]cyclo&#8208;pyrenylenes as well as one of their host&#8211;guest complexes have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In combination with computational methods the structural and thermodynamic reasons for the exceptionally strong binding have been elucidated. The presented rim confinement strategy makes cycloparaphenylenes an attractive supramolecular host family with a favorable, size&#8208;independent read&#8208;out signature and binding capabilities extending beyond fullerene guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Allenylidene Induced 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement of Indole&#8208;Boronates: Diastereoselective Access to Highly Substituted Indolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of electrophile, Cu&#8211;allenylidene has been introduced to induce 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Merger of Cu&#8208;catalyzed propargylation and 1,2&#8208;boronate shift has allowed access to densely functionalized chiral indolines with up to three contiguous stereogenic centres in highly diastereoselective fashion (&gt;20:1 dr). Utility of Bpin and alkyne moieties has been demonstrated by subsequent synthetic elaborations.







Abstract
A process to achieve 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of indole boronate as a way to access substituted indolines in high diastereoselectivities is presented. The reaction involves the generation of a Cu&#8211;allenylidene, which is sufficiently electrophilic to induce the 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. The scope of the reaction is evaluated as well as further transformations of the product.

         <title>Beyond Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphines are notorious in acting exclusively as terminal donors, binding a single metal center. We have discovered that a non&#8208;traditional scenario is possible where the phosphorus(III) atom of a R3P ligand bridges three metal atoms at once. Such triply bridging pattern is first observed in the [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes, which also exhibit remarkable luminescence properties.







Abstract
The first example of a triply bridging (&#956;3&#8208;P) phosphine ligand has been discovered in the crown&#8208;shaped [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes supported by tris[2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethyl]phosphine (L).

     alt="Beyond Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphines are notorious in acting exclusively as terminal donors, binding a single metal center. We have discovered that a non&#8208;traditional scenario is possible where the phosphorus(III) atom of a R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P ligand bridges three metal atoms at once. Such triply bridging pattern is first observed in the [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Hal)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes, which also exhibit remarkable luminescence properties.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example of a triply bridging (&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;P) phosphine ligand has been discovered in the crown&#8208;shaped [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Hal)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes supported by tris[2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethyl]phosphine (L). Theoretical analysis completely confirms the observed &#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;P&#8208;bridging pattern, revealing the interaction of the same lone pair of phosphorus with three valence 4s&#8208;orbitals of Cu atoms.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A NaClO4/NaOTF electrolyte was designed for aqueous Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs). The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing NaF&#8211;Na2O&#8211;NaOH forming on the anode extended the cathodic limiting potential of electrolyte to 1.6&#8197;V, and the hydrophobic anions extend the anodic to 4.4&#8197;V. A 1.75&#8197;V Na3V2(PO4)3&#8741;Na3V2(PO4)3 cell achieved a high energy density of 70&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 87.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISE) have largely widened the electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes by formation of passivating solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and also absorption of the hydrophobic anion&#8208;rich double layer on cathode. However, the cathodic limiting potential of WISE is still too high for most high&#8208;capacity anodes in aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs), and the cost of WISE is also too high for practical application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost 19&#8197;m (m: mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) bi&#8208;salts WISE with a wide ESW of 2.8&#8197;V was designed, where the low&#8208;cost 17&#8197;m NaClO4 extends the anodic limiting potential to 4.4&#8197;V, while the fluorine&#8208;containing salt (2&#8197;m NaOTF) extends the cathodic limiting potential to 1.6&#8197;V by forming the NaF&#8211;Na2O&#8211;NaOH SEI on anode. The 19&#8197;m NaClO4&#8211;NaOTF&#8211;H2O electrolyte enables a 1.75&#8197;V Na3V2(PO4)3&#8741;Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell to deliver an appreciable energy density of 70&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C with a capacity retention of 87.5&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

         <title>When Fluxionality Beats Size Selection: Acceleration of Ostwald Ripening of Sub&#8208;Nano Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For supported nanoclusters at typical catalytic temperatures, Ostwald ripening is strongly accelerated by structural fluxionality, even in the regime of cluster size&#8208;selection. Hence, a revision of the theory of Ostwald ripening is proposed.







Abstract
Size selection was demonstrated to suppress Ostwald ripening of supported catalytic nanoparticles. When the supported clusters are subnanometer in size and highly fluxional, such as Pt clusters on the rutile TiO2(110) surface, this paradigm breaks down, and the established theory of sintering needs a revision. At temperatures characteristic of catalysis (i.e. 700&#8197;K), sub&#8208;nano clusters thermally populate many low&#8208;energy metastable isomers. As these isomers all have different geometric and electronic structures, and thus, formation and dissociation energies (in lieu of surface energy), Ostwald ripening is not suppressed, despite the size&#8208;selection. However, some clusters arise as magic numbers in terms of sintering stability at the ensemble level. Acceleration of sintering by metastable species persists though weakens in polydisperse cluster systems. We propose a competing pathways theory for sintering, which at the atomistic level describes the found size&#8208;specific sintering behavior.

         <title>Design of Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Cr2O3 Spheres for Metabolic Fingerprinting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres displayed strong photo&#8208;response for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites, thereby enabling fast and sensitive metabolic profiling in bio&#8208;fluids. Based on the decoded urine and serum metabolic fingerprints, we performed machine learning to discriminate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls with high specificity and selectivity.







Abstract
Schizophrenia (SZ) detection enables effective treatment to improve the clinical outcome, but objective and reliable SZ diagnostics are still limited. An ideal diagnosis of SZ suited for robust clinical screening must address detection throughput, low invasiveness, and diagnosis accuracy. Herein, we built a multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres (MHCSs) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) platform for the direct metabolic profiling of biofluids towards SZ diagnostics. The MHCSs displayed strong light absorption for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites. We profiled urine and serum metabolites (&#8776;1&#8197;&#956;L) with the enhanced LDI efficacy in seconds. We discriminated SZ patients (SZs) from healthy controls (HCs) with the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 1.000 for the blind test. We identified four compounds with optimal diagnostic power as a simplified metabolite panel for SZ and demonstrated the metabolite quantification for clinic use. Our approach accelerates the growth of new platforms toward a precision diagnosis in the near future.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of N&#8208;Aryl Maleimides Leading to the Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl Succinimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides is presented. The reaction proceeds via the Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation. Preliminary studies on the rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond and detailed DFT studies on the mechanism are also provided.







Abstract
Although the construction of axially chiral C&#8722;C bonds leading to the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls and allied compounds are well&#8208;known, the related synthesis of compounds bearing axially chiral C&#8722;N bonds are relatively rare. Described herein is the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides. The NHC involved intermolecular Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation afforded N&#8208;aryl succinimides in good yields and ee values. Preliminary studies on rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond, the temperature dependence, and detailed DFT studies on mechanism are also provided.

The NHC involved intermolecular Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation afforded N&#8208;aryl succinimides in good yields and &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; values. Preliminary studies on rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond, the temperature dependence, and detailed DFT studies on mechanism are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Human oxygenase variants employing a single protein Fe(II) ligand are catalytically active</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aspartate/asparagine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (AspH) is a human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II) oxygenase that catalyzes C3 hydroxylations of aspartate/asparagine residues of epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domains (EGFDs). Unusually, AspH employs two histidine residues to chelate Fe(II) rather than the typical triad of two histidine and one glutamate/aspartate residue. We report kinetic, inhibition, and crystallographic studies concerning human AspH variants in which either of its Fe(II) binding histidine residues are substituted for alanine. Both the H725A and, in particular, the H679A AspH variant retain substantial catalytic activity. Crystal structures clearly reveal metal&#8208;ligation by only a single protein histidine ligand. The results have implications for the functional assignment of 2OG oxygenases and for the design of non&#8208;protein biomimetic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Activated In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting AIE Photosensitizer for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maximization of phototoxic damage on tumor with minimized side effect on normal tissue is essential for effective anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). This requires highly cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific or even cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;organelle&#8208;specific synthesis or delivery of efficient photosensitizers (PSs)  in vitro  and  in vivo  , which is difficult to achieve. Herein, we report a strategy of cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;activated PS synthesis, by which an efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) feature can be selectively synthesized as an efficient image&#8208;guided PDT agent inside cancer cells. MOF&#8208;199, a Cu(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework, was selected as an inert carrier to load the PS precursors for efficient delivery and served as a Cu(I) catalyst source for  in&#8208;situ  click reaction to form PSs exclusively in cancer cells. The  in&#8208;situ  synthesized PS showed mitochondria&#8208;targeting capability, allowing potent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific ablation under light irradiation. The high specificity of PSs produced in cancer cells also makes it safer post&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Single Diamond Surface Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological scaffolds with hyperbolic surfaces, especially single gyroid and single diamond structures, have sparked immense interest for creating novel materials due to their extraordinary physical properties. However, the ability of nature to create these unbalanced surfaces has not been achieved in either lyotropic liquid crystals or block copolymer phases due to their thermodynamical instability in these systems.&#160;Here, we report the synthesis of a porous silica scaffold with a single diamond surface structure fabricated by self&#8208;assembly of the poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;  b  &#8208;polystyrene&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(  L  &#8208;lactide) and silica precursors in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water. The single diamond structure with tetrahedral interconnected frameworks was revealed by the electron crystallographic reconstruction. We assume that the formation of single networks is induced by the order&#8208;order phase transition through double diamond/single gyroid structures and related to the energetic change due to the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature. This work may provide new insights into these biologically relevant surfaces and related self&#8208;assembly systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Acid&#8208;Assisted Hydrogenation of Oximes to Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We found that cyclometalated cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complexes are uniquely efficient catalysts in homogeneous hydrogenation of oximes to hydroxylamine products. A stable iridium C,N&#8208;chelation is crucial, with alkoxy&#8208;substituted aryl ketimine ligands providing the best catalytic performance. Several Ir&#8208;complexes were mapped by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis in order to collect steric parameters that might guide a rational design of even more active catalysts. A broad range of oximes and oxime ethers were activated with stoichiometric amounts of methanesulfonic acid and reduced at room temperature, remarkably without cleavage of the fragile N&#8208;O bond. The exquisite functional group compatibility of our hydrogenation system was further demonstrated by additive tests. Experimental mechanistic investigations support an ionic hydrogenation platform, and suggest a role for the Br&#248;nsted acid beyond a proton source. Our studies provide deep understanding of this novel acidic hydrogenation and may facilitate its improvement and application to other challenging substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Electric Directional Anisotropy in Polar Soft Ferromagnets of Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) are attracting interest due to their structural tunability and rich functional characteristics, such as ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. Here, we report the chiral&#8208;polar ferromagnetic 2D&#8208;OIHP copper chlorides with discernable electric polarization in the inorganic layers. In these systems, the magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation has been clearly observed by measuring a magneto&#8208;electric directional anisotropy (MEA), in which an optical absorption coefficient changes with reversal of the light propagating direction. We have found that the MEA can be induced by a low magnetic field of ~50 mT, reflecting soft magnetic nature. The present results suggest a new paradigm for designing functional ME multiferroics, which effectively couples magnetic and electric properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetically Engineered Polypeptide Adhesive Coacervates for Surgical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adhesive hydrogels have been developed for wound healing applications. However, their adhesive performance is impaired dramatically due to their high swelling on wet tissues. To tackle this challenge, we fabricated a new type of non&#8208;swelling protein adhesive for underwater and  in vivo  applications. In this soft material, the electrostatic complexation between supercharged polypeptides with oppositely charged surfactants containing 3,4&#8208;dihydroxylphenylalanine or azobenzene moieties plays an important role for the formation of ultra&#8208;strong adhesive coacervates. Remarkably, the adhesion capability is superior to commercial cyanoacrylate when tested in ambient conditions. Moreover, the adhesion is stronger than other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives in underwater environment. The&#160;ex vivo  and  in vivo  experiments demonstrate the persistent adhesive performance and outstanding behaviors for wound sealing and healing. Thus, this new type of genetically engineered adhesive coacervates is a very promising alternative for surgical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the unprecedented stereochemistry of an enzymatic nitrile synthesis through a combined computational and experimental approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic  E&#8208; and  Z&#8208;aldoximes with formation of both opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising  in silico  mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave a detailed insight why with the same enzyme the use of racemic  E&#8208; and  Z&#8208;aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with an increased and decreased cavity in the active site have then been prepared and used in biotransformations, showed the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses. This validated model also enabled the rational design of mutants with a decreased size of the cavity, which gave superior enantioselectivities compared to the known wild&#8208;type enzyme with excellent E&#8208;values of up to E&gt;200 when utilizing the mutant OxdRE&#8208;Leu145Phe.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;In&#8208;Conjugation&#8208;Boosted Organic Semiconductor Gas Sensors Work at High Temperature and Immune to Moisture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrical gas sensors have been developed for many decades because of their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, their industrialization is severely hindered by their intrinsic humidity susceptibility and poor recovery. Conventional organic sensory materials can only operate at room temperature owing to their weak intermolecular interactions. In this work, we demonstrate that the concept of ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation enables organic gas sensors to operate at 100 &#176;C and 70% relative humidity (RH) with almost complete recovery using a coronate polymer (poly&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;biphenylcroconate) as a prototype material for detecting nitric dioxide (NO  2  ). The fabricated sensor has a lower detection limit at the parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) level, while affording the highest sensitivity (2526 ppm  &#8208;1  at 40 ppb) compared with those of all other reported NO  2  chemresistive sensors. In addition, the in&#8208;situ sum&#8208;frequency generation spectra (SFG) at room temperature and 100 &#176;C reveal that charge transfer increases with temperature. Theoretic calculations and in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) confirm the ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8208;inspired hydrogen bond as key for excellent sensitivity. A NO  2  alarm system operating under the atmosphere is assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensor. This study demonstrates ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation as a promising concept for designing a robust gas sensor and provides a foundation for the practical application of organic gas sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable acidic water oxidation with a cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide catalyst operating via a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability and expense of anodes for water electrolyzers with acidic electrolytes can be overcome through the implementation of the cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide electrocatalyst, [Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Pb]Ox, that is self&#8208;healing in the presence of dissolved metal precursors. However, the latter requirement is pernicious for the membrane and especially the cathode half&#8208;reaction since Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors poison the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum H2 evolving catalyst. To address this, we demonstrate the invariably stable operation of [Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Pb]Ox in acidic solutions through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism without the addition of Pb2+ and Fe3+ and investigate the kinetics of the process. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that low concentrations of Co2+ in the solution stabilize the catalytically active Co(Fe) sites. The highly promising performance of this system is showcased by steady water electrooxidation at 80&#160;&#176;C and 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, using a flat electrode, at an overpotential of 0.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.01 V on a one&#8208;week timescale.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplified Interfacial Effect on Atomically Dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd 2D Inverse Nanocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed oxide&#8208;on&#8208;metal inverse nanocatalysts provide a practicable blueprint to amplify the strong oxide&#8208;metal interactions for heterocatalysis but remain a grand challenge in fabrication. Here we report a 2D inverse nanocatalyst, named RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets, by in&#8208;situ creating atomically dispersed RuOx/Pd interfaces densely on ultrathin Pd nanosheets via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The products deliver unexpected performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline, which represents 8.0&#8208; and 22.4&#8208;fold enhancements in mass activity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively, showcasing an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations validate that the RuOx/Pd interfaces can accumulate partial charge from the 2D Pd hosts and subtly change the adsorption configuration of O2 to facilitate the O&#8211;O bond fracture. Meanwhile, the d&#8208;band center of Pd nanosubstrates is factually down&#8208;shifted for weakening the oxygen binding strength, tandemly motivating the excellent ORR catalysis on the RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable lithium&#8208;metal battery achieved by a safe electrolyte based on recyclable and low&#8208;cost molecular sieve</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one typical clean&#8208;energy technologies, lithium&#8208;metal batteries, especially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental&#8208;unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially&#8208;available low&#8208;cost and environmental&#8208;friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium&#8208;ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF  6  &#8208;EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Inspiringly, the new&#8208;designed electrolyte exhibited largely enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation stability under high&#8208;voltage (4.6 volts) and elevated temperature (55  o  C). NCM&#8208;811//Li cells assembled with this electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;stable rechargeabilities (over 1000 cycles for half&#8208;cell; 300 cycles for pouch&#8208;cell). More importantly, sustainable NCM&#8208;811//Li pouch&#8208;cell with negligible capacity decay can also be obtained through using recyclable zeolite sieved electrolyte. This conceptually&#8208;new way in preparing safe and highly&#8208;efficient electrolyte by using low&#8208;price molecular sieve would accelerate the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>The cytochrome P450 catalyzing C&#8208;S bond formation in S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial sulfur&#8208;containing secondary metabolites show various biological activities and the C&#8208;S bond&#8208;forming in their biosynthetic metabolism has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we present genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CxnD exhibiting C&#8208;S bond forming activity&#160;in  S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.  In vivo  and  in&#160;vitro  analyses demonstrated that CxnD generated an indole&#8208;fused dihydrothiopyran skeleton from a  L&#8208;Trp&#8208;derived thiol&#160;intermediate. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CxnD in complex with a substrate analogue and structure&#8208;based mutagenesis revealed intimate details of the substrate binding mode. A radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group&#160;of the substrate was proposed for CxnD, which provided valuable insights into the molecular basis for the intra&#8208;molecular C(sp2)&#8208;H thiolation by the P450 in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing interfacial electronic effects on single&#8208;molecule adsorption geometry and electron transport at atomically&#8208;flat surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clarifying interfacial electronic effects on molecular adsorption is of great significance in many chemical and biochemical processes but remains a challenge. Here, we have successfully used STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy technique to probe electron transport and adsorption geometries of pyridyl molecules at Au(111). Modifying Au(111) surface with 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation&#8208;containing ionic liquids (ILs) decreases surface electron density and stabilizes a vertical orientation of pyridine through nitrogen atom &#963;&#8208;bond interactions, resulting in uniform adsorption configurations for forming molecular junctions. Furthermore, fine modulation from vertical, tilted, to flat, is achieved on adding water to ILs, leading to a new peak around 1633 cm  &#8208;1  ascribed to CC stretching mode of adsorbed pyridyl ring and 316% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance. Combining with DFT calculation reveals that the dihedral angle between adsorbed pyridyl ring and surface decreases with increasing surface electronic density, which enhances electron&#8208;donation from surface to pyridyl ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Switches Regulated by Post&#8208;Transition/Transition Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural transition metal ions: Post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions can induce, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. We exploited such property for elaborating fluorescent aptamer probes that switch between inert, metal ion&#8208;complexed and active, target&#8208;bound states. This very simple structural switching strategy was applied to the homogeneous&#8208;phase detection of small organics using diversely structured aptamers.







Abstract
We introduced an aptamer switch design that relies on the ability of post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions to trigger, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. In the absence of molecular target, the addition of one such metal ion to usual aptamer working solutions promotes the formation of an alternative, inert DNA state. Upon exposure to the cognate compound, the equilibrium is shifted towards the competent DNA form. The switching process was preferentially activated by metal ions of intermediate base over phosphate complexation preference (i.e. Pb2+, Cd2+) and operated with diversely structured DNA molecules. This very simple aptamer switch scheme was applied to the detection of small organics using the fluorescence anisotropy readout mode. We envision that the approach could be adapted to a variety of signalling methods that report on changes in the surface charge density of DNA receptors.

         <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Determination of Hydride Locations in Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep covolutional neural networks, trained on existing examples with known hydride locations from neutron diffraction, were able to accurately predict hydride locations given an X&#8208;ray structure of copper&#8208;hydride nanoclusters, thereby relieving the need of neutron diffraction.







Abstract
Although the coordinates of the metal atoms can be accurately determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, locations of hydrides in metal nanoclusters are challenging to determine. In principle, neutron crystallography can be employed to pinpoint the hydride positions, but it requires a large crystal and a neutron source, which prevents its routine use. Here, we present a deep&#8208;learning approach that can accelerate determination of hydride locations in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of metal nanoclusters of different sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in predicting the most probable hydride sites and their combinations to determine the total structure for two recently reported copper nanoclusters, [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3&#8722; and [Cu61(StBu)26S6Cl6H14]+ whose hydride locations have not been determined by neutron diffraction. Our method can be generalized and applied to other metal systems, thereby eliminating a bottleneck in atomically precise metal hydride nanochemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward preparation of photochromic siloles based on the dithienylethene motif is developed. It relies upon an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of a 2,3&#8208;bis(3&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;silirene with terminal alkynes in mild conditions. The reaction is functional group&#8208;tolerant and can be performed in high yields with a variety of functional terminal alkynes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ nano&#8208;crystallization well ease volume exchange of the hierarchical particle and a stable and robust SEI formed on the particle enable (BiO)2CO3 based electrode a highly stable cycling performance during 1500&#8197;cycles, providing a new sight for anode materials design and an understanding about the relationship between solvation and SEI formation.







Abstract
For advanced anode materials involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy chemistry for potassium ion batteries (PIBs), two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bismuth subcarbonate (BCO) nanosheets that possess high theoretical capacity of 631&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 are proposed. The large lattice spacing of 0.683&#8197;nm along b axis facilitate insertion of K+ ion to boost high&#8208;capacity delivery of ca. 610&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the in situ nano&#8208;crystallization well ease volume changes of the integrated particle and shorten ion diffusion path during potassiation/depotassiation. After coupling with a concentrated KFSI&#8208;G2 electrolyte, the robust and efficient SEI built from enhanced participation of FSI&#8722; synergistically endow structural stability of the flower&#8208;like BCO, and enable a prolonged cycling performance with capacity of ca. 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 1500&#8197;cycles, achieving an ultralow decay rate of 0.007&#8201;%. Mechanistic investigations probe the electrochemistry involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy and phase transition of the electrode.

         <title>Molecular Origin of Blood&#8208;based Infrared Spectroscopic Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared spectroscopy of liquid biopsies is a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective approach that may advance biomedical diagnostics. However, molecular nature of disease&#8208;related changes of infrared molecular fingerprints (IMFs) remains poorly understood, impeding the method&#8217;s applicability. Here we probe 148 human blood sera and reveal the origin of the variations in their IMFs. To that end, we supplemented infrared spectroscopy with biochemical fractionation and proteomic profiling, providing molecular information about serum composition. Using lung cancer as an example for a medical condition, we demonstrate that the disease&#8208;related differences in IMFs are dominated by contributions from twelve highly abundant proteins &#8208; that, if used as a pattern, may be instrumental for detecting malignancy. Tying proteomic to spectral information and machine learning advances our understanding of infrared spectra of liquid biopsies, a framework that could be applied to probing of any disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Temperature Aqueous Battery with Proton Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional aqueous batteries usually suffer from serious capacity loss under subzero conditions due to the freeze of electrolytes. To realize the utilization of aqueous batteries in extremely cold climates, low&#8208;temperature aqueous battery systems have to be developed. Herein, an aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on p&#8208;chloranil/reduced graphene oxide (PCHL&#8208;rGO) in H2SO4 electrolyte is developed. Such aqueous Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries display H+ insertion chemistry, which endow the batteries with fast reaction kinetics and high rate capability. In addition, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be significantly damaged in electrolyte by modulating the interaction between SO42&#8208; and water molecules, lowering the freezing point of electrolyte. As a result, the Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries deliver extraordinary electrochemical performance even at &#8208;70 &#176;C. This work will broaden the horizons of aqueous batteries and open up new opportunities to construct low&#8208;temperature aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Red Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox method was developed for fabrication of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs). Cysteine was responsible for assembly of the RPNSs, and the addition of acetylacetonate enabled the construction of doped RPNSs. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results confirmed that native RPNSs induce drastic autophagy in tumor chemotherapy.







Abstract
Among phosphorus&#8208;based nanomaterials, layered black phosphorus and violet phosphorus have been actively explored in the past decade. However, methods for the synthesis of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs) is lacking, even though red phosphorus (RP) is commercially available at low cost and has excellent chemical stability at room temperature. We report an efficient strategy for fabrication of RPNSs and doped RPNSs using cysteine as a reducing reagent. Data from in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies suggested that RPNSs can trigger production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and subsequent autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death in a shape&#8208;dependent manner. Our findings provide a method for construction of layered RP nanomaterials and they present a unique mechanism for the application of phosphorus&#8208;based materials in nanomedicines.

         <title>Compression&#8208;Driven Internanocluster Reaction for Synthesis of Unconventional Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compression&#8208;driven internanocluster reaction in the solid state of Au25 was firstly demonstrated by introducing high pressure technology and a novel unconventional NC Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 was obtained. Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 NC consists of a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, which has not been previously reported and endows it with enhanced photoluminescence.







Abstract
Can the active kernels in ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) react with one another, or can the internanocluster reaction occur when they are in close enough proximity? To resolve this fundamental issue, we investigated the solid&#8208;state internanocluster reaction of the most studied gold NC Au25(SR)18 (SR: thiolate). A novel NC was produced by increasing the pressure to 5&#8197;GPa, whose composition was determined to be Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 by mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. As revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, the structure, a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, has not been reported and endows the NC with obvious photoluminescence. DFT calculations indicate that the staples contribute substantially to the absorption properties. Further experiments reveal the pressure (internanocluster distance) can tune the internanocluster reaction, and the resulting product is not necessarily the thermodynamic product.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Interaction Modulation in Porous Coordination Polymers for Inverse Selective CO2/C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity is achieved through precise steric design of amino groups in the pore surface to provide enhanced CO2&#8211;framework interactions and suppressed C2H2 adsorption. The obtained two new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) exhibit high CO2 uptake and strong separation performance for one&#8208;step C2H2 purification at room temperature, which can be considered as new physisorbents with this specific inverse selectivity.







Abstract
Controlling gas sorption by simple pore modification is important in molecular recognition and industrial separation processes. In particular, it is challenging to realize the inverse selectivity, which reduces the adsorption of a high&#8208;affinity gas and increases the adsorption of a low&#8208;affinity gas. Herein, an &#8220;opposite action&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for boosting CO2/C2H2 selectivity in porous coordination polymers (PCPs). A precise steric design of channel pores using an amino group as an additional interacting site enabled the synergetic increase in CO2 adsorption while suppressing the C2H2 adsorption. Based on this strategy, two new ultramicroporous PCP physisorbents that are isostructural were synthesised. They exhibited the highest CO2 uptake and CO2/C2H2 volume uptake ratio at 298&#8197;K. Origin of this specific selectivity was verified by detailed density functional theory calculations. The breakthrough separation performances with remarkable stability and recyclability of both the PCPs render them relevant materials for C2H2 purification from CO2/C2H2 mixtures.

         <title>Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A so&#8208;called &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; program has been developed to foresee and predict the yield and stereoselectivity of glycosylation reactions based on the properties of various donors, acceptors, activation systems and solvents. The program statistically analyzes and compares the relative reactivity value (RRV) of donors and the acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) of acceptors.







Abstract
The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We have developed a database of acceptor nucleophilic constants (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithms. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well&#8208;defined reactivity and promoters were organized and processed by the designed software program &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; for prediction of glycosylation reactions without involving sophisticated computational processing.

     alt="Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A so&#8208;called &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; program has been developed to foresee and predict the yield and stereoselectivity of glycosylation reactions based on the properties of various donors, acceptors, activation systems and solvents. The program statistically analyzes and compares the relative reactivity value (RRV) of donors and the acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) of acceptors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We have developed a database of acceptor nucleophilic constants (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithms. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well&#8208;defined reactivity and promoters were organized and processed by the designed software program &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; for prediction of glycosylation reactions without involving sophisticated computational processing. The importance of Aka was further verified by random forest algorithm, and the applicability was tested by the synthesis of a Lewis A skeleton to show that the stereoselectivity and yield can be accurately estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Single&#8208;Site vs Cluster Catalysis in High Temperature Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The behavior of single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters for high temperature oxidation reactions has been investigated using CHA zeolite. Subtle changes in the atomic structure of the active sites are responsible for drastic changes in performance driven by specific interactions between the metal, the gas&#8208;phase components, and the support &#8213; in our case, a well&#8208;defined, non&#8208;reducible macro&#8208;ligand. The high&#8208;stability of these molecular sites in CHA is a key to intrinsic structure&#8208;performance descriptions of elemental steps such as O2 dissociation, and subsequent oxidation catalysis of industrial interest, such as the combustion of methane, propane, and CO. Whereas single Pt&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles larger than ~ 1 nm are unable to activate, scramble and desorb two O2 molecules in isotopic exchange experiments at moderate T (i.e. 200&#8304;C), clusters &lt; 1 nm can do so catalytically, but are unstable against oxidative fragmentation under reaction conditions, leading to catalyst deactivation. For oxidation processes that require the activation of rather inert molecules at high T, like alkanes, catalytic combustion is attributed to stable single Pt atoms when the support is CHA, generated in situ in the O2 stream. The alkane combustion activity is facilitated when the reacting alkane includes weaker C&#8208;H bonds (e.g. propane vs methane), and the C&#8208;H cleavage is inferred to be rate&#8208;determining, which is less sensitive to changes in the active site size compared to the effect on the O2 scrambling. When the combustion involves a strong reductant such as CO, in contrast, the catalysis is dominated by metal clusters and nanoparticles, and not single Pt atoms, as the latter do not form stable mononuclear carbonyl species in the zeolite. The great stability of single Pt atoms for methane combustion, and of small Pt clusters for CO oxidation, including upon regeneration and/or steaming, open new opportunities for the system in a variety of high temperature oxidation scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>A supramolecular complex of C60&#8208;S with high&#8208;density active sites as&#160;cathode for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The well&#8208;known &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the low sulfur utilization hinder the practical application of lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Herein, we develop a novel C  60  &#8208;S supramolecular complex with high&#8208;density active sites for LiPSs adsorption by a simple one&#8208;step process as the cathode material for Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the co&#8208;crystal structure, 100% of C  60  molecules in the complex can offer active sites to adsorb LiPSs and catalyze&#160;its conversion. Furthermore, the lithiated C  60  cores are beneficial to promote the internal ion transport&#160;inside the composite cathode. At a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 &#956;L mg  &#8722;1  , the C  60  &#8208;S cathode with a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm  &#8208;2  exhibits a high capacity of 809 mAh g  &#8208;1  (3.2 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ). The exploration of C  60  &#8208;S supramolecular complex inspires the invention of a new family of S/fullerenes as cathode for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries and as well as extends the application of fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of organic photocatalysts has revolutionized the field of photoredox catalysis as it allowed access to new reactivities that were traditionally restricted to transition metal photocatalysts. In this review we focus our attention onto two classes of organophotocatalysts, namely acridinium ions and cyanoarenes derivatives that have demonstrated remarkable activities in large variety of organic transformations. Specifically, the use of those photocatalysts in oxidative quenching processes will be discussed with a special focus on their mechanistic aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncanonical heme ligands steer carbene transfer reactivity in an artificial metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Changing the primary metal coordination sphere is a powerful strategy for tuning metalloprotein properties. Here we used amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including two newly evolved enzymes, to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with N  &#948;  &#8208;methylhistidine, 5&#8208;thiazoyl&#173;alanine, 4&#8208;thiazoylalanine and 3&#8208;(3&#8208;thienyl)alanine. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &gt;200 mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein&#8217;s carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate. Variants with increased reduction potential proved superior for cyclopropanation and N&#8208;H insertion, whereas variants with reduced  E  o  values gave higher S&#8208;H insertion activity. Given the functional importance of histidine in many enzymes, these genetically encoded analogues could be valuable tools for probing mechanism and enabling new chemistries.</dc:description>

Abstract
A one&#8208;step synthetic pathway for the preparation of fully conjugated &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;azaDIPY hybrid chromophores comprised of &#946;&#8208;isoindigo and azadipyrromethene moieties is reported. The target compounds were characterized by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and theoretical methods and show unprecedented broad absorption across the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the octa(n&#8208;butyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;azaDIPY derivative revealed that a trans&#8208;configuration of the &#946;&#8208;isoindigo fragment accompanies a planar conjugated core.

         <title>Asymmetric Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydrosilylation/Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes is developed to access synthetically versatile chiral alkylsilanes with a catalyst generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and (R,Sp)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of 1,6&#8208;enynes react to afford the corresponding alkylsilanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
We report an enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with secondary and tertiary hydrosilanes employing a catalyst generated in situ from the combination of Co(acac)2 and (R,Sp)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and carbon&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes reacted with Ph2SiH2, (EtO)3SiH, or (RO)2MeSiH to afford the corresponding chiral organosilane products in high yields and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. This cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization also occurred with prochiral secondary hydrosilane PhMeSiH2 to yield chiral alkylsilanes containing both carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity, albeit with modest diastereoselectivity. The chiral organosilane products from this cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation/cyclization could be converted to a variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds by stereospecific conversion of their C&#8722;Si and Si&#8722;H bonds without loss of enantiopurity.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Adjustable Correlated Color Temperature Guided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the guidance of machine learning, the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT (CIE coordinates) of 3107&#8197;K (0.48, 0.51), 4071&#8197;K (0.37, 0.37), and 4548&#8197;K (0.36, 0.36), and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5106&#8197;K (0.34, 0.37), 5632&#8197;K (0.33, 0.33), and 6034&#8197;K (0.32, 0.35) were obtained accurately.







Abstract
Here, we show the fabrication of the carbon dots (CDs) with green and orange emissions from PTCDA (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride). Using these CDs as emitters, the orange (or green) CDs LEDs were fabricated, which show electroluminescence (EL) spectra centered at 560&#8197;nm (or 498&#8197;nm) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.98&#8201;% (1.76&#8201;%) adhering a luminescence of 626&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (or 519&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2). The machine learning was successfully used to predict PL CCT value. With the model, the white photoluminescence (PL) emission with adjustable correlated color temperature (CCT) from 3093 to 11018&#8197;K via combining blue, green, and orange CDs was achieved. Then, we obtained the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT of 3107, 4071 and 4548&#8197;K, and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5632 (CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), EQE: 1.18&#8201;%, luminescence: 598&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2) and 6034&#8197;K accurately.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly &#947;&#8208;regioselective arylation and carbonylative arylation of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, providing the gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The resulting gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes can serve as versatile building blocks for diversified synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that both non&#8208;radical and radical pathways are possible for the reaction, and the radical pathway is more likely. The high &#947;&#8208;regioselectivity results from the &#946;&#8208;bromide elimination of alkylnickel(II) species or from the reductive elimination of nickel(III) species [(aryl)(CF2=CHCH2)NiIII(Ln)X]. The &#947;&#8208;selective carbonylation of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene under 1&#8197;atm CO gas also provides a new way for nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Making Strong Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages and drawbacks of strategies that generate strong graphene materials by eliminating the voids between the graphene platelets and the wrinkling of the graphene platelets are discussed in this Minireview. The fundamental mechanical properties and the wide&#8208;ranging electrical and magnetic properties of the resulting materials are also discussed.







Abstract
Graphene materials have been widely applied in various fields because of their remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, two obstacles arise during the assembly of graphene platelets into macroscale graphene materials and composites that impair the performance of the resultant graphene materials: 1)&#8197;the voids between the graphene platelets, and 2)&#8197;the wrinkling of the graphene platelets. In the past decade, several strategies have been developed to eliminate these obstacles. These strategies result in strong macroscale graphene materials, such as graphene fibers with tensile strengths of over 3.4&#8197;GPa and sheets with tensile strengths of over 1.5&#8197;GPa, which have many practical applications. This Minireview summarizes the effective strategies for assembling graphene materials and compares their advantages and drawbacks. The preparation processes as well as the resulting fundamental mechanical properties and wide spectrum of electrical and magnetic properties are also discussed. Finally, our outlook for the future of this field is presented.

         <title>An All&#8208;in&#8208;One Organic Semiconductor for Targeted Photoxidation Catalysis in Hypoxic Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor hypoxia severely limits the therapeutic effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Although many methods for oxygen generation exist, substantial safety concerns, spatiotenporal uncontrollability, limited efficacy and complicated procedures have compromised their practical application. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of a biocompatiable all&#8208;in&#8208;one organic semiconductor to provide a photoxidation catalysis mechanism of action to combat these challenges. A one&#8208;step and facile method is developed to produce gram&#8208;level C5N2 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based organic semiconductor. Under 650 nm laser irradiation, the semiconductor split water to generate O2 and simultaneously produced singlet oxygen (1O2), revealing that the photocatalyst for O2 evolution and the photosensitizer (PS) for 1O2 generation could be synchronously achieved in one organic semiconductor. Furthermore, the inherent nucleus targeting capacity endows it with direct and efficient DNA photocleavage. These findings pave the way for developing organic semiconductor&#8208;based cancer therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming Fluorogenic DNA Probes for Rapid Detection of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of aptamers to recognize a variety of different molecules has fueled their emergence as effective recognition agents to probe complex media and cells. Many detection strategies necessitate an aptamer binding to its target to result in a dramatic change in structure, typically from an unfolded to a folded state. Here, we report a strategy based on forced&#8208;intercalation (FIT) that increases the scope of aptamer recognition by transducing subtle changes in aptamer structures into fluorescent readouts. By screening a library of green&#8208;fluorescent FIT&#8208;aptamers whose design is guided by computational modeling, we were able to identify hits that sense steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) down to 1.3 &#181;M with no loss in binding affinity compared to the unmodified aptamer. Ultimately, this enabled us to study DHEAS in clinical serum samples with several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30 min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10 &#181;L).</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Mediated Construction of Ultrathin Free&#8208;standing Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new class of crystalline porous organic materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention in proton conduction due to their regular channels and tailored functionality. However, most COFs are insoluble and unprocessable, which makes the membrane preparation for practical usage a challenge. Herein, we employed surface&#8208;initiated condensation polymerization of trialdehyde and phenylenediamine in the synthesis of sulfonic COF (SCOF) coatings. The COF layer thickness can be finely tuned from ten to one hundred nanometers by controlling the polymerization time. Moreover, free&#8208;standing COF membranes were facilely obtained by sacrificing the bridging layer without any decomposition of the COF structure. Benefiting from the abundant sulfonic acid groups in the COF channels, the proton conductivity of SCOF membrane reached to 0.54 S cm  &#8208;1  at 80 &#176;C in pure water. To our knowledge, this is one of the highest values for pristine COF membrane in the absence of additional additives. Our approach would pave the way for the potential application of COF materials in proton conducting membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electro&#8208;reforming of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural on Vertically Oriented Nickel Nanosheet/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts: Structure&#8208;Function Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;promoted electrocatalytic biomass reforming has shown promising prospect in enabling high value&#8208;added product synthesis. Here, we developed a novel hybrid catalyst with Ni nanosheet forests anchored on carbon paper. The hybrid catalyst exhibits high efficiency in electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA coupling with H2 production in high purity. The Ni nanosheets have small crystal grain sizes with abundant edges, which is able to deliver an efficient HMF oxidation to FDCA (selectivity &gt;99%) at low potential of 1.36 VRHE with high stability. The post&#8208;reaction structure analysis reveals the Ni nanosheets would transfer electrons to carbon and readily turn into NiOx and Ni(OH)x during the reaction. DFT results suggest high valence Ni species would facilitate the chemical adsorption (activation) of HMF revealing the reaction pathway. This work emphasizes the importance of the precise control of Ni activity via atomic structure engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters as Model Catalysts for Identifying Active Sites for Electroreduction of CO2&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate identification of active sites is critical for elucidating catalytic reaction mechanisms and developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. Herein, we report the atomic&#8208;level identification of active sites using atomically well&#8208;defined gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) Au  25  , Au  38  , and Au  144  as model catalysts in the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). The studied Au NCs exhibited remarkably high CO  2  RR activity, which increased with increasing NC size. Electrochemical and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the Au NCs were activated by removing one thiolate group from each staple motif at the beginning of CO  2  RR. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed higher charge densities and upshifts of  d  &#8208;states for dethiolated Au sites. The structure&#8211;activity properties of the studied Au NCs confirmed that dethiolated Au sites were the active sites and that CO  2  RR activity was determined by the number of active sites on the cluster surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer from HOO&#8226; to ortho&#8208;Quinones Explains the Antioxidant Activity of Polydopamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanins are stable and non&#8208;toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear. Herein, we show that polydopamine (  PDA  ), a well&#8208;known synthetic melanin, becomes an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO&#8226;, typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO&#8226;). The key reaction explaining this peculiar antioxidant activity is the reduction of the  ortho  &#8208;quinone moieties present in  PDA  by the reaction with HOO&#8226;. This reaction occurs  via  a H&#8208;atom transfer mechanism, as demonstrated by the large kinetic solvent effect of the reaction of a model quinone (3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzoquinone) with HOO&#8226; (  k  = 1.5&#215;10  7  and 1.1&#215;10  5  M  &#8210;1  s  &#8210;1  in PhCl and MeCN). The chemistry disclosed herein is an important step to rationalize the redox&#8208;mediated bioactivity of melanins and of quinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Fast Alkali&#8208;Ion Dynamics in Paramagnetic Battery Materials Combined with NMR and Deep&#8208;Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unambiguous assignment of chemical shift in paramagnetic battery materials relies on first&#8208;principles calculation, while the state&#8208;of&#8208;art computational methodology is limited in sluggish dynamic systems. We incorporate hundreds of nanoseconds deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to expanding the ssNMR application in high&#8208;rate cathode materials.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) has received extensive attention in characterizing alkali&#8208;ion battery materials because it is highly sensitive for probing the local environment and dynamic information of atoms/ions. However, precise spectral assignment cannot be carried out by conventional DFT for high&#8208;rate battery materials at room temperature. Herein, combining DFT calculation of paramagnetic shift and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to achieve the converged Na+ distribution at hundreds of nanoseconds, we obtain the statistically averaged paramagnetic shift, which is in excellent agreement with ssNMR measurements. Two 23Na shifts induced by different stacking sequences of transition metal layers are revealed in the fast chemically exchanged NMR spectra of P2&#8208;type Na2/3(Mg1/3Mn2/3)O2 for the first time. This DPMD simulation auxiliary protocol can be beneficial to a wide range of ssNMR analysis in fast chemically exchanged material systems.

We constructed a series of noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions. Combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were achieved.







Abstract
Noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their advantages of simple synthetic routes, high yields and low costs. However, the efficiencies of NFREAs based organic solar cells (OSCs) are still far behind those of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Herein, a series of NFREAs with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions were designed and synthesized with a two&#8208;step synthetic route. Upon introducing &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;groups into the backbones, the electronic properties, charge transport, film morphology, and energy loss were precisely tuned by fine&#8208;tuning the degree of multi&#8208;fluorination. As a result, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were obtained. This contribution demonstrated that combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering is a simple and effective way to explore high&#8208;performance NFREAs.

         <title>Tailoring a Dynamic Metal&#8211;Polymer Interaction to Improve Catalyst Selectivity and Longevity in Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of polymers with similar framework structures but different metal&#8208;ligating functionalities as supports for Pd catalysts to control the dynamic metal&#8211;polymer interactions (DMPI) and catalytic properties. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface via DMPI, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation.







Abstract
Controlling metal&#8211;support interactions is important for tuning the catalytic properties of supported metal catalysts. Here, premade Pd particles are supported on stable polymers containing different ligating functionalities to control the metal&#8211;polymer interactions and their catalytic properties in industrially relevant acetylene partial hydrogenation. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;SH and Ar&#8208;S&#8208;Ar) can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation. In contrast, polymers with weakly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;O&#8208;Ar) do not form an overlayer, resulting in non&#8208;selective hydrogenation and fast deactivation, similar to Pd catalysts on conventional inorganic supports. The results imply that tuning the metal&#8211;polymer interactions via rational polymer design can provide an efficient way of synthesizing selective and stable catalysts for hydrogenation.

         <title>A Promising NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Sensor for Peptide&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;term Monitoring of Kidney Dysfunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kidney disease is usually &#8220;silent&#8221; at the early stage but can lead to severe kidney failure later on. The development of bioimaging probes with rapid distribution and long&#8208;term retention in the kidney is significant for precisely diagnosing of renal diseases. Here, a feasible strategy of peptide mediated delivering and long&#8208;term accumulating (&gt;48 h) of second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores into kidney is demonstrated. It is shown that both the hepatic cleared organic molecules and fast renal cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after conjugated to the peptide with high polarity. Moreover, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed based on the kidney targeting peptide, which enables both in vivo long&#8208;term kidney monitoring and in vitro urine detection. The capability of peptide&#8208;based sensor to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression is particularly crucial for chemotherapy regimen optimization and timely renoprotective intervention during medications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Manginoids A and C and Guignardones A and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective synthetic approach for preparing manginoids and guignardones, two types of biogenetically related meroterpenoids, is reported. This bioinspired and divergent synthesis employs an oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization and cyclodehydration of the common precursor to forge the central ring of the manginoids and guignardones, respectively, at a late stage. Key synthetic steps include silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement to form the 6&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton and the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction of vinyl bromide to achieve fragment coupling. This synthesis protocol enables the asymmetric syntheses of four fungal meroterpenoids from commercially available materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Gold Nanocluster Protected with Amidinates for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first all&#8208;amidinate&#8208;protected gold nanocluster [Au28(Ph&#8208;form)12](OTf)2 (Ph&#8208;form = N,N'&#8208;Diphenylformamidine) ( Au28 ) has been synthesized and structurally resolved. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that Au28 has a compact Au4@Au24 tetrahedral core&#8208;shell structure of T symmetry, which is fully protected by 12 bridging formamidinate ligands. This cluster is quite robust as indicated by the fact that it can stay intact in solution at 80 &#176;C for 6 d. It exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the electroreduction of CO2 with 96.5% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8208;0.57 V and a maximum TOF of 48492 h&#8722;1 at &#8208;0.87 V. Its superior stability is also manifested in the fact that the supported catalyst Au28/CNTs maintains stable potentials at ca. &#8208;0.69 V for 40 h with FE(CO)s &gt;91%. A superatomic electron configuration of 1S21P62S21D4 has been clarified by DFT computations, and the strong gold&#8208;ligand binding and geometric shell closure account for the superior stability of Au28 .</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stress granules (SGs) are membrane&#8208;less organelles that assemble in the cytoplasm to organize cellular contents and promote rapid adaptation during stress. To understand how SGs contribute to physiological functions, we used electrochemical measurements to detect electroactive species in SGs. With amperometry, we discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are encapsulated inside arsenite&#8208;induced SGs, and H  2  O  2  is the main species. The release kinetics of H  2  O  2  from single SGs and the number of H  2  O  2  molecules were quantified. The discovery that SGs contain ROS implicates them as communicators of the cellular stresses rather than a simple endpoint. This may explain how SGs regulate cellular metabolism and stress responses. This may also help better understand their cytoprotective functions in pathological conditions associated with SGs such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), cancers and viral infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Neither too Classic nor too exotic: One&#8208;electron Na&#183;B Bond in NaBH3&#8208;&#160;Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is hereby reported that NaBH  3  &#8208;  &#160;cluster exhibits a Na&#183;B one&#8208;electron bond, a well&#8208;established type of electron&#8208;deficient bonding in the literature. The topological analysis of the electron localization function, at the correlated level, reveals that Na  &#8208;  , when approaching the bonding distance, fairly distributes its valence electron pair between two lobes. One of these electrons is used to bond with BH  3  , which participates through its boron empty&#160;  p  &#8208;orbital. Furthermore, the bonding situation of LiBH  3  &#8208;  , KBH  3  &#8208;  , MgBH  3  , and CaBH  3  &#160;global minima structures are similar to that of NaBH  3  &#8208;  , extending the family of these new one&#8208;electron bond systems with biradicaloid character.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperation between a T domain and a minimal C&#8208;terminal docking domain to enable specific assembly in a multiprotein NRPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products from amino acid building blocks. They often consist of multiple polypeptide chains which assemble in a specific linear order via specialized N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal docking domains (N/CDDs). Typically, docking domains function independently from other domains in NRPS assembly. Thus, docking domain replacements enable the assembly of &#8220;designer&#8221; NRPS from proteins that normally do not interact. The multiprotein &#8220;peptide&#8208;antimicrobial&#8208;Xenorhabdus&#8221; (PAX) peptide&#8208;producing PaxS NRPS is assembled from the three proteins PaxA, PaxB and PaxC. Here, we show that the small CDD of PaxA cooperates with its preceding thiolation (T1) domain to bind the NDD of PaxB with very high affinity, establishing a structural and thermodynamical basis for this unprecedented docking interaction, and test its functional importance in vivo in a truncated PaxS assembly line. Similar docking interactions are apparently present in other NRPS systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A four&#8208;coordinate cobalt imido complex, (  t  Bu  mPNP)Co=NMes (  t  Bu  mPNP= modified PNP pincer ligand) has been synthesized from addition of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenylazide (Mes&#8211;N  3  ) to the corresponding dinitrogen complex. The solid&#8208;state structure determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction established a rare, idealized planar geometry with a Co=N bond distance of 1.716(2) &#197;. Magnetic measurements revealed an  S  = 1 ground state with CAS&#8208;SCF calculations supporting radical character on the imide nitrogen. Thermolysis of the cobalt&#8208;imido compound induced selective insertion of the imido group into a Co&#8211;P bond and yielded a three&#8208;coordinate cobalt complex with a distorted T&#8208;shaped geometry. Transition state analysis conducted with DFT calculations established the thermodynamic stability of the P&#8211;N coupled product and provided insight into the exclusive selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Supercharging prions via amyloid&#8208;selective lysine acetylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Repulsive electrostatic forces between prion&#8208;like proteins are a barrier against aggregation. In neuropharmacology, however, a prion&#8217;s net charge (Z) is not a targeted parameter. Compounds that selectively boost prion Z remain unreported. Here, we synthesized compounds that amplified the negative charge of misfolded superoxide dismutase&#8208;1 (SOD1) by acetylating lysine&#8208;NH&#8323;&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;&#160;in amyloid&#8208;SOD1, without acetylating native&#8208;SOD1. &#160;Compounds resembled a &#8220;ball and chain&#8221; mace: a rigid amyloid&#8208;binding &#8220;handle&#8221; (benzothiazole, stilbene, or styrylpyridine); an aryl ester &#8220;ball&#8221;; and a triethylene glycol chain connecting ball to handle. At stoichiometric excess, compounds acetylated up to 9 of 11 lysine per misfolded subunit (&#916;Z&lt;SUB&gt;fibril&lt;/SUB&gt;&#160; = &#8208;8,100 per 10&#179;&#160;subunits). Acetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 seeded aggregation more slowly than unacetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 in vitro and organotypic spinal cord (these effects were partially due to compound binding). Compounds exhibited reactivity with other amyloid and non&#8208;amyloid proteins (e.g., fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein was peracetylated; serum albumin was partially acetylated; carbonic anhydrase was largely unacetylated).</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Micrometer&#8208;Scale Spiral Self&#8208;Assembly in Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Film with Controllable Chiral Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with clear handedness are obtained through self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(methyl methacrylate) bearing azobenzene mesogen side chains, with the aid of enantiopure tartaric acid as chiral additive. The formation of spiral structures can be reversibly controlled by ultraviolet light and heat treatment.







Abstract
The spiral is a fundamental structure in nature and spiral structures with controllable handedness are of increasing interest in the design of new chiroptical materials. In this study, micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with reversible chirality were fabricated based on the assembly of a liquid crystalline block copolymer film assisted by enantiopure tartaric acid. Mechanistic insight revealed that the formation of the spiral structures was closely related to the liquid crystalline properties of the major phase of block copolymer under the action of chiral tartaric acid. The chiral spiral structures with controllable handedness were easily erased under ultraviolet light irradiation and restored via thermal annealing. This facile thermal treatment method provides guidance for fabrication of chiral micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with adjustable chiral properties.

         <title>Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Aggregation Modulated Twin Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, stable in air, from the simplest class of arylene diimides, i.e., pyromellitic diimides, is achieved. Aggregation modulated, colour tuneable phosphorescence emission from cyan to orange&#8208;red in amorphous film and crystalline state is observed. The role of molecular design and weak intermolecular interactions in the observed properties is explained.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, stable in air, from the simplest class of arylene diimides, i.e., pyromellitic diimides, is achieved. Aggregation modulated, colour tuneable phosphorescence emission from cyan to orange&#8208;red in amorphous film and crystalline state is observed. The role of molecular design and weak intermolecular interactions in the observed properties is explained.

         <title>Designing a Single Protein&#8208;Chain Reporter for Opioid Detection at Cellular Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for detecting opioid molecules is reported by Kayla E. Kroning and Wenjing Wang in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101262). These opioid&#8208;sensors are called SPOTIT (single&#8208;chain protein&#8208;based opioid transmission indicator tool). Upon detecting opioids, SPOTIT is activated and generates a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. SPOTIT, based on the mu&#8208;opioid receptor, showed an opioid&#8208;dependent fluorescence signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio up to 12.5 in HEK293T cell culture and up to 4.6 in primary neuron culture. SPOTIT will potentially be useful for high&#8208;throughput screening of opioids in cell cultures and cellular resolution detection of opioids in vivo.

         <dc:description>
A supramolecular coordination cage in the center of a star&#8208;shaped water&#8208;soluble polymer responds to ultrasonication&#8208;induced shear force in solution. As reported by Robert G&#246;stl, Bernd&#8197;M. Schmidt in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102383), the octahedral Pd cage (blue panels) bearing polymer chains (red) on each vertex (metallic) encapsulates pharmaceutically active cargo within its hydrophobic nanocavity and is activated by sonication in aqueous solution entailing complete cargo release upon rupture.

         <title>Stereoselective Directed Cationic Cascades Enabled by Molecular Anchoring in Terpene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designed hydrogen bonds in the active site of terpene cyclases enable the direction of cationic cyclization cascades by molecular anchoring of a substrate's polar functional group. As a result, it is possible to replace multi&#8208;step synthetic routes by one enzymatic step and manufacture valuable apocarotenoids in a highly product&#8208; and stereoselective manner on a gram&#8208;scale, as reported by Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101228).

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Dielectric Property and Energy Transfer on Charge Separation in Non&#8208;Fullerene&#8208;Based Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: In non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, it still remains unclear how excitons efficiently dissociate into free charge carriers even under a tiny driving force (tens of meV) with reduced energy loss. Here, dielectric constants of different non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based solar cells consisting of fluorinated&#8208;thienyl benzodithiophene (BDT&#8208;2F)&#8208;based polymer PM6 as the typical donor, and a selected series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors were precisely measured by a newly developed method. It was found that most of the non&#8208;fullerene acceptors exhibited higher dielectric constants than fullerene derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM). The corresponding photoactive films exhibited not only higher dielectric constants but also the larger dielectric constant differences between donor and non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. These would result in lower exciton binding energy and increased charge dissociation possibility with low geminate losses. Additionally, the overlap between the emission spectrum of donor and absorption spectra of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors would allow the resonance energy transfer from donor to the acceptor in these non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based devices, which was confirmed by investigating the emission spectra of pristine donor (and acceptor) films and corresponding blend films. Such an energy transfer process enhanced the efficient exciton diffusion, promising improved device performance. Therefore, based on the synergistic effect of higher dielectric property and energy transfer on charge separation of selected non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, these results provided strong hints to interpret efficient charge separation for the high device performance with a tiny driving force. Our work paves another path to elucidate the intrinsic physical working mechanism on non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiprotozoal Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships of Synthetic Leucinostatin Derivatives and Elucidation of Their Mode of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leucinostatins are fascinating natural substances, with high potency against many pathogens, but their acute toxicity has prevented therapeutic use. Michael Adams, Rainer Riedl et&#8197;al. demonstrate in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102153) how these could be converted into synthetically more accessible and more selective antiprotozoal agents with broad efficacy and undetectable resistance. This study has not only led to therapeutically applicable agents against parasites but also shows how peptides can be made clinically useful by targeted synthetic transformations.

         <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Single Layer Graphene/Electrolyte Interface: Effect of Solvent on the Interfacial Capacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Change of the potential of zero charge (pzc) of a single layer graphene (SLG) electrode in contact with EMI,TFSI ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte is reported by Yanwu Zhu, Patrice Simon in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202017057). The strong interactions between the SLG surface and the EMI+ cation (red) in neat ionic liquid is weakened in presence of acetonitrile solvent molecules (yellow), leading to a rise of the charge carrier density at the electrolyte/SLG interface and a positive shift of the pzc. This shows the importance of the local sp2 carbon organization on its capacitive behavior and electrochemical performance.

The strong interactions between the SLG surface and the EMI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation (red) in neat ionic liquid is weakened in presence of acetonitrile solvent molecules (yellow), leading to a rise of the charge carrier density at the electrolyte/SLG interface and a positive shift of the pzc. This shows the importance of the local sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon organization on its capacitive behavior and electrochemical performance.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is developed to prepare superatomic nanoclusters in a controllable fashion of which an internal&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H)L6 leads to the formation of a highly emissive, two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10L8. Jean&#8208;Yves Saillard, Chen&#8208;Wei Liu et&#8197;al. explain in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100965) that the metal framework of Ag7 is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H)L6 acts as a both reducing agent and template in the cluster build&#8208;up.

         <dc:description>
Bicyclic peptidomimetics bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. A structure&#8208;based design strategy has been applied to minimize a 52 amino acid binding motif into bicyclic 16&#8208;mer &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics. The biologically most active mimetic exhibits robust cellular uptake and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay, as reported by Tom&#8197;N. Grossmann et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102082).

         <title>Defect Engineering in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Towards Advanced Mixed Matrix Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first demonstrate the deliberate introduction of defects in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be an additional degree of freedom towards highly permselective MOF/polymer mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs). The developed MMM materials based on our concept exhibit promising potential for industrial propylene/propane separation processes as well as universal applicability in other fields.







Abstract
Highly permselective and durable membrane materials have been sought for energy&#8208;efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) comprising a polymer matrix and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for this application; however, rational matching of filler&#8208;matrix is challenging and their separation performances need to be further improved. Here, we propose a novel strategy of &#8220;defect engineering&#8221; in MOFs as an additional degree of freedom to design advanced MMMs. MMMs incorporated with defect&#8208;engineered MOFs exhibit exceptionally high C3H6 permeability and maintained C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, especially with enhanced stability under industrial mixed&#8208;gas conditions. The gas transport, sorption, and material characterizations reveal that the defect sites in MOFs provide the resulting MMMs with not only ultrafast diffusion pathways but also favorable C3H6 sorption by forming complexation with unsaturated open metal sites, confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR studies. Most importantly, the concept is also valid for different polymer matrices and gas pairs, demonstrating its versatile potential in other fields.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Emissive Metallacages as Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages with high fluorescence quantum yield and good processability were prepared. These metallacages were further utilized as coatings of a blue light&#8208;emitting bulb to prepare white&#8208;light emitting diodes, demonstrating their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials.







Abstract
The construction of solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials with high quantum yield and good processability is of vital importance in the preparation of organic light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages are prepared by the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridylphenyl)ethylene, cis&#8208;Pt(PEt3)2(OTf)2 and tetracarboxylic ligands. These metallacages exhibit good emission both in solution and in the solid state because the coordination bonds and aggregation restrict the molecular motions of TPE synergistically, which suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of these metallacages. Impressively, one of the metallacages achieves very high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F=88.46&#8201;%) in the solid state, which is further used as the coatings of a blue LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. The study not only provides a general method to the preparation of TPE&#8208;based metallacages but also explores their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials, which will promote the future design and applications of metallacages as useful emissive devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the fascinating structures and wide applications, porous materials with open frameworks have attracted more and more attentions. Herein, a novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (  XOF&#8208;TPPE  ) was successfully designed and fabricated by iodonium&#8208;bridged N&#183;&#183;&#183;I  +  &#183;&#183;&#183;N interactions between pyridyl groups and I  +  for the first time. The formation of  XOF&#8208;TPPE  and its linear analogue was monitored by  1  H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), IR, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and selected&#8208;area electron diffraction (SAED). The structural model of  XOF&#8208;TPPE  was established based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data and theoretical simulations. Significantly, synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), DLS and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy experiments suggested that  XOF&#8208;TPPE  still maintains a stable 2D framework structure in solutions. This research opens up a novel avenue for the development of organic frameworks materials, and may bring new promising applications for the field of porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Enantioselective Aldol Reactions Catalyzed by Chiral Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct and asymmetric aldol reaction of  N  &#8208;acyl thiazinanethiones with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes is documented. The reaction gives the corresponding  O  &#8208;TIPS protected  anti  aldol adducts in high yields and with a remarkable stereocontrol and atom economy. Furthermore, the straightforward removal of the achiral scaffold provides enantiomerically pure intermediates of synthetic interest, which involve precursors for  anti  &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy carboxylic derivatives. Theoretical calculations account for the observed high stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#183;&#183;&#183;Anion Coinage Bond: the Case of Tetrachloridoaurate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactional landscape in crystalline tetrachloridoaurates of acetylcholine and dimethyl&#8208;propiothetine is characterized by Au  &#8729;&#8729;&#8729;  Cl and Au  &#8729;&#8729;&#8729;  O short contacts. Former interactions assemble the AuCl  4  &#713; units into supramolecular anionic polymers,&#160;and latter interactions append the acetylcholine and propiothetine units to the polymer. The distorted octahedral geometry of the bonding pattern around gold is rationalized based on the anisotropic distribution of the electron density enabling gold to behave as an electrophile (&#960;&#8208;hole coinage bond donor). Computation proves that gold in negatively charged species can function as acceptor of electron density. The attractive nature of Au  &#8729;&#8729;&#8729;  Cl/O interactions described here complement aurophilic bonds in the toolbox of gold centered interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Intramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Fluorophores Based on Substituted Triphenylphosphine Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;based luminescent compounds are rarely investigated because of the low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we demonstrate that introducing steric hindrance groups to the TPP moiety and separating the orbitals involved in the transition can drastically suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay induced by structural distortion of TPP in the excited state. High PLQY up to 0.89 as well as thermally activated delayed fluorescence are observed from the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) molecules with substituted TPP donors (sTPPs) in doped films. The red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve comparable external quantum efficiencies to the control device containing a classical phosphorescent dye, revealing the great potential of the ICT emitters based on electrochemically stable sTPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of First Magnesium Fluorooxoborate with Stable Fluorine Terminated Framework for Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generated light can be tuned to cover almost the entire spectral range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths by utilizing the nonlinear optical crystals with a simple frequency doubling process. Among them, the discovery of novel candidates for the production of deep&#8208;ultraviolet light is by extension a great challenge toward realizing the vast potential. Actually, the availability for this process mainly depends on whether the critical performance can be well coexisted in one practical crystal. Herein, the first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB 5  O 7  F 3  was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical application. It has a sufficiently large nonlinearity and a deep&#8208;ultraviolet phase matching wavelength, indicating that it holds great potential for the production of coherent light below 200 nm. The critical performance enhancement of MgB 5  O 7  F 3  when compared with its isomorphic phases was discussed. More importantly, we demonstrated that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB 5  O 7  F 3  (M = divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cooperatively Activatable, DNA&#8208;based Fluorescent Reporter for Imaging of Correlated Enzymatic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic variation of the expression profile and spatial landscape of multiple enzymes are crucial factors influencing tumor progression and drug treatment. However, the comprehensive analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of existing imaging technologies. Here we reported a cooperatively activatable, DNA&#8208;based fluorescent reporter programmed to detect the correlated activity of dual enzymes, telomerase (TE) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), both in vitro and in vivo. The conformational change of the DNA probe can be orthogonally triggered through TE&#8208;induced DNA elongation and APE1&#8208;mediated specific cleavage, producing a fluorescent signal for imaging the activity of the two enzymes in an AND&#8208;gated manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of the system for specific tumor imaging through &#8216;dual lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8217; strategy, and visualizing the correlated enzymatic activities during drug treatment of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Charge Transfer and Out&#8208;Coupling of A Quasi&#8208;Planar Deep&#8208;Red TADF Emitter: towards Rec.2020 Gamut and External Quantum Efficiency beyond 30%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) displays must have extremely high color saturation of red emission at chromatic coordinates of (0.71, 0.29), which requires simultaneous reduction of desaturated orange and invisible infrared components, therefore remains a big challenge for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we report a deep&#8208;red TADF emitter  p  CNQ&#8208;TPA  , composed of quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (  p  CNQ) acceptor and triphenylamine (TPA) donor.  p  CNQ&#8208;TPA  supported its OLED with desired CIE coordinates of (0.69, 0.31) and the record maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.3% , which is the best red TADF diode with Rec.2020 gamut for UHDTV. It is showed that through tuning  p  CNQ&#8208;TPA  doping concentration, intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer are balanced to synchronously improve emission colour saturation and TADF radiation, and remedy aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, rendering photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reaching 90% for deep&#8208;red emission peaked at ~690 nm. Quasi&#8208;planar structure further endows  p  CNQ&#8208;TPA  with an improved horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation, which increases light out&#8208;coupling ratio to 0.34 for achieving the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device efficiencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Aminoarylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes by Merging Photoredox with Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;Cooperative Bond Activation and Facile Intramolecular Aryl Transfer of Nickel&#8208;Aluminum Pincer&#8208;type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pincer&#8208;type nickel&#8208;aluminum complexes were synthesized using two equivalents of the phosphinoamide, [PhNCH2PiPr2]&#8722;. The Ni(0)&#8722;Al(III) complexes, {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;N2) and {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;COD), where MesPAlP is (Mes)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2, were structurally characterized. The (PAlP)Ni system exhibited cooperative bond cleavage mediated by the two&#8208;site Ni&#8722;Al unit, including oxidative addition of aryl halides, H2 activation, and ortho&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond activation of pyridine N&#8208;oxide. One intriguing reaction is the reversible intramolecular transfer of the mesityl ring from the Al to the Ni site, which is evocative of the transmetalation step during cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The aryl&#8208;transfer product,(THF)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2Ni(Mes), is the first example of a first&#8208;row transition metal aluminyl pincer complex. The addition of a judicious donor enables the Al metalloligand to convert reversibly between the alane and aluminyl forms via aryl group transfer to and from Ni, respectively. Theoretical calculations support a zwitterionic Ni&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Al&#948;+ electronic structure in the nickel&#8208;aluminyl complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed evolution of an improved aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase for incorporation of L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catechol group of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) derived from L&#8208;tyrosine oxidation is a key post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) in many protein biomaterials and has potential as a bioorthogonal handle for precision protein conjugation applications such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates. Despite this potential, indiscriminate enzymatic modification of exposed tyrosine residues or complete replacement of tyrosine using auxotrophic hosts remains the preferred method of introducing the catechol moiety into proteins, which precludes many protein engineering applications. We have developed new orthogonal translation machinery to site&#8208;specifically incorporate L&#8208;DOPA into recombinant proteins and a new fluorescent biosensor to selectively monitor L&#8208;DOPA incorporation in vivo. We show simultaneous biosynthesis and incorporation of L&#8208;DOPA and apply this translation machinery to engineer a novel metalloprotein containing a DOPA&#8208;Fe chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Generation in Dark&#8208;Hypoxia by Catalytic Microenvironment&#8208;Tailored Nanoreactors for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) has a potent anticancer effect, but photosensitized generation of  1  O  2  is inhibited by tumor hypoxia and limited light penetration depth. Despite the potential of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to circumvent these issues by exploration of  1  O  2  &#8208;producing catalysts, engineering efficient CDT agents is still a formidable challenge since most catalysts require specific pH to function and become inactivated upon chelation by glutathione (GSH). Herein, we present a catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactor (CMTN), constructed by encapsulating MoO  4  2&#8208;  catalyst and alkaline sodium carbonate within liposomes, which offers a favorable pH condition for MoO  4  2&#8208;  &#8208;catalyzed generation of  1  O  2  from H  2  O  2  and protects MoO  4  2&#8208;  from GSH chelation due to the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and GSH. Importantly, H  2  O  2  and  1  O  2  can freely cross liposomal membrane, allowing the CMTN with a built&#8208;in NIR&#8208;II ratiometric fluorescent  1  O  2  sensor to achieve monitored tumor CDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid amyloid&#8208;based redox hydrogel for bioelectrocatalytic H2 oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An artificial amyloid&#8208;based redox hydrogel was designed for mediating electron transfer between a [NiFeSe] hydrogenase and an electrode. Starting from a mutated prion&#8208;forming domain of fungal protein HET&#8208;s, a hybrid redox protein containing a single benzyl methyl viologen moiety was synthesized. This protein was able to self&#8208;assemble into structurally homogenous nanofibrils. Molecular modelling confirmed that the redox groups are aligned along the fibril&#8217;s axis, and are tethered to its core via a long, flexible polypeptide chain that allows close encounters between the fibril&#8208;bound oxidized or reduced redox groups. Redox hydrogel films capable of immobilizing the hydrogenase under mild conditions at the surface of carbon electrodes, were obtained by a simple pH jump. In this way, novel bioelectrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2 were fabricated that afforded catalytic current densities of up to 270 &#181;A cm&#8208;2, with an overpotential of 0.33 V, under quiescent conditions at 45&#176;C</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Alkene Hydromethylation via Protonolysis of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl groups are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules. Thus, new tactics to introduce this alkyl fragment into polyfunctional structures are of significant interest. With this goal in mind, a direct method for the Markovnikov hydromethylation of alkenes is reported. This method exploits the degenerate metathesis reaction between the titanium methylidene unveiled from Cp2Ti(m&#8208;Cl)(m&#8208;CH2)AlMe2 (Tebbe&#8217;s reagent) and unactivated alkenes. Protonolysis of the resulting titanacyclobutanes in situ effects hydromethylation in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and site&#8208;selective manner. The broad utility of this method is demonstrated across a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates and basic amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic Coinage Metal Acetylenediide Clusters Showing Tailored Thermochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetelyenediide (C22&#8208;) species have been encapsulated in bimetallic and trimetallic clusters: [(AuL)6Ag7(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (2) and [(AuL)6AgCu6(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (3), L = phenylbis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (PPhpy2). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that they are isostructural and six silver atoms in 2 are replaced with copper in 3. Both clusters have a trefoil skeleton, which can be viewed as three trigonal bipyramidal (LAu&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;AuL)M2Ag (M = Ag/Cu) motifs sharing a common silver atom. TDDFT calculations showed Cu&#8208;doping significantly increases the energy level of (C2&#8208;Cu)&#8208;involved occupied orbital, thus inducing interesting transition coupling of dual&#8208;emission at low temperature. This work not only provides a strategy for constructing heterometallic clusters, but also shows the prospect for pursuing novel thermochromic luminescent materials by incorporating multi&#8208;congeneric metal components.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed synthesis of Hepta&#8208;Differentiated &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: 1 out of 117655 Arrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin remain limited. A thioacetate orienting group expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using DIBAL&#8208;H promoted debenzylation. This method allowed the synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. A random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin poly&#8208;functionalization has fueled progress in their use in multiple applications such as enzyme mimicry, but also in the polymer sciences, luminescence, as sensors or for biomedical applications. However, regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is still very limited. We uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, that expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL&#8208;H) promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy, opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;release driven spirocyclization: The expedient and modular construction of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles harnessing the strain energy of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment is described. From easily accessible ABB&#8208;ketones, electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization gives access to a range of spiro&#8208;azetidines with varying functionalities and ring sizes.







Abstract
Due to their intrinsic rigidity, three&#8208;dimensionality and structural novelty, spirocyclic molecules have become increasingly sought&#8208;after moieties in drug discovery. Herein, we report a strain&#8208;release driven synthesis of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles by harnessing the inherent ring strain of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment. Novel ABB&#8208;ketone precursors bearing silyl&#8208;protected alcohols were synthesized in a single step and shown to engage in electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization&#8208;desilylation reactions. Primary, secondary and tertiary silyl ethers were effectively transformed into a library of new spiro&#8208;azetidines, with a range of substituents and ring sizes. In addition, the products are generated with synthetically useful ketone and protected&#8208;amine functional groups, which provides the potential for further elaboration and for this chemistry to be utilized in the rapid assembly of medicinally relevant compounds.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 leads to the formation of a highly emissive, two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8, without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth.







Abstract
Rational syntheses under controllable reducing conditions in the preparation of superatoms with cluster electron number not exceeding two are challenging. Herein a dithiolate&#8208;stabilized two&#8208;electron silver nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8 (1), is isolated via a self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth. 1 is highly fluorescent at ambient temperature and TD&#8208;DFT calculations indicate that the emission is of 1Px&#8594;1S nature.

         <title>Direct Activation of a Remote C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond Enabled by a Visible&#8208;Light Photosensitized Allene Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activations via excited triplet state of allene derivatives have been demonstrated. The reaction mechanisms were investigated by deuterium labeling and kinetic quenching experiments as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
Despite allene derivatives have been always regarded as a radical accepter in traditional radical chemistry for decades, the reactivity of allene derivatives under excited state in radical chemistry was rarely explored. Herein, we wish to report an example to engage triplet&#8208;excited state of allene moiety as hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) partner in the activation of remote sp3 C&#8722;H bond via visible&#8208;light irradiation under mild reaction conditions with broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. The reaction mechanism involving the generation of triplet excited state of allene derivative and the subsequent HAT process was supported by deuterium labeling, kinetic analysis experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>FRET Modulated Signaling: A Versatile Strategy to Construct Photoelectrochemical Microsensors for In Vivo Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imbedding a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system into a photoactive material is a versatile strategy to construct highly selective PEC sensors for diverse targets, no matter electroactive or electrochemically non&#8208;active. Such a FRET modulated PEC microsensor is able to monitor in situ neurochemicals in the brain.







Abstract
Microelectrode&#8208;based electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors are promising candidates for in vivo analysis of biologically important chemicals. However, limited selectivity in complicated biological systems and poor adaptability to electrochemically non&#8208;active species restrained their applications. Herein, we propose the concept of modulating the PEC output by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The emission of energy donor was dependent on the concentration of target SO2, which in turn served as the modulator of the photocurrent signal of the photoactive material. The employment of optical modulation circumvented the problem of selectivity, and the as&#8208;fabricated PEC microelectrode showed good stability and reproducibility in vivo. It can monitor fluctuations of SO2 levels in brains of rat models of cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion and febrile seizure. More significantly, such a FRET modulated signaling strategy can be extended to diverse analytes.

         <title>An Artificial Phase&#8208;Transitional Underwater Bioglue with Robust and Switchable Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based robust bioadhesive was assembled through complex coacervation. The aggregation trend of valine&#8208;rich domains and the change in the backbone conformational states reversibly triggered the phase transition and the enhanced wet adhesion bonding.







Abstract
Complex coacervation enables important wet adhesion processes in natural and artificial systems. However, existed synthetic coacervate adhesives show limited wet adhesion properties, non&#8208;thermoresponsiveness, and inferior biodegradability, greatly hampering their translations. Herein, by harnessing supramolecular assembly and rational protein design, we present a temperature&#8208;sensitive wet bioadhesive fabricated through recombinant protein and surfactant. Mechanical performance of the bioglue system is actively tunable with thermal triggers. In cold condition, adhesion strength of the bioadhesive was only about 50&#8197;kPa. By increasing temperature, the strength presented up to 600&#8197;kPa, which is remarkably stronger than other biological counterparts. This is probably due to the thermally triggered phase transition of the engineered protein and the formation of coacervate, thus leading to the enhanced wet adhesion bonding.

         <title>Uncovering a Functional Motif of Nonlinear Optical Materials by In Situ Electron Density and Wavefunction Studies Under Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy of determining nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motif (FM) is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. In situ ED analysis is firstly adopted for an NLO material with typical LiB3O5 as an example. The work extracts the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of in situ ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.







Abstract
Exploring nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motifs (FM, the structural origin of NLO efficiency) is vital for the rational design of NLO materials. Normal spectrum techniques applied in studying photon exciting materials are invalid for NLO materials, in which electrons are not excited substantially but only distorted under laser. A general strategy of determining NLO FM is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. The in situ experimental ED and wavefunction of typical NLO material LiB3O5 (LBO) under dark and 360 and 1064&#8197;nm lasers are investigated. Compared with the initial state under dark, the ED of [B3O5]&#8722; unit at functional states under laser irradiation exhibits remarkable changes of topological atomic and bond properties, confirming the NLO FM being [B3O5]&#8722;. The work extracts for the first time the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of in situ ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Methylation of Alkyl Iodides with CO as the C1 Source: Advantaged by Faster Reaction of CuH over CuBpin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source is reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.







Abstract
CuH and CuBpin are versatile catalysts and intermediates in organic chemistry. However, studies that involve both CuH and CuBpin in the same reaction is still rarely reported due to their high reactivity. Now, a study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source is reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversible Surfactant&#8208;Induced Transformation Between Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions and Pickering Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emulsion was stabilized by silica particles in combination with a charge&#8208;reversible surfactant, which can be converted between anionic, zwitterionic and cationic forms by pH trigger. Not only can rapid demulsification be achieved, but the emulsion can also be reversibly switched between an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion and a Pickering emulsion. This strategy endows the emulsion with the capacity for intelligent and precise control of stability as well as viscosity and droplet size.







Abstract
A novel charge&#8208;reversible surfactant, (CH3)2N&#8208;(CH2)10COONa, was designed and synthesized, which together with silica nanoparticles can stabilize a smart n&#8208;octane&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion responsive to pH. At high pH (9.3) the surfactant is anionic carboxylate, which together with the negatively charged silica nanoparticles co&#8208;stabilize flowable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions, whereas at low pH (4.1) it is turned to cationic form by forming amine salt which can hydrophobize in situ the negatively charged silica nanoparticles to stabilize viscous oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) Pickering emulsions. At neutral pH (7.5), however, this surfactant is converted to zwitterionic form, which only weakly hydrophobises the silica particles to stabilize O/W Pickering emulsions of large droplet size. Moreover, demulsification can be achieved rapidly triggered by pH. With this strategy particles can be controlled either dispersed in water or adsorbed at the oil&#8208;water interface endowing emulsions with the capacity for intelligent and precise control of stability as well as viscosity and droplet size.

         <title>Alcohol Dehydrogenases and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I) Catalysts: Design of a Chemoenzymatic Cascade towards Optically Active &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concurrent process involving a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (IPrAuNTf2) and an alcohol dehydrogenase is described for the first time. This cascade approach allows the development of a Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement for the transformation of racemic propargylic alcohols, mostly with good selectivities towards the corresponding E&#8208;allylic ketone intermediates, in aqueous medium, which are subsequently reduced to obtain the desired alcohol enantiomers with excellent optical purities.







Abstract
The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis is used in a two&#8208;step approach, including Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of a series of readily available propargylic alcohols followed by stereoselective bioreduction of the corresponding allylic ketone intermediates, to provide optically pure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted allylic alcohols. This cascade involves a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and an enzyme, demonstrating the compatibility of both catalyst types in aqueous medium under mild reaction conditions. The combination of [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2) and a selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH&#8208;A from Rhodococcus&#8197;ruber, KRED&#8208;P1&#8208;A12 or KRED&#8208;P3&#8208;G09) led to the synthesis of a series of optically active (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ols in good yields (65&#8211;86&#8201;%). The approach was also extended to various 2&#8208;hetarylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, hexynol, and butynol derivatives. The use of alcohol dehydrogenases of opposite selectivity led to the production of both allyl alcohol enantiomers (93&#8208;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) for a broad panel of substrates.

         <title>Ligand Non&#8208;innocence and Single Molecular Spintronic Properties of AgII Dibenzocorrole Radical on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dibenzo&#8208;fused silver corrole (Ag&#8208;1) was synthesized and its electronic state on Ag(111) substrate was studied by STM. Ag&#8208;1 adopted an unprecedented domed geometry with two orientations. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center, were observed by STS, which provide the first spectroscopic evidence for open&#8208;shell AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722;.







Abstract
A facile method for the quantitative preparation of silver dibenzo&#8208;fused corrole Ag&#8208;1 is described. In contrast to the saddle conformation resolved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis for Ag&#8208;1, it adopts an unprecedented domed geometry, with up and down orientations, when adsorbed on an Ag(111) surface. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center were observed by cryogenic STM, with relatively high Kondo temperature (172&#8197;K), providing evidence for a non&#8208;innocent AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722; species. Further investigation validates that benzene ring fusion and molecule&#8208;substrate interactions play pivotal roles in enhancing Ag(4d(x2&#8722;y2))&#8211;corrole (&#960;) orbital interactions, thereby stabilizing the open&#8208;shell singlet AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722; on Ag(111) surface. Moreover, this strategy used for constructing metal&#8208;free benzene&#8208;ring fused corrole ligand gives rise to inspiration of designing novel metal&#8211;corrole compound for multichannel molecular spintronics devices.

         <title>Reversible Ratiometric NADH Sensing Using Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, rapid analytical method for NADH sensing is achieved by electron transfer from a Pdot to NADH upon UV excitation. Ratiometric NADH detection using DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots exhibits high sensitivity, excellent selectivity versus other analytes, and a fast and reversible response. Smartphone&#8208;based in vivo ratiometric imaging of NADH is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.







Abstract
Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is a key coenzyme in living cells due to its role as an electron carrier in redox reactions, and its concentration is an important indicator of cell metabolic state. Abnormal NADH levels are associated with age&#8208;related metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, creating a demand for a simple, rapid analytical method for point&#8208;of&#8208;care NADH sensing. Here we develop a series of NADH&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) as nanoprobes for NADH measurement, and test their performance in vitro and in vivo. NADH sensing is based on electron transfer from semiconducting polymer chains in the Pdot to NADH upon UV excitation, quenching Pdot fluorescence emission. In polyfluorene&#8208;based Pdots, this mechanism resulted in an on&#8208;off NADH sensor; in DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots, UV excitation resulted in NADH&#8208;sensitive emission at two wavelengths, enabling ratiometric detection. Ratiometric NADH detection using DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots exhibits high sensitivity (3.1&#8197;&#956;M limit of detection), excellent selectivity versus other analytes, reversibility, and a fast response (less than 5&#8197;s). We demonstrate applications of the ratiometric NADH&#8208;sensing Pdots including smartphone&#8208;based NADH imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <title>Endogenous Symbiotic Li3N/Cellulose Skin to Extend the Cycle Life of Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective electrolyte was designed via adding nitrocellulose (NC) in ether electrolyte to form an endogenous symbiotic Li3N/cellulose double solid electrolyte interphase (ES&#8208;DSEI) on Li surface. An ES&#8208;DSEI with a uniform dual&#8208;layer provides excellent chemical and physical stability and high ionic conductivity.







Abstract
Nitrocellulose (NC) is proposed to stabilize the electrolytes for Li metal batteries. The nitro group of NC preferentially reacts with Li metal, and along with the cellulose skeleton is tightly wrapped on the surface, so that the polymer&#8211;inorganic double layer is formed on the Li surface. XPS profile analysis and corroborative cryo&#8208;environmental TEM reveal that the flexible outer layer of the bilayer is a C&#8208;O organic layer, while the dense inner layer is mainly composed of crystalline lithium oxide, lithium oxynitride, and lithium nitride. The Li deposition process was observed via in situ optical microscopy, which indicated that the NC&#8208;derived bilayer facilitates the uniform deposition of Li ions and inhibits the growth of dendrites. After the introduction of NC into the electrolyte, the cycle life of the Li battery is twice than that of the Li battery without NC at 1.0 and 3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Nanoparticles with Programable Intermolecular Charge Transfer for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CT NPs) with programmable absorption can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II regions via donor and acceptor engineering. CT NPs with red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040&#8197;nm achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm excitation, and thus effectively kill both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Extensive recent efforts have been put on the design of high&#8208;performance organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs), especially over NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;window (1000&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). So far, the development is mainly limited by the rarity of molecules with good NIR&#8208;II response.

&lt;p&gt;Organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CT NPs) with programmable absorption can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II regions via donor and acceptor engineering. CT NPs with red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040&#8197;nm achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm excitation, and thus effectively kill both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive recent efforts have been put on the design of high&#8208;performance organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs), especially over NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;window (1000&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). So far, the development is mainly limited by the rarity of molecules with good NIR&#8208;II response. Here, we report organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs) with easily programmable optical absorption. By employing different common donor and acceptor molecules to form CTC nanoparticles (CT NPs), absorption peaks of CT NPs can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region.

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Cell&#8211;Matrix and Cell&#8211;Cell Junctions by Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thickness of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) layer can be modulated by rationally regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or co&#8208;reactant to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions, thus allowing the spatially selective ECL imaging of cell&#8211;matrix adhesions at the bottom and cell&#8211;cell junctions near the apical surface of cells.







Abstract
Cell junctions are protein structures located at specific cell membrane domains that determine key processes in multicellular development. Here we report spatially selective imaging of cell junctions by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or co&#8208;reactant, the thickness of ECL layer can be controlled to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions. At a low concentration of luminophore, ECL generation is confined to the electrode surface, thus revealing only cell&#8211;matrix adhesions at the bottom of cells. While at a high concentration of luminophore, the ECL layer can be remarkably extended by decreasing the co&#8208;reactant concentration, thus allowing the sequential imaging of cell&#8211;matrix and cell&#8211;cell junctions at the bottom and near the apical surface of cells, respectively. This strategy not only provides new insights into the ECL mechanisms but also promises wide applications of ECL microscopy in bioimaging.

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Total Synthesis of C&#8208;11 Oxygenated Cephalotaxus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collective asymmetric total synthesis of C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids was accomplished. This synthesis features sequential chirality transfer steps such as a diastereoselective N&#8208;alkylation, a stereospecific Stevens rearrangement and an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. A series of oxidation state adjustments from a common intermediate led to the asymmetric total synthesis of six C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids.







Abstract
While numerous studies pertaining to the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus alkaloids have been reported, only two strategies have been reported to date for the successful synthesis of the C&#8208;11 oxygenated subset, due to the additional synthetic challenge posed by the remote C&#8208;11 stereocenter. Herein, we report the collective asymmetric total synthesis of C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids using a chiral proline both as a starting material and as the only chirality source. A tetracyclic advanced intermediate was synthesized in a highly stereoselective manner from l&#8208;proline in 8 steps involving sequential chirality transfer steps such as a diastereoselective N&#8208;alkylation, stereospecific Stevens rearrangement and intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction via an unusual O&#8208;acyloxocarbenium intermediate. From a common intermediate, the asymmetric total synthesis of six C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids was completed by a series of oxidation state adjustments.

         <title>Structure Sensitivity of Au&#8208;TiO2 Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on the Au NP size and the TiO2 facet. Supported Au NPs with a size of ca. 5&#8197;nm are more facile to undergo the Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI than those of ca. 2&#8197;nm, and the TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than the TiO2{101} facets.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate that the Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on both Au nanoparticle (NP) sizes and TiO2 facets. Au NPs of ca. 5&#8197;nm are more facile undergo Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI than those of ca. 2&#8197;nm, while TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than TiO2{101} facets. The resulting capsulating TiO2&#8722;x overlayers on Au NPs exhibit an average oxidation state between +3 and +4 and a Au&#8208;to&#8208;TiO2&#8722;x charge transfer, which, combined with calculations, determines the Ti:O ratio as ca. 6:11. Both TiO2&#8722;x overlayers and TiO2&#8722;x&#8208;Au interface exhibit easier lattice oxygen activation and higher intrinsic activity in catalyzing low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation than the starting Au&#8208;TiO2 interface. These results advance fundamental understanding of SMSI and demonstrate engineering of metal NP size and oxide facet as an effective strategy to tune the SMSI for efficient catalysis.

         <title>Controlling Oxygen Reduction Selectivity through Steric Effects: Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron and Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction with Cobalt Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt porphyrin atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects were synthesized. One isomer is selective for the 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, one is selective for the 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, while the other two show poor selectivity for either 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Achieving a selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical but challenging. Herein, we report controlling ORR selectivity of Co porphyrins by tuning only steric effects. We designed Co porphyrin 1 with meso&#8208;phenyls each bearing a bulky ortho&#8208;amido group. Due to the resulted steric hinderance, 1 has four atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. Isomers &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; catalyze ORR with n=2.10 and 3.75 (n is the electron number transferred per O2), respectively, but &#945;&#945;&#946;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#946; show poor selectivity with n=2.89&#8211;3.10. Isomer &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; catalyzes 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by preventing a bimolecular O2 activation path, while &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; improves 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR selectivity by improving O2 binding at its pocket, a feature confirmed by spectroscopy methods, including O K&#8208;edge near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. This work represents an unparalleled example to improve 2&#8201;e&#8722; and 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by tuning only steric effects without changing molecular and electronic structures.

Isomer &lt;b&gt;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;&lt;/b&gt; catalyzes 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR by preventing a bimolecular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation path, while &lt;b&gt;&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;&lt;/b&gt; improves 4&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity by improving O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding at its pocket, a feature confirmed by spectroscopy methods, including O K&#8208;edge near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. This work represents an unparalleled example to improve 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and 4&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR by tuning only steric effects without changing molecular and electronic structures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Oligonucleotide Bioconjugation with Bifunctional Palladium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linking life's molecules: Rapid and site&#8208;selective oligonucleotide bioconjugation via bifunctional oxidative addition complexes (OACs) is reported. These bifunctional OACs react chemoselectively with amine&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to generate isolable oligonucleotide OACs. Within minutes, the oligonucleotide OACs undergo a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;S arylation reaction with a broad range of native thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules.







Abstract
Organometallic reagents enable practical strategies for bioconjugation. Innovations in the design of water&#8208;soluble ligands and the enhancement of reaction rates have allowed for chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling reactions of peptides and proteins to be carried out in water. There are currently no organometallic&#8208;based methods for oligonucleotide bioconjugation to other biomolecules. Here we report bifunctional palladium(II)&#8208;oxidative addition complexes (OACs) as reagents for high&#8208;yielding oligonucleotide bioconjugation reactions. These bifunctional OACs react chemoselectively with amine&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to generate the first isolable, bench stable oligonucleotide&#8208;palladium(II) OACs. These complexes undergo site&#8208;selective C&#8208;S arylation with a broad range of native thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules at low micromolar concentrations in under one hour. This approach provided oligonucleotide&#8208;peptide, oligonucleotide&#8208;protein, oligonucleotide&#8208;small molecule, and oligonucleotide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates in &gt;80&#8201;% yield and afforded conjugation of multiple copies of oligonucleotides onto a monoclonal antibody.

         <title>What Shall We Do with the Computed Detonation Performance? Comment on &#8220;1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Bridges: A Strategy to Improve Energetics at the Molecular Level&#8221;</title>

Abstract
In this Correspondence, a question is raised on how confident are the computed detonation performance values. Consideration of the energetic materials in a recent Research Article in this journal and some other newly synthesized promising compounds shows that the variation between the available methods of calculation is surprisingly high.
