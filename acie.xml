      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Layers Hierarchically Integrate Three Synergistic Active Sites for Tandem Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A tri&#8208;functional metal&#8211;organic layer with [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizers and Hf12 secondary building units capped with triflate groups as strong Lewis acid sites and PPA&#8208;Co groups as hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalysts synergistically catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes, respectively.







Abstract
We report the design of a bifunctional metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL), Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co, composed of [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ [DBB&#8208;Ru, DBB=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;benzoato)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] connecting ligand as a photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(PPA)Cl (PPA&#8208;Co, dmgH=dimethylglyoxime; PPA=4&#8208;pyridinepropionic acid) on the Hf12 secondary building unit (SBU) as a hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalyst. Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co efficiently catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of indolines and tetrahydroquinolines to afford indoles and quinolones. We extended this strategy to prepare Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf MOL with a [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizer and Hf12 SBU capped with triflate as strong Lewis acids and PPA&#8208;Co as a hydrogen transfer catalyst. With three synergistic active sites, Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf competently catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes with turnover numbers of up to 500 and 460, respectively, illustrating the potential use of MOLs in constructing novel multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts.

      <title>Towards the circular economy: converting aromatic plastic waste back to arenes over Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The upgrading of plastic waste is one of the grand challenges for the 21  st  century owing to its disruptive impact on environment. Here, we show the first example of the catalytic conversion of various aromatic plastic wastes with C&#8211;O and/or C&#8211;C linkages to arenes (75&#8208;85% yield)&#160; via catalytic hydrogenolysis over Ru/Nb  2  O  5&#160;  catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single&#8208;component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique features including: (1) the small sized Ru clusters on Nb  2  O  5&#160;  , which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2) the strong oxygen affinity of NbO  x  species for C&#8211;O bond activation and Br&#248;nsted acid sites for C&#8211;C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unimolecular Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysts for Selective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides</title>
      <dc:description>Anion&#8208;binding can regulate anion transport in chloride channels via dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions, which gives insights into the designing of new organocatalytic transformations, but is surprisingly unexplored in polymerization catalysis. Herein, we describe an effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis where 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs), which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high molecular weight (MW) stereoregular polyesters. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of PheOCA (OCA from phenylalanine) mediated by unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalyst generates highly isotactic poly(phenyllactic acid) (Ph&#8208;PLA) with MW up to 150.0 kDa. Specifically, high MW Ph&#8208;PLA exhibits 30&#8208;fold increase in the elongation at break in comparison to its low MW congener. Moreover, active species of the polymerization are moisture&#8208;tolerant and can be conducted in unpurified solvent, facilitating facile synthesis of high MW stereoregular polyesters with pendant functional groups.  Calculations and experiment studies indicate a dynamic cooperative anion&#8208;binding mechanism where the dynamic anion&#8208;binding interaction of thiourea moiety to propagating species facilitates efficient chain propagation and the synergetic decarboxylation retains high selectivity for OCA ring&#8208;opening over side reactions (e.g., cyclization, epimerization and transesterification).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Self&#8208;reporting, fluorescence methods for monitoring&#160; folding and aggregation of proteins have a long history in biochemistry. Placing orthogonal luminophores within individual synthetic polymer chains for self&#8208;reporting both folding (i.e., its intra&#8208;molecular compaction to isolated single&#8208;chain nanoparticles, SCNPs) and unbidden aggregation (i.e., the inter&#8208;molecular association of SCNPs) remains as a great challenge.

      <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with systems that operate out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.</dc:description>

Meanwhile, the controlled released drugs are used for chemotherapy, while under the laser irradiation the loaded photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy.

      <title>TBD&#8208;Enhanced Activity of Peroxide Intermediates in Phosphine&#8208;Free &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>The critical role of double hydrogen bonds was addressed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones catalyzed by 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD), in absence of either metal catalyst or phosphine reductant. Experimental and theoretical investigations were carried out to study the mechanism. In addition to initiating the reaction by proton abstraction, a more important role of TBD was revealed to enhance the oxidizing ability of peroxide intermediates, allowing DMSO an efficient substitute of commonly used phosphine reductants. Further characterizations with the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) confirmed the double hydrogen bonds between TBD and ketone, and kinetic studies suggested the attack of dioxygen on the TBD&#8208;enol adduct to be the rate&#8208;determining step. This work uncovered the enhancing role of TBD on the oxidizing ability of peroxides, and should encourage the application of TBD as a catalyst for oxidations.</dc:description>

      <title>Adaptive Chirality of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework for Chirality Induction in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral framework materials have been developed for many applications including chiral recognition, chiral separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical materials. Herein, we report that an achiral cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (  SOF&#8208;1  ) with the dynamic rotational conformation of tetraphenylethene units can exhibit adaptive chirality to produce  M  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  or  P  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  with mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism (CD) with g  abs  &#8776; &#177;10  &#8722;4  and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with g  lum  &#8776; &#177;10  &#8722;4  induced by  L&#8208;/D&#8208;  phenylalanine in water, respectively. The chirality induction in CD (g  abs  &#8776; &#8722;10  &#8208;4  ) and CPL (g  lum  &#8776; &#8722;10  &#8722;4  ) of  P  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  from achiral  SOF&#8208;1  can be presented using a small amount of adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate disodium (ATP) or adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate disodium (ADP) (only 0.4 equiv) in water. Furthermore, the adaptive chirality of  SOF&#8208;1  can be used to determine dipeptide sequences (e.g., Phe&#8208;Ala and Ala&#8208;Phe) and distinguish polypeptides/proteins (e.g., somatostatin and human insulin) with characteristic CD spectra. Therefore, achiral  SOF&#8208;1  as an ideal chiroptical platform with adaptive chirality may be applied to determine the enantiopurity of amino acids (e.g.,  L&#8208;/D&#8208;  phenylalanine), develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish biological chiral macromolecules (e.g., peptides/proteins) via chirality induction in water.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers are promising materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as they minimize detrimental faradaic side&#8208;reactions during OECT operation, yet their steady&#8208;state OECT performance still lags far behind their all&#8208;donor counterparts. Here, we report three D&#8208;A polymers based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit that afford OECT performances similar to those of all&#8208;donor polymers, hence representing a significant improvement to the previously developed D&#8208;A copolymers. In addition to improved OECT performance, DFT simulations of the polymers and their respective hole polarons also revealed a positive correlation between hole polaron delocalization and steady&#8208;state OECT performance, providing new insights into the design of OECT materials. More importantly, we demonstrate how polaron delocalization can be tuned directly at the molecular level by selection of the building blocks comprising the polymers&#8217; conjugated backbone, thus paving the way for the development of even higher performing OECT polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#160;Light&#8208;Driven Shape&#8208;Morphing of Programmable Anisotropic Hydrogels Enabled by MXene Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic materials, that are soft, photoresponsive, programmable and capable of versatile shape&#8208;morphing, have become an emerging paradigm for the development of next&#8208;generation smart robots with wireless controllability and biomimetic functions. Herein, we report near&#8208;infrared (NIR)  light&#8208;driven shape&#8208;morphing of programmable MXene&#8208;containing anisotropic hydrogel actuators that are fabricated through  in situ  free&#8208;radical copolymerization of a judiciously designed MXene nanomonomer with thermosensitive hydrogel network.  A low electric field (few V mm  &#8208;1  ) was found to enable a spatial distribution of MXene nanosheets and hence introduce the anisotropy into the hydrogel network. Programmable anisotropic hydrogel actuators were developed by controlling ITO electrode pattern, direct&#8208;current (DC) electric field direction and mask&#8208;assisted photopolymerization.  As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept,  we demonstrate NIR light&#8208;driven shape morphing of the MXene&#8208;containing anisotropic hydrogel into various shapes and devise a four&#8208;arm soft gripper that can perform distinct photomechanical functions such as grasping, lifting/lowering down and releasing an object upon sequential NIR light exposure. The proposed strategy would provide impetus into the development of programmable and reconfigurable smart actuators that can find promising applications in diverse areas such as soft robotics or machines, biomedical devices and beyond.</dc:description>

Intravenously injected microglia platform showed anticipated anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization at stroke site with insonation control and accelerated the M2&#8208;type polarization of endogenous microglia for long&#8208;tern stroke recovery.

      <dc:description>
A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives. The product polymers change color, become fluorescent, and exhibit changes to their physical properties, such as solubility, depending on the functionality that is appended.







Abstract
A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.

      <title>Atomically precise preorganization of open metal sites on gold nanocluster with high catalytic performance</title>

Single crystal structural determination reveals that Au 23  has eight uncoordinated gold atoms in the shape of a distorted bicapped triangular prism. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Furthermore, this cluster has excellent performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.

      <title>Behaviour of novel smart surfactants in stabilizing pH&#8208;responsive emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Newly structured pH&#8208;responsive smart surfactants (abbreviated as N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N, n=14, 16) were synthesized by connecting a tertiary amine group at the end of the hydrophobic chain in alkyl trimethylammonium bromides. In neutral and alkaline media, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N behaves as a normal cationic surfactant and can stabilize conventional emulsions alone, as well as Pickering emulsions and novel oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions together with oppositely and similarly charged nanoparticles, respectively. In acidic media however, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N is turned to a strongly hydrophilic Bola type surfactant N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;NH  +  due to formation of the amine salt, which is an inferior emulsifier either when used alone or together with charged nanoparticles resulting in demulsification. Specifically, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;NH  +  returns to the aqueous phase alone or together with nanoparticles after demulsification without contaminating the oil phase, and the whole aqueous phase can be recycled many times triggered by pH. We thus offer a new protocol towards designing and synthesizing newly structured and recyclable smart surfactants, and specifically make it a green process to prepare various temporarily stable emulsions which are often applied in emulsion polymerization, heterogeneous catalysis and oil transportation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The hydrolysis of earth&#8208;abundant Al(III) has implications in mineral mimicry, geochemistry and environmental chemistry. The design and synthesis of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are important in modern chemistry due to their extensively optical applications. To study the hydrolysis and NLO properties, herein the assembly of Al(III) ions with &#960; conjugated carboxylate ligands were carried out.

Thanks to the accurate X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, the boundary hydrolysis snapshots that occur at equatorial unsaturated coordination sites of Al(III) ions are discovered. The charge distribution analysis and theoretical DFT calculations further supported proposed boundary substitution idea. Z&#8208;scan experiment results showed that the Al32&#8208;oxo clusters possess significant reverse saturable absorption (RSA) response with the minimal normalized transmittance up to 29%, indicating they are suitable candidates for optical limiting (OL) materials.

      <title>The Characteristics of Disulfide&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>The disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds in the three different model systems of diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  O/H 2  CO/HCONH 2  clusters were characterized by high&#8208;resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed, and are characterized by one of the three different S&#8722;S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C/N/O disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and two O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  O/HCONH 2  clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved in non&#8208;covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.</dc:description>

The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed, and are characterized by one of the three different S&#8722;S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C/N/O disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and two O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  O/HCONH 2  clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved in non&#8208;covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrochemical Polymerization Provides a Function&#8208;Integrated System for Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Water oxidation (2H  2  O &#8594; O  2  + 4H  +  + 4e  &#8722;  ) is a key reaction for obtaining the&#160;protons and electrons required to produce chemical energy from abundant source. In&#160;nature, the reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based catalyst, so&#8208;called&#160;the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). In the OEC, several amino acid residues&#160;surrounding the catalytic center act as hole transporter, and greatly contribute for&#160;promoting the efficiency of the reaction. In other words, the catalytic center surrounded&#160;by hole transporters is essential to achieve efficient water oxidation. However, in the&#160;artificial systems, there is no example of the water oxidation system which has a&#160;catalytic center surrounded by hole transporters. Here, we present a facile strategy to&#160;integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters into one system. Electrochemical&#160;polymerization of a tetranuclear cobalt cubane complex with carbazole moieties&#160;afforded the polymer&#8208;based material (  Poly&#8208;1  ) with hole&#8208;transporting biscabazole&#160;moieties. Poly&#8208;1 was confirmed to exhibit excellent hole&#8208;transporting ability and&#160;catalyze water oxidation with high faradaic efficiency and a low overpotential. Control&#160;experiments revealed that the catalytic activity was almost suppressed in the absence&#160;of biscarbazole moiety, which indicates the importance of the integration of catalytic&#160;center and hole transporters. The present study provides a novel strategy for

constructing efficient molecule&#8208;based systems for water oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>A Dual Role Reductase from Phytosterols Catabolism Enables the Efficient Production of Valuable Steroid Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>4&#8208;androstenedione (4&#8208;AD) and progesterone (PG) are two of the most important precursors for synthesis of steroid drugs, however their current manufacturing processes suffer from low efficiency and severe environmental issues.

Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR in the  Mycobacterium neoaurum  can achieve exclusive production of either 4&#8208;AD or 4&#8208;HBC from phytosterols. By utilizing a two&#8208;step synthesis, 4&#8208;HBC can be efficiently converted to PG in a scalable manner (100 gram scale).

      <dc:description>In this study, we describe the engineering of sub&#8208;100 nm nanomicelles (DTX&#8208;PC NMs) derived from phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel (DTX)&#8208;conjugated lithocholic acid (DTX&#8208;PC) and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;tethered lithocholic acid.

Unlike DTX&#8208;TS, DTX&#8208;PC NMs do not cause any systemic toxicity and slow the decay rate of plasma DTX concentration in rodents and non&#8208;rodent species including non&#8208;human primates. We further demonstrate that DTX&#8208;PC NMs target demethylation of CpG islands of Sparcl1 (a tumor suppressor gene) by suppressing DNA methyltransferase activity, and increase the expression of Sparcl1 that leads to tumor regression. Therefore, this unique system has the potential to improve the quality of life in cancer patients, and can be translated as a next&#8208;generation chemotherapeutic.</dc:description>

The critical photoelectronic properties of target QDs, including bandgap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states, can be conveniently tailored.

      <title>Masked Alkyne Equivalents for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Polyynes</title>
      <dc:description>Polyyne polyrotaxanes, encapsulated cyclocarbon catenanes and other fascinating mechanically interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures should become accessible if masked alkyne equivalents (MAEs) can be developed that are large enough to prevent unthreading of a macrocycle, and that can be cleanly unmasked under mild conditions. Here we report the synthesis of a new bulky MAE based on  t&#8208;  butylbicyclo[4.3.1]decatriene. This MAE was used to synthesize a polyyne [2]rotaxane and a masked&#8208;polyyne [3]rotaxane by Cadiot&#8208;Chodkiewicz coupling. Glaser cyclo&#8208;oligomerization of the [2]rotaxane gave masked cyclocarbon catenanes. The unmasking behavior of the catenanes and rotaxanes was tested by photolysis at a range of UV wavelengths. Photochemical unmasking did not proceed cleanly enough to prepare extended encapsulated polyyne polyrotaxanes. We highlight the scope and challenges involved with this approach to interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures.</dc:description>

      <title>Seven&#8208;step Synthesis of All&#8208;nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi&#8208;amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

      <title>Mixed Group 14&#8208;15 Metalates As Model Compounds For Doped Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>Doping and alloying are valuable tools for modifying and enhancing the properties and performance of lead halide perovskites. However, the effects of heterovalent doping with Sb  3+  and Bi  3+  cations are still a matter of current investigation. Due to the different charge of the dopants compared to the constituting Pb  2+  ions, a simultaneous creation of defects is unavoidable and the influence of these defects and the actual metal substitution become entangled. Here, we present the first 14&#8208;15 iodido metalates, (BED)  4  PbE  2  I  16  (BED&#160;=&#160;  N  &#8208;benzylethylenediammonium; E = Sb (  1  ), Bi (  2  )), which are model compounds for doped lead iodide perovskites and display surprisingly low bandgaps of 2.01 (  1  ) and 1.88 eV (  2  ). Quantum chemical investigations show that this stems from a good electronic match between the PbI  6  and EI  6  units of the compounds. Our results provide a model system for doped perovskites, but also represent the first examples of a promising new class of metal halide materials.</dc:description>

Specifically, the pyridinic N is dominant with a maximum percent of 48.7 %. By using I  3  &#8208;  reduction as a demo, the resultant NCM&#8208;5 exhibits the best activity with a power conversion efficiency of 8.77 %. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated a pyridinic N site&#8208;dependent activity that the amount of active sites increases with the increase of pyridinic N, and the carbon atom adjacent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinic N at the armchair edge acts as the most favorable site for the adsorption of I  2  molecule.</dc:description>

It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated a pyridinic N site&#8208;dependent activity that the amount of active sites increases with the increase of pyridinic N, and the carbon atom adjacent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinic N at the armchair edge acts as the most favorable site for the adsorption of I  2  molecule.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Superseding &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato Ligands: An Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Imine Ligand Stabilizes the Exhaustive Series of B=X Boranes (X = O, S, Se, Te)</title>
      <dc:description>While the C=X bond (X = O, S, Se, Te) in ketones and their heavier chalcogen analogues is an established structural entity, carbon&#180;s neighbor element boron reluctantly forms the respective B=X moieties, which has stimulated the quest for such species in the past few years. Based on the partial success achieved in this area by means of the N,N&#180;&#8208;chelating &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand (HNacNac), we present a new amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm), which gives rise to the isolation of an exhaustive series of Lewis acid free, monomeric chalcogeno B=X boranes with documented &#960;&#8208;bond character between boron and the chalcogen. The chalcogenobo&#8208;ranes are isoelectronic and isolobal the respective ketones. The chemical behavior of the oxoborane (B=O) strongly resembles the classical carbonyl reactivity in C=O bonds as demonstrated by four typical textbook examples including imine and ketal formation. The improved stability provided by the HAmIm ligand system arises (i) from the formation of more stable five&#8208;membered boron chelates vs. the six&#8208;membered NacNac analogues and (ii) from the incorporation of an imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine moiety providing enhanced &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donation. We, therefore, propose that the new HAmIm ligand class may supersede the widely employed NacNac system in certain applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow battery is a promising electrochemical technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Here we report a biomimetic, ultra&#8208;stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP).

Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6&#8208;AFPs possess ultra&#8208;high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states.

      <dc:description>Ferroelectric materials, equipping a striking bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), have shown great potential for the next generation photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. However, further applications of conventional ferroelectric materials are hindered by their poor performance. The family of hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics combining fascinating polarization and striking semiconducting properties presents significant possibilities.

      <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well&#8208;known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50&#8208;70 vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the &#960;&#8208;surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Enzymatic esterification reactions under aqueous conditions are not common, as most of the well&#8208;known enzymes catalyzing esterification require the minimization of water or activated substrates for activity.&#160;This work reports a new reaction catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR),&#160;an enzyme known to transform a broad spectrum of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, with the use of ATP, Mg  2+  , and NADPH as co&#8208;substrates.

      <dc:description>Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. In this work, we develop a new bio&#8208;palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy for in&#8208;situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization reaction, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell&#8208;generated bio&#8208;Pd catalyst. The in&#8208;situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light&#8208;harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. Moreover, it can augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. By using this bio&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be in&#8208;situ synthesized on the living cell surface, which paves a new way for modulating cell functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Discrete Metal&#8208;Organic Cages into Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly (HAS) is a powerful approach to create supramolecular nanostructures for biomedical applications. This potency, however, is generally challenged by the difficulty of controlling the HAS of biomacromolecules and the functionality of resulted HAS nanostructures. Herein, we report a modular approach for controlling the HAS of discrete metal&#8208;organic cages (MOC) into supramolecular nanoparticles, and its potential for intracellular protein delivery and cell&#8208;fate specification. We demonstrate that the hierarchical coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of adamantane&#8208;functionalized M  12  L  24  MOC (Ada&#8208;MOC), and the host&#8208;guest interaction of Ada&#8208;MOC with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) afford supramolecular nanoparticles in a controllable manner. Importantly, the HAS maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling the encapsulation of protein into the nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The strategy of designing the HAS of MOC could be easily extended to other metallosupramolecules to create soft&#8208;matter nanostructures for advanced biomedical applications.</dc:description>

We demonstrate that the hierarchical coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of adamantane&#8208;functionalized M  12  L  24  MOC (Ada&#8208;MOC), and the host&#8208;guest interaction of Ada&#8208;MOC with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) afford supramolecular nanoparticles in a controllable manner. Importantly, the HAS maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling the encapsulation of protein into the nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The strategy of designing the HAS of MOC could be easily extended to other metallosupramolecules to create soft&#8208;matter nanostructures for advanced biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Docking of Cu(I) and Ag(I) in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Adsorption and Separation of Xenon</title>
      <dc:description>We present a metal docking strategy utilizing the precise spatial arrangement of organic struts as metal chelating sites in a MOF. Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8208;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units in MOF&#8208;303 [Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)] were used to chelate Cu(I) and Ag(I) with atomic precision and yield the metalated Cu&#8208; and Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 compounds [(CuCl)0.50&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2) and (AgNO3)0.49&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)]. The coordination geometries of Cu(I) and Ag(I) were examined using 3D electron diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy techniques. The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus allowing for binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity. In particular, Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 exhibited Xe uptake of 59 cm3 cm&#8208;3 at 298 K and 0.2 bar with a selectivity of 10.4, placing it among the highest performing MOFs. It also gave up to 100% improvement of the dynamic separation performance in comparison to pristine MOF&#8208;303. This metalation strategy represents a new strategy for engineering MOFs to give high&#8208;performance gas separations.</dc:description>

      <title>Activating lattice oxygen at twisted surface in mesoporous CeO2 single crystal for efficient and durable catalytic CO oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Activating lattice oxygen linked to active sites at surface remains a fundamental challenge in many catalytic reactions. Here we create well&#8208;defined surface by directly growing porous CeO2 single crystals at 2 cm scale and confining Pt in lattice to construct isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at continuously&#8208;twisted surface in a monolith. We demonstrate significantly enhanced activation of lattice oxygen linked to Pt ions in contrast to Ce ions in local structures. We show complete CO oxidation with air at 67 &#176;C without degradation being observed after operation of 300 hours. The isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at twisted surfaces not only contribute to the chemisorption of CO but also effectively activate the lattice oxygen linked to Pt ion for CO oxidation. The current work would open a new route to activate lattice oxygen by incorporating well&#8208;defined active structures confined at the surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Inhibition of urease, a Ni&#8208;enzyme: the reactivity of a key thiol with mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted catechols elucidated by kinetic, structural and theoretical studies</title>
      <dc:description>Urease is a Ni(II)&#8208;containing enzyme able to catalyse the conversion of urea to ammonia and carbamate. Urea, the most used soil nitrogen fertiliser worldwide, is thus rapidly hydrolysed into species of nitrogen that can be taken up by plants, a function that, while essential, might also significantly decrease the efficiency of this process due to the release of gaseous species of nitrogen into the atmosphere, contributing to the green&#8208;house effect and to air pollution. Moreover, urease is also a virulence factor for ureolytic bacterial human pathogens that affect the health and livelihood of millions of people, especially, but not only, in developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America. For these reasons, strategies for the efficient inhibition of urease activity by molecules that interact with the enzyme and counterbalance its negative effects must be pursued. Here, the inhibition of urease from  Sporosarcina pasteurii  (SPU) and  Canavalia ensiformis  (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly&#8208;hydroxylated molecules, namely mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU&#8208;inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.</dc:description>

      <title>Polymorphism of 2D Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

      <title>Charge&#8208;promoted self&#8208;metalation of porphyrins on an oxide surface</title>
      <dc:description>Metalation and self&#8208;metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self&#8208;metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;porphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;coordinative binding of O2 at the active center of a copper&#8208;dependent enzyme</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is abundant, it is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground&#8208;state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one&#8208;electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal&#8208;oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Pd0&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Arylation for the Synthesis of Chiral Warped Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>C&#8211;H activation&#8208;based ring&#8208;forming methods constitute a powerful approach for the construction of complex molecular architectures, especially those containing a congested stereocenter. Therefore, this strategy seems perfectly suited to address the synthesis of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, which are important target molecules in the field of organic electronic materials. Herein, we describe an&#160;  enantioselective Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C(sp  2  )&#8211;H arylation protocol for the synthesis of chiral fluoradenes and other warped molecules  , which could serve to the bottom&#8208;up construction of chiral PAHs. The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity. The chiroptical properties of the obtained products were investigated, and some of them were found to have a strong ellipticity and an emission band located in the visible region.</dc:description>
