         <title>High Throughput Multidimensional Kinetic Screening in Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An automated high throughput multidimensional reaction screening platform based on an inline Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR) is presented. By combining flow chemistry, machine automation and inline analysis, the platform is able to screen reactions in multidimensions (residence time, monomer concentration, degree of polymerization, reaction temperature and monomer conversion) rapidly and efficiently way. Kinetic data libraries associated with high data precision (absolute error &lt; 4 %), high reproducibility and high data density are built with ease from the platform. To test the method, we screened the RAFT polymerization of methyl acrylate in unmatched detail, and the ring opening metathesis polymerization of methyl&#8208;5&#8208;norbornene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate. The method we introduce is a key step in providing &#8216;big data&#8217; for data driven research in the future, and already at present allows for precise prediction of reaction outcomes within the high&#8208;dimensional chemical parameter space that is screened.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis at High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Correlates with its Composition&#8208;Dependent Potential of Zero Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast possibilities in the elemental combinations of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) make it essential to discover activity descriptors for establishing rational electrocatalyst design principles. Despite the increasing attention on the potential of zero charge (PZC) of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, neither the PZC of HEAs nor the impact of the PZC on the HER activity at HEAs has been des&#173;cribed.   Here, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) to determine the PZC and the HER activities of various elemental compositions of a Pt&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ir&#8208;Ag thin&#8208;film HEA materials library (HEA&#8208;ML) with high statis&#173;tical reliability. Interestingly, the PZC of Pt&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ir&#8208;Ag is linearly correlated with its composition&#8208;weighted average work function. The HER current density in acidic media positively correlates with the PZC, which can be explained by the preconcentration of H+ in the electrical double layer at potentials negative of the PZC.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Amplification of Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Nucleotide&#8208;Templated Supramolecular Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from purely organic molecules holds great promise for applications in displays, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high dissymmetry values (glum) from organic chromophores remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a bioinspired approach using adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;triggered supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene diimide&#8208;derived monomer (ANSG) to induce CPL with a remarkable glum value of 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2. The ANSG molecules undergo a templated, chiral self&#8208;assembly through a cooperative growth mechanism in the presence of ATP, resulting in scrolled nanotubes with aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) and induced CPL. Furthermore, we demonstrate the concept of chiroptical amplification of induced CPL by efficiently amplifying asymmetry using a mixture of chiral ATP and achiral pyrophosphate. This innovative approach opens numerous opportunities in the emerging field of circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling New Approaches:&#160;Recent Advances in Processing Aliphatic Polycarbonate&#8208;Based Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polycarbonates (aPCs) have become increasingly popular as functional materials due to their biocompatibility and capacity for on&#8208;demand degradation. Advances in polymerization techniques and the introduction of new functional monomers have expanded the library of aPCs available, offering a diverse range of chemical compositions and structures. To accommodate the emerging requirements of new applications in biomedical and energy&#8208;related fields, various manufacturing techniques have been adopted for processing aPC&#8208;based materials. However, a summary of these techniques has yet to be conducted. The aim of this paper is to enrich the toolbox available to researchers, enabling them to select the most suitable technique for their materials. In this paper, a concise review of the recent progress in processing techniques, including controlled self&#8208;assembly, electrospinning, additive manufacturing, and other techniques, is presented. We also highlight the specific challenges and opportunities for the sustainable growth of this research area and the successful integration of aPCs in industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>H2&#8208;free Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Butadiene by the Atomic Sieving Effect of Pd Membrane with Tree&#8208;like Pd Dendrites Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2&#8208;free semi&#8208;hydrogenation at room temperature shows great advantage for replacing the thermocatalytic process in industry owing to the high energy and resource saving, however, remains great challenges. Herein, a tree&#8208;like Pd dendrites array decorated Pd membrane was constructed as the core device in an electrochemistry assisted gas&#8208;fed membrane reactor for butadiene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. It reveals that hydrogen atomic sieving effect of this Pd&#8208;based membrane under electrochemical condition was the key for semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The configuration study of Pd nanostructured membrane demonstrates that the penetration of hydrogen atoms through Pd membrane from electrochemical side to chemical side is affected by the consumption of hydrogen atom in semi&#8208;hydrogenation step. Such atomic sieving property of nanostructured Pd membrane with 5.1 times increase in catalytic active surface area brings above 14 times higher in butadiene conversion than that of bare Pd foil, with ~90% of butenes selectivity at butadiene conversion ~98% over 300h of H2&#8208;free reaction under 15 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Trifluoromethylketones from Alkyl Bromides and Trifluoroacetic Anhydride by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones are a type of unique fluorine&#8208;containing subunit which plays a significant role in altering the physical and biological properties of molecules. However, catalytic methods to provide direct access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones is highly desirable yet remains underdeveloped, partially due to the high reactivity and instability of trifluoroacetyl radical. Herein, we report a photocatalytic synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones from alkyl bromides with trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction features a dual catalysis of visible&#8208;light and XAT reaction, followed by an enabling radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl radical with a stabilized trifluoromethyl radical. The reaction provides the first straightforward access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones from easily&#8208;available and cost&#8208;effective alkyl halides and TFAA.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ultrathin Inorganic Molecular Crystal Interfacial Layer for Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal anode suffers from dendrite growth and side reactions during cycling, significantly deteriorating the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra&#8208;flat Sb2O3 molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in&#8208;situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10nm Sb2O3 thin layer could ensure uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO3 layer undergoes an uncontrolled up&#8208;layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic&#8208;blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb2O3 layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72 h to 2800 h, in contrast to the 900 h of much thicker WO3 even in 100 nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.</dc:description>

Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra-flat Sb2O3 molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in-situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10nm Sb2O3 thin layer could ensure uniform under-layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO3 layer undergoes an uncontrolled up-layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic-blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb2O3 layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72 h to 2800 h, in contrast to the 900 h of much thicker WO3 even in 100 nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Inhibition of Ice Growth by Biomimetic Crowding Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The freezing of biological fluids is intensively studied but remains elusive as it is affected not only by the various components but also by the crowding nature of the biological fluids. Herein, we constructed spherical crowders, fibrous crowders, and coacervates by various components ranging from surfactants to polymer and proteins to mimic three typical crowders in biological fluids, i.e., globular proteins, fibrous networks, and condensates of biomolecules. It is elucidated that the three crowders exhibit low, moderate, and strong ice growth inhibition activity, respectively, resulting from their different abilities in slowing down water dynamics. Intriguingly, the coacervate consisting of molecules without obvious ice growth inhibition activity strongly inhibits ice growth, which is firstly employed as a highly&#8208;potent cryoprotectant. This work provides new insights into the survival of freezing&#8208;tolerant organisms and opens an avenue for the design of ice&#8208;controlling materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Crossover Sorption of C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4 in Soft Porous Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous sorbents are materials&#160;utilized&#160;for various applications, including storage and separation. Typically, the uptake of a single gas by a sorbent decreases with temperature, but the relative affinity for two similar gases does not change. However, herein, we report a rare example of "crossover sorption," in which the uptake capacity and apparent affinity for two similar gases reverse at different temperatures. We synthesized two&#160;soft porous coordination polymers, [Zn2(L1)(L2/L3)2]n&#160;(PCP&#8208;1/2) (L1 = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl; L2 = 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene; L3 = 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene). These PCPs&#160;exhibits structural changes upon gas sorption and show the crossover sorption for both C2H2/CO2&#160;and C2H6/C2H4, where the apparent affinity reverse with temperature. We used in&#8208;situ gas&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses to reveal the guest&#8208;inclusion structures of PCP&#8208;1 at various temperatures.&#160;Interestingly, we observed three&#8208;step single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations with the different loading phases under these gases, providing insight into guest&#8208;binding positions, nature of host&#8208;guest or guest&#8208;guest interactions. Combining with theoretical investigation, we have fully elucidated the crossover sorption in the flexible coordination networks, which involves a reversal of apparent affinity and uptake of similar gases at different temperatures. We discovered that this behaviour can be explained by the delicate balance between guest binding and host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru Composition Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compositionally complex materials such as high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor&#8208;activity relationship, as experimental screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross&#8208;validated mean absolute error of 0.042 mA/cm2 by applying a theory&#8208;derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high&#8208;entropy materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrodeoxygenation of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Aromatic Plastic Wastes to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the global plastic pollution issues and the challenges of hydrogen storage and transportation, we report a new class of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) system based on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes. We developed a catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2 + HZSM&#8208;5 for direct HDO of polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyphenylene oxide (PPO), and their mixtures to cycloalkanes as LOHCs, with high yield up to 99% under mild reaction conditions. The theoretical hydrogen storage capacity can reach to ~5.74 wt%. The reaction pathway involves depolymerization of PC into C15 aromatics and C15 monophenols by direct hydrogenolysis of the C&#8208;O bond between the benzene ring and ester group, and subsequent parallel hydrogenation of C15 aromatics and HDO of C15 monophenols. HDO of cyclic alcohol is the rate determining step. The active site is Ru metallic nanoparticles with partially covered ReOx species. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of oxophilic ReOx species and Ru metallic sites for C&#8208;O hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation and the promotion effect of HZSM&#8208;5 for dehydration of cyclic alcohol. The highly efficient and stably dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes over Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 confirms that HDO products can act as LOHCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multi&#8208;Functional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1a&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation on the D6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight on the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation triggered double bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl group assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the D7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Of particularly importance is that product distribution is regulated by the interaction with cell membrane. This proposed biosynthetic pathway provides an opportunity to understand the structural diversification mechanisms of melleolides and protoilludane sesquiterpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Design of Unprecedented Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multiple Anion Functionalities and Hierarchical Porosity for Benchmark Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented robust metal organic framework ZNU&#8208;9 with a new wly topology and featuring multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity was reported for simultaneous efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation with both high capacity and high selectivity.







Abstract
Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene (C2H4) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;8) with znv topology and SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;9) with wly topology for efficient capture of C2H2 from CO2 and C2H4. Both ZNU&#8208;8 and ZNU&#8208;9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU&#8208;9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C2H2 capacity (7.94&#8197;mmol/g) and a high C2H2/CO2 (10.3) or C2H2/C2H4 (11.6) selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented robust metal organic framework ZNU-9 with a new wly topology and featuring multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity was reported for simultaneous efficient C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation with both high capacity and high selectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation of acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX-Cu-TPBDA (ZNU-8) with &lt;b&gt;znv&lt;/b&gt; topology and SIFSIX-Cu-TPBDA (ZNU-9) with &lt;b&gt;wly&lt;/b&gt; topology for efficient capture of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Both ZNU-8 and ZNU-9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU-9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity (7.94&#8197;mmol/g) and a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (10.3) or C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (11.6) selectivity. The calculated capacity of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per anion (4.94&#8197;mol/mol at 1&#8197;bar) is the highest among all the anion pillared metal organic frameworks. Theoretical calculation indicated that the strong cooperative hydrogen bonds exist between acetylene and the pillared SiF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

Abstract
Tremendous progress has been made in the field of electrochemical energy storage devices that rely on potassium&#8208;ions as charge carriers due to their abundant resources and excellent ion transport properties. Nevertheless, future practical developments not only count on advanced electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance, but also on competitive costs of electrodes for scalable production. In the past few decades, advanced carbon materials have attracted great interest due to their low cost, high selectivity, and structural suitability and have been widely investigated as functional materials for potassium&#8208;ion storage. This article provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly developing field, focusing on recent advanced and mechanistic understanding of carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, we also discuss recent achievements of dual&#8208;ion batteries and conversion&#8208;type K&#8722;X (X=O2, CO2, S, Se, I2) batteries towards potential practical applications as high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;power devices, and summarize carbon&#8208;based materials as the host for K&#8208;metal protection and possible directions for the development of potassium energy&#8208;related devices as well. Based on this, we bridge the gaps between various carbon&#8208;based functional materials structure and the related potassium&#8208;ion storage performance, especially provide guidance on carbon material design principles for next&#8208;generation potassium&#8208;ion storage devices.

         <title>Balancing the Crystallinity and Film Formation of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes through In Situ Modulation for Efficient Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The balance between crystallinity and film&#8208;formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is demonstrated for the first time using a facile in situ modulation strategy. Through competitive complexation with a ligand, acetic acid systematically reduces the crystallinity and optimizes the film formation of the MOF membrane, influencing their gas separation properties.







Abstract
Polycrystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layers hold great promise as molecular sieve membranes for efficient gas separation. Nevertheless, the high crystallinity tends to cause inter&#8208;crystalline defects/cracks in the nearby crystals, which makes crystalline porous materials face a great challenge in the fabrication of defect&#8208;free membranes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the balance between crystallinity and film formation of MOF membrane through a facile in situ modulation strategy. Monocarboxylic acid was introduced as a modulator to regulate the crystallinity via competitive complexation and thus concomitantly control the film&#8208;forming state during membrane growth. Through adjusting the ratio of modulator acid/linker acid, an appropriate balance between this structural &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; was achieved. The resulting MOF membrane with moderate crystallinity and coherent morphology exhibits molecular sieving for H2/CO2 separation with selectivity up to 82.5.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkylation of Internal Olefin with Cycloalkanone to Directly Access Polycyclic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel SPD&#8208;NH2 organocatalyst that works cooperatively with a PdII complex to catalyze the asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation. It demonstrates great reactivity, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, bridged or fused bicyclic systems can conveniently transformed into diverse di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetracyclic scaffolds for further conversion into biologically important compounds.







Abstract
An asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation of unactivated internal olefins with tethered cyclic ketones was realized by the cooperative catalysis of a newly designed chiral amine (SPD&#8208;NH2) and PdII complex, providing straightforward access to either bridged or fused bicyclic systems containing three stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Notably, the bicyclic products could be conveniently transformed into a diverse range of key structures frequently found in bioactive terpenes, such as &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene, cracroson D, and vulgarisins. The steric hindrance between the Ar group of the SPD&#8208;NH2 catalyst and the branched chain of the substrate, hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the N&#8722;H of the enamine motif and the C=O of the directing group MQ, and the counterion of the PdII complex were identified as key factors for excellent stereoinduction in this dual catalytic process by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Insights into the Diffusion Behaviors of Water over Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Catalysts During Syngas to High&#8208;Quality Gasoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite converts syngas to gasoline with high selectivity. The diffusion of water molecules through a hydrophilic catalyst is bidirectional, while the diffusion through a hydrophobic catalyst is unidirectional, thereby allowing control of syngas&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline side reactions related to water.







Abstract
Although considerable efforts towards directly converting syngas to liquid fuels through Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis have been made, developing catalysts with low CO2 selectivity for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline remains a big challenge. Herein, we designed a bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite, which exhibited a low CO2 selectivity of 14.3&#8201;% at 49.8&#8201;% CO conversion, with a high selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% for gasoline in total products. Molecular dynamic simulations and model experiments revealed that the diffusion of water molecules through hydrophilic catalyst was bidirectional, while the diffusion through hydrophobic catalyst was unidirectional, which were crucial to tune the water&#8208;gas shift reaction and control CO2 formation. This work provides a new fundamental understanding about the function of hydrophobic modification of catalysts in syngas conversion.

         <title>Accelerated Surface Reconstruction through Regulating the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface by Oxyanions in Perovskite Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the spontaneous chemical reaction process of LaNiO3&#8722;&#948;, the oxyanions were added into electrolytes to regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxyanions would adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction. It could be an effective way to accelerate surface reconstruction process.







Abstract
A comprehensive understanding of surface reconstruction was critical to developing high performance lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based perovskite electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the primary determining factor of the surface reconstruction process was believed to be the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Hence, most previous studies focused on optimizing composition to reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which in turn facilitated the surface reconstruction process. Here, for the first time, we found that adding oxyanions (SO42&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) into the electrolyte could effectively regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface, significantly accelerating the surface reconstruction process and enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. Further studies indicated that the added oxyanions would adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface layer, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process. As such, the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process could be more readily released into the electrolyte, thereby leading to an acceleration of the surface reconstruction. Thus, it was expected that our finding would provide a new layer of understanding to the surface reconstruction process in LOM&#8208;based perovskite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Cooperative and Orthogonal Switching in the Solid State Enabled by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Confinement Leading to a Thermo&#8208;Photochromic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like two color&#8208;changing chameleons coming face to face, integration of two distinct stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within the same platform results in their synergistic behavior. Perturbation of the chameleons&#8217; environment upon a different external stimulus breaks the synergy, promoting their orthogonal behavior, a concept highlighted for a novel hierarchical photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework.







Abstract
Cooperative behavior and orthogonal responses of two classes of coordinatively integrated photochromic molecules towards distinct external stimuli were demonstrated on the first example of a photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive hierarchical platform. Synergetic and orthogonal responses to temperature and excitation wavelength are achieved by confining the stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), leading to the preparation of a novel photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive spiropyran&#8208;diarylethene based material. Synergistic behavior of two photoswitches enables the study of stimuli&#8208;responsive resonance energy transfer as well as control of the photoinduced charge transfer processes, milestones required to advance optoelectronics development. Spectroscopic studies in combination with theoretical modeling revealed a nonlinear effect on the material electronic structure arising from the coordinative integration of photoresponsive molecules with distinct photoisomerization mechanisms. Thus, the reported work covers multivariable facets of not only fundamental aspects of photoswitch cooperativity, but also provides a pathway to modulate photophysics and electronics of multidimensional functional materials exhibiting thermo&#8208;photochromism.

         <title>Insights into the Correlation of Cross&#8208;linking Modes with Mechanical Properties for Dynamic Polymeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on comprehensive comparison on mechanical properties between dually cross&#8208;linked network and individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linked network, we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking mode can combine the advantages of covalent cross&#8208;links and supramolecular cross&#8208;links, exhibiting not only quick deformation recovery, outstanding breaking stress and puncture resistance, but also excellent toughness and energy dissipation ability.







Abstract
Simultaneously introducing covalent and supramolecular cross&#8208;links into one system to construct dually cross&#8208;linked networks, has been proved an effective approach to prepare high&#8208;performance materials. However, so far, features and advantages of dually cross&#8208;linked networks compared with those possessing individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linking points are rarely investigated. Herein, on the basis of comparison between supramolecular polymer network (SPN), covalent polymer network (CPN) and dually cross&#8208;linked polymer network (DPN), we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking strategy can endow the DPN with integrated advantages of CPN and SPN. Benefiting from the energy dissipative ability along with the dissociation of host&#8211;guest complexes, the DPN shows excellent toughness and ductility similar to the SPN. Meanwhile, the elasticity of covalent cross&#8208;links in the DPN could rise the structural stability to a level comparable to the CPN, exhibiting quick deformation recovery capacity. Moreover, the DPN has the strongest breaking stress and puncture resistance among the three, proving the unique property advantages of dual cross&#8208;linking method. These findings gained from our study further deepen the understanding of dynamic polymeric networks and facilitate the preparation of high&#8208;performance elastomeric materials.

         <title>An Endogenous Prompting Mechanism for Sulfur Conversions Via Coupling with Polysulfides in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional sulfur conversion reactions suffer from severe shuttle effects as well as sluggish redox kinetics. Here, We achieved an endogenous facilitation mechanism for sulfur conversion which constructing a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of the promotors to promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions by coupling lithium polysulfides with functional molecules. By regulating the intermediates solubility and mediating the reaction kinetics, organophosphorus polysulfides as endogenous promotors can simultaneously eliminate the shuttle effect and improve the sulfur electrode process.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics process and shuttling of soluble intermediates present in complex conversion between sulfur and lithium sulfide severely limit the practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Herein, by introducing a designated functional organic molecule to couple with polysulfide intermediators, an endogenous prompting mechanism of sulfur conversions has thus been created leading to an alternative sulfur&#8208;electrode process, in another words, to build a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of promotors that can promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions. The coupling&#8208;intermediators between the functional organic molecule and polysulfides, organophosphorus polysulfides, to be the &#8220;promotors&#8221; for sulfur conversions, are not only insoluble in the electrolyte but also with higher redox&#8208;activity. So the sulfur&#8208;electrode process kinetics is greatly improved and the shuttle effect is eliminated simultaneously by this strategy. Meanwhile, with the endogenous prompting mechanism, the morphology of the final discharge product can be modified into a uniform covering film, which is more conducive to its decomposition when charging. Benefiting from the effective mediation of reaction kinetics and control of intermediates solubility, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries can act out excellent rate performance and cycling stability.

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Difluorocarbene Transfer via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles via palladium catalysis has been developed. This reaction overcomes the intrinsic limitations of electrophilic difluorocarbene and allows difluoromethylation of various aryl bromides and aryl triflates. Experimental mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium(0/II) pathway is responsible for this reductive reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles has been developed, representing a new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The approach uses low&#8208;cost and bulk industrial chemical chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H) as the difluorocarbene precursor. It produces a variety of difluoromethylated (hetero)arenes from widely available aryl halides/triflates and proton sources, featuring high functional group tolerance and synthetic convenience without preparing organometallic reagents. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that an unexpected Pd0/II catalytic cycle is involved in this reductive reaction, wherein the oxidative addition of palladium(0) difluorocarbene ([Pd0(Ln)]=CF2) with aryl electrophile to generate the key intermediate aryldifluoromethylpalladium [ArCF2Pd(Ln)X], followed by reaction with hydroquinone, is responsible for the reductive difluorocarbene transfer.

         <title>Isostructural Nanocluster Manipulation Reveals Pivotal Role of One Surface Atom in Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we demonstrate surface single&#8208;atom manipulation based on [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine), leading to the isostructural analogue [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Remarkably, this single surface atom drastically alters the catalytic reactivity of the nanoclusters.







Abstract
Elucidating single&#8208;atom effects on the fundamental properties of nanoparticles is challenging because single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we report the synthesis of a [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine) nanocluster&#8212;an atomically precise nanoparticle&#8212;that can be transformed into the surface&#8208;defective analog [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Both nanoclusters are virtually identical, with five concentric metal shells, save for one missing surface copper atom in Cu57. Remarkably, the loss of this single surface atom drastically alters the reactivity of the nanocluster. In contrast to Cu58, Cu57 shows promising activity for click chemistry, particularly photoinduced [3+2] azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AAC), which is attributed to the active catalytic site in Cu57 after the removal of one surface copper atom. Our study not only presents a unique system for uncovering the effect of a single&#8208;surface atom modification on nanoparticle properties but also showcases single&#8208;atom surface modification as a powerful means for designing nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reaction&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Selective Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 System for Dual&#8208;Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;targeted CRISPR/Cas delivery strategy was developed to switch on antitumor immunity via bioorthogonal reaction. Selectively labeling tumor sites and the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved first, turning &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221;. The targeted accumulation of the CRISPR/Cas system within tumors via click chemistry then further enhanced cancer immunotherapy, substantially boosting antitumor effectiveness.







Abstract
CRISPR system&#8208;assisted immunotherapy is an attractive option in cancer therapy. However, its efficacy is still less than expected due to the limitations in delivering the CRISPR system to target cancer cells. Here, we report a new CRISPR/Cas9 tumor&#8208;targeting delivery strategy based on bioorthogonal reactions for dual&#8208;targeted cancer immunotherapy. First, selective in vivo metabolic labeling of cancer and activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved simultaneously through tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;biodegradable hollow manganese dioxide (H&#8208;MnO2) nano&#8208;platform. Subsequently, CRISPR/Cas9 system&#8208;loaded liposome was accumulated within the modified tumor tissue through in vivo click chemistry, resulting in the loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) and further sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, our strategy provides a modular platform for precise gene editing in vivo and exhibits potent antitumor response by boosting innate and adaptive antitumor immunity.

         <title>Reactivity Umpolung of Tertiary Amide Enabled by Catalytic Reductive Stannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide carbonyl group usually serves as the electrophile, which can react with various nucleophiles. The current work shows a process to achieve the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide carbonyl group. By leveraging this strategy, tertiary amide can react with a wide range of electrophiles to produce complex amines.







Abstract
Reactivity umpolung is an important concept in organic chemistry. Established reactivity umpolung mainly focuses on the aldehyde and umpolung of amide carbonyl group is not known. In this report, we describe a process to obtain the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide. This process hinges on the efficient reductive stannylation catalyzed by Ir/silane and facile Sn&#8722;Li exchange. By leveraging this umpolung reactivity, drug Fluoxetine was derivatized to 12 different analogues via reacting with various electrophiles and four biologically active molecules were prepared concisely. This unlocked umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide is expected to find applications to synthesize complex amines from amides.

         <title>An Interfacial View of Cation Effects on Electrocatalysis Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identity of alkali metal cations plays a paramount role in tuning the activity and selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and electrochemical reduction of CO2. From the chemical and/or electrostatic interactions with adsorbed intermediates to the redistribution of interfacial water layer and buffering the interfacial pH, cations greatly influence the crucial steps of electrocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte of electrocatalysis systems has been recently introduced as a crucial factor to tailor the kinetics and Faradaic efficiency of many electrocatalytic reactions. In this Minireview, we have summarized the recent advances in the molecular&#8208;level understanding of cation effects on relevant electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) reactions. The discussion covers the effects of electrolyte cations on interfacial electric fields, structural organization of interfacial water molecules, blocking the catalytic active sites, stabilization or destabilization of intermediates, and interfacial pHs. These cation&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena have been reported to impact the performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) of electrochemical reactions collaboratively or independently. We describe that although there is almost a general agreement on the relationship between the size of alkali cations and the activities of HER, OER, and CO2RR, however, the mechanism by which the performance of these electrocatalytic reactions is influenced by alkali metal cations is still in debate.

We describe that although there is almost a general agreement on the relationship between the size of alkali cations and the activities of HER, OER, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, however, the mechanism by which the performance of these electrocatalytic reactions is influenced by alkali metal cations is still in debate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Secretion&#8208;Catalyzed Assembly of Protein Biomaterials on a Bacterial Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to autonomously assemble recombinant silk peptides on its own membrane, and then release them as fibers into the extracellular milieu. The process, called secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly, enables coupled synthesis, assembly, and processing of biomaterials by microbes.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based biomaterials have played a key role in tissue engineering, and additional exciting applications as self&#8208;healing materials and sustainable polymers are emerging. Over the past few decades, recombinant expression and production of various fibrous proteins from microbes have been demonstrated; however, the resulting proteins typically must then be purified and processed by humans to form usable fibers and materials. Here, we show that the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to secrete silk through its translocon via an orthogonal signal peptide/peptidase pair. Surprisingly, we discover that this translocation mechanism drives the silk proteins to assemble into fibers spontaneously on the cell surface, in a process we call secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly (SCA). Secreted silk fibers form self&#8208;healing hydrogels with minimal processing. Alternatively, the fibers retained on the membrane provide a facile route to create engineered living materials from Bacillus cells. This work provides a blueprint to achieve autonomous assembly of protein biomaterials in useful morphologies directly from microbial factories.

         <title>Coordination Defect&#8208;Induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Polyoxo&#8208;metalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination defect&#8208;induced strategy gives frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) sites in a polyoxometalate (POM) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), where the Lewis acid (LA) sites are linker&#8208;defective metal nodes and the Lewis base (LB) sites are derived from surface oxygen atoms of the POM. This FLP catalyst achieved heterolytic dissociation of H2 into highly active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting excellent activity in acetylene hydrogenation.







Abstract
Precise control of the structure and spatial distance of Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) sites in a porous system to construct efficient solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst is vital for industrial application but remains challenging. Herein, we constructed FLP sites in a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) by introducing coordination&#8208;defect metal nodes (LA) and surface&#8208;basic POM with abundant oxygen (LB). The well&#8208;defined and unique spatial conformation of the defective POM&#8208;based MOF ensure that the distance between LA and LB is at ~4.3&#8197;&#197;, a suitable distance to activate H2. This FLP catalyst can heterolytically dissociate H2 into active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting high activity in hydrogenation, which is 55 and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of defect&#8208;free POM&#8208;based MOF and defective MOF without POM, respectively. This work provides a new avenue toward precise design multi&#8208;site catalyst to achieve specific activation of target substrate for synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Coordination and Activation of N2 at Low&#8208;Valent Magnesium using a Heterobimetallic Approach: Synthesis and Reactivity of a Masked Dimagnesium Diradical
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) diamide with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI under an N2 atmosphere has given a complex between magnesium and doubly reduced dinitrogen, N22&#8722;. The reaction has been calculated to proceed via an anionic magnesium(I) radical, and the final product shown to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reactions with CO, H2 and C2H4.







Abstract
The activation of dinitrogen (N2) by transition metals is central to the highly energy intensive, heterogeneous Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Considerable progress has been made towards more sustainable homogeneous activations of N2 with d&#8208; and f&#8208;block metals, though little success has been had with main group metals. Here we report that the reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) amide [(TCHPNON)Mg] (TCHPNON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene) with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI yields the magnesium&#8208;N2 complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]. DFT calculations and experimental data show that the dinitrogen unit in the complex has been reduced to the N22&#8722; dianion, via a transient anionic magnesium(I) radical. The compound readily reductively activates CO, H2 and C2H4, in reactions in which it acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical.

         <title>Stereoselective Plasmonic Interaction in Peptide&#8208;tethered Photopolymerizable Diacetylenes Doped with Chiral Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;tethered diacetylene monomers exhibit efficient topochemical photopolymerization and allow control over the chiroptical properties of the resulting chiral polydiacetylenes. Achiral and chiral gold nanoparticles were incorporated in the chiral polymers and the stereoselective plasmonic interactions investigated, with the ultimate goal of designing next&#8208;generation organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials with large chiroptic effects.







Abstract
Designing polymeric systems with ultra&#8208;high optical activity is instrumental in the pursuit of smart artificial chiroptical materials, including the fundamental understanding of structure/property relations. Herein, we report a diacetylene (DA) moiety flanked by chiral D&#8208; and L&#8208;FF dipeptide methyl esters that exhibits efficient topochemical photopolymerization in the solid phase to furnish polydiacetylene (PDA) with desired control over the chiroptical properties. The doping of the achiral gold nanoparticles provides plasmonic interaction with the PDAs to render asymmetric shape to the circular dichroism bands. With the judicious design of the chiral amino acid ligand appended to the AuNPs, we demonstrate the first example of selective chiral amplification mediated by stereo&#8208;structural matching of the polymer&#8208;plasmonic AuNP hybrid pairs. Such ordered self&#8208;assembly aided by topochemical polymerization in peptide&#8208;tethered PDA provides a smart strategy to produce soft responsive materials for applications in chiral photonics.

         <title>Accelerated Multi&#8208;step Sulfur Redox Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by Dual Defects in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In their Research Article (e202306901), Dan Luo, Zhongwei Chen et&#8197;al. report a novel dual&#8208;defect metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new catalyst type to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides. The missing linker defect and missing cluster defect significantly catalyze the sulfur reduction reaction. As a result, dual&#8208;defect MOF&#8208;based separators lead to a strongly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Total Structure, Electronic Structure and Catalytic Hydrogenation Activity of Metal&#8208;Deficient Chiral Polyhydride Cu57 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral metal&#8208;deficient Cu57 hydride&#8208;rich nanocluster was prepared by a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy. Its total structure and electronic structure were established by combined experimental and DFT results. Its optical and catalytic hydrogenation properties were studied.







Abstract
Accurate identifying and in&#8208;depth understanding of the defect sites in a working nanomaterial could hinge on establishing specific defect&#8208;activity relationships. Yet, atomically precise coinage&#8208;metal nanoclusters (NCs) possessing surface vacancy defects are scarce primarily owing to challenges in the synthesis and isolation of such defective NCs. Herein we report a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to synthesizing an intrinsically chiral and metal&#8208;deficient copper hydride&#8208;rich NC [Cu57H20(PET)36(TPP)4]+ (Cu57H20). Its total structure (including hydrides) and electronic structure are well established by combined experimental and computational results. Crystal structure reveals Cu57H20 features a cube&#8208;like Cu8 kernel embedded in a corner&#8208;missing metal&#8208;ligand shell of Cu49(PET)36(TPP)4. Single Cu vacancy defect site occurs at one corner of the shell, evocative of mono&#8208;lacunary polyoxometalates. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the above&#8208;mentioned point vacancy causes one surface hydride exposed as an interfacial capping &#956;3&#8208;H&#8722;, which is accessible in chemical reaction, as proved by deuterated experiment. Moreover, Cu57H20 shows catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of nitroarene. The success of this work opens the way for the research on well&#8208;defined chiral metal&#8208;deficient Cu and other metal NCs, including exploring their application in asymmetrical catalysis.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8211;Polysiloxane Double Network Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent aerogels of biopolymer&#8211;polysiloxane double networks have been developed. In their Research Article (e202306518), Satoru Takeshita and Takumi Ono have established a sequential protocol for condensation of methyltrimethoxysilane and crosslinking of various biopolymers such as alginate, carrageenan, pectin, and carboxymethyl cellulose in the same space. The drawbacks of biopolymers or polysiloxane alone can be overcome in their homogeneous composites, opening up a new concept for functional aerogels.

         <title>A Click Chemistry&#8208;Based Artificial Metallo&#8208;Nuclease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new click chemistry generated artificial metallonuclease is reported in the Research Article by Andrew Kellett et&#8197;al. (e202305759). The oxidative DNA damaging properties of a polynuclear copper binding ligand called TC&#8208;Thio is demonstrated. Copper&#8208;TC&#8208;Thio binds in the minor groove of genomic DNA and promotes damage via a superoxide linked mechanism. The inset picture shows copper ions, bound to the TC&#8208;Thio ligand, melting into the DNA duplex and filling the reaction chamber with molten liquid DNA.

         <title>Topochemical Syntheses of Polyarylopeptides Involving Large Molecular Motions: Frustrated Monomer Packing Leads to the Formation of Polymer Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of aryl rings in the backbone of polymer chains is one of the key strategies to improve the chain rigidity and hence the properties. In peptide chemistry the technique gave birth to a new class of molecular systems called arylopeptides. Here we discuss the synthesis of polyarylopeptides, peptide polymers with periodic aryl units, from amino acid&#8208;based monomers via topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization.







Abstract
We report the topochemical syntheses of three polyarylopeptides, wherein triazolylphenyl group is integrated into the backbone of peptide chains. We synthesized three different monomers having azide and arylacetylene as end&#8208;groups from glycine, L&#8208;alanine and L&#8208;valine. We crystallized these monomers and the crystal structures of two of them were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Due to the steric constraints, both of these monomers crystallized with two molecules, viz. conformers A and B, in the asymmetric unit. Consistently, in both cases, the A&#8208;conformers are antiparallelly &#960;&#8208;stacked and B&#8208;conformers are parallelly slip&#8208;stacked, exploiting weak interactions. Though the arrangements of molecules in the pristine crystals were unsuitable for topochemical reaction, upon heating, they undergo large motion inside the crystal lattice to reach a transient reactive orientation and thereby the self&#8208;sorted conformer stacks react to give a blend of triazole&#8208;linked polyarylopeptides having two different linkages. Due to the large molecular motion inside crystals, the product phase loses its crystallinity.

         <title>A Modular Approach for the Synthesis of Natural and Artificial Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust chem&#8208;stamp approach consisting of two steps, one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to alkenyl boronates and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of these alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols, has been developed for the construction of key isoprene units in terpenoids. This approach enables the modular concise synthesis of terpenoids and the creation of artificial terpenoids with control over the number of isoprene units, the side chain, and two terminal groups.







Abstract
Many terpenoids with isoprene unit(s) demonstrating critical biological activities have been isolated and characterized. In this study, we have developed a robust chem&#8208;stamp strategy for the construction of the key isoprene unit, which consists of two steps: one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to the alkenyl boronates by the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols to yield enals. This chem&#8208;stamp could readily be applied repeatedly and separately, enabling the modular concise synthesis of many natural and pharmaceutically active terpenoids, including retinal, &#946;&#8208;carotene, vitamin A, tretinoin, fenretinide, acitretin, ALRT1550, nigerapyrone C, peretinoin, and lycopene. Owing to the diversified availability of the starting materials, aldehydes and 2,3&#8208;allenols, creation of new non&#8208;natural terpenoids has been realized from four dimensions: the number of isoprene units, the side chain, and the two terminal groups.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Directed Site&#8208;Selective Csp3&#8208;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borylation of Csp3&#8208;H bonds is a challenging transformation that is typically restricted to transition metal catalysis. Herein, we report the site&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free Csp3&#8211;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines. It is possible to selectively borylate piperidine derivatives at the &#945; or &#946; positions according to the reaction conditions. The mechanism was supported by NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations. It suggests that the piperidine is dehydrogenated by complexation with BBr3 to produce an enamine intermediate, which is in turn borylated at either the &#945; or &#946; position according to the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Crystal Monomer to Single Crystal Polymer Reaction Activated by a Triplet Excimer in a Zipper Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study focused on the elucidation of the polymerization mechanism of crystal monomer to crystal polymer reaction of a bisindacene compound in the solid state has been carried out. The experimental description and characterization of the polymer product have been reported elsewhere and, in this article, we address the first detailed description of the polymerization process. This reaction pathway consists in the initial formation of a triplet excimer state that relaxes to a intermolecular bonded triplet state that is the starting point of the propagation step of the polymerization. The overall process can be visualized in the monomer starting state as an open zipper in which a cursor or slider is formed by light absorption and the whole zipper is then closed by propagation of the double cursor. To this end, variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and vibrational Raman spectroscopic data have been implemented in combination with quantum chemical calculations. The presented mechanistic insight is of great value to understand the intricacies of such important reaction, and to envisage and diversify the products produced by it.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Radius&#8208;Controlled Sn&#8208;O Bond Length Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the intriguing potential shown by Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the rational optimization of their CO2RR properties is still lacking. Here we report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8208;O bond lengths. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples of Ba1&#8208;xSrxSnO3, as the A&#8208;site cation average radii decrease from 1.61 to 1.44 &#197;, their Sn&#8208;O bonds are precisely shortened from 2.06 to 2.02 &#197;. Our CO2RR measurements show that the activity and selectivity of these samples for HCOOH production exhibit volcano&#8208;type trends with the Sn&#8208;O bond lengths. Among these samples, the Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3 features the optimal activity (753.6 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2) and selectivity (90.9%) for HCOOH, better than those of the reported Sn&#8208;based oxides. Such optimized CO2RR properties could be attributed to favorable merits conferred by the precisely controlled Sn&#8208;O bond lengths, e.g., the regulated band center, modulated adsorption/activation of intermediates, and reduced energy barrier for *OCHO formation. This work brings a new avenue for rational design of advanced Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides toward CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Zn Anode Utilization by Trace Iodine Ions in Organic&#8211;Water Hybrid Electrolytes through Formation of Anion&#8208;rich Adsorbing Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H2O&#8208;induced Zn&#8208;corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H2O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50 mM iodine ions into an organic&#8208;water (1, 2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) + water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H2O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond network and exclude H2O from Zn2+ solvation shell. And the I&#8208; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation barrier from 74.33 kJ mol&#8208;1 to 32.26 kJ mol&#8208;1 and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5 months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5%). In particular, the Zn//VS2@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170 cycles at a low N:P ratio (3.64). Even with the cathode mass&#8208;loading of 16.7 mg cm&#8208;2, the full cell maintains the areal capacity of 0.96 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 1600 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple&#8208;Bidentate Nitrate&#8208;Ligated A2Hg(NO3)4 (A = K, Rb): Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Sufficient Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal continues to pose significant challenges due to the difficulty of assembling polar NLO&#8208;active modules in an optimal additive fashion. We report herein the first NLO&#8208;active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A = K (KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), for which assembly is induced by ionic polarization of the d10 cations. The two new crystalline compounds are isostructural, featuring interesting pseudo&#8208;diamond&#8208;like structures with parallel [Hg(NO3)4] modules, and leading to strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses of 9.2 (KHNO) and 8.8 (RHNO) times that of KH2PO4. In combination with the simple solution preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale crystals, sufficient birefringence, and short UV cutoff edges, these attributes make KHNO and RHNO promising candidates for ultraviolet NLO materials. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis reveal that the newly&#8208;developed highly condensed and distorted [Hg(NO3)4] module, with an Hg2+ cation that is quadruply bidentate nitrate&#8208;ligated, is crucial for the significant SHG responses. This work highlights the potential importance of modules with multiple bidentate ligands for the development of high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Additive&#8208;Induced Interphases Enable Highly Stable 4.6 V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their promising high energy density. However, severe capacity degradation is witnessed, which originated from the incompatible and unstable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase at high voltage. Herein, a robust additive&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;rich interphase is constructed by introducing an ultrahigh S&#8208;content of 34.04% additive (methylene methyl disulfonate, MMDS) in 4.6 V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)||graphite pouch cell. The MMDS does not directly participate the inner Li+ sheath, but the strong interactions between MMDS and PF6&#8208; anions promote the preferential decomposition of MMDS and broaden the oxidation stability, and facilitate the formation of an ultrathin but robust sulfur&#8208;rich interfacial layer. The electrolyte consumption, gas production, phase transformation and dissolution of transition metal ions were effectively inhibited. As expected, the 4.6 V NCM523||graphite pouch cell delivers a high capacity retention of 87.99% even after 800 cycles. This work shares new insight into the sulfur&#8208;rich additive&#8208;induced electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase for stable high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>

Despite the emergence of many other genres of photocatalysts over the years, TMO photocatalysts remain dominant due to their easy synthesis and unique physicochemical properties. Various strategies have been developed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TMOs, but the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of TMO photocatalysts is still very low (&lt; 2%), which is far below the targeted STH of 10% for commercial viability. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of several widely used strategies, including oxygen defects control, doping, establishing interfacial junctions, and phase&#8208;facet&#8208;morphology engineering, that have been adopted to improve TMO photocatalysts. By critically evaluating these strategies and providing a roadmap for future research directions, this article serves as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals seeking to develop efficient energy materials for green energy solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Way Catalysis in Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Limits Inhibition Induced by External Electric Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oriented external electric fields (EEFs) act as catalysts that can induce selectivity in chemical reactions. The responses of the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and ethylene (BDE&#8208;DA) as well as cyclopentadiene and ethylene (CPDE&#8208;DA) towards EEF stimuli are investigated here using density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations. EEF is a vector that catalyzes the reaction in one direction while inhibiting it in the opposite direction. Here we report that the inhibitive direction becomes rate&#8208;enhancing after some increase in the EEF. The EEF value that brings about the maximum possible inhibition for the reaction is defined as the electrostatic resistance point (ERP). The possibility of both normal and inverse electron&#8208;demand DA reactions causes catalytic activity in both directions of the EEF starting at a unique ERP value. The C5 substituents of cyclopentadiene control the ERP values depending upon the resistance power that the functional group provides against the EEF. The endo and exo diastereomeric transition states of the DA reaction have distinct ERP values and the difference (&#916;ERP) provides the through&#8208;space electrostatic contribution to the stereoselectivity on a relative scale. Thus, the ERP values can be used as a gauge for the electrostatic interactions between substituent groups and external stimuli.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A main&#8208;group catalysis&#8208;based strategy to access 8&#8208;membered carbocycles via the direct carbofunctionalization of 2&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes is disclosed. Through the intervention of an I(I)/I(III) catalysis cycle, the synthesis of densely functionalized, fluorinated benzocyclooctenes can be achieved in an operationally simple manner. Modulating the oxidation / activation regime, and the external nucleophile, the process has been extended to unify the challenging cyclization with formation of allylic C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;C bonds (&gt;30 examples).

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Stereoselective Glycosylation via Rh(II) and Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Cocatalyzed Carbenoid Insertion to Anomeric OH Bond for the Synthesis of Glycoconjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical synthesis of glycoconjugates is essential for studying the biological functions of carbohydrates. We herein report an efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of challenging &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates via a Rh(II)/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion to the anomeric OH bond. Notably, we observed excellent anomeric selectivity, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency for this glycosylation reaction by exploring various parameters of the cocatalytic system. DFT calculations suggested that the anomeric selectivity was mainly determined by steric interactions between the C2&#8208;carbon of the carbohydrate and the phenyl group of the metal carbenoid, while &#960;/&#960; interactions with the C2&#8208;OBn substituent on the carbohydrate substrate play a significant role for diastereoselectivity at the newly generated stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;metal Ionothermal Synthesis of Metallophthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines (PCs) are intriguing building blocks owing to their stability, physicochemical and catalytic properties. Although PC&#8208;based polymers have been reported before, many suffer from relatively low stability, crystallinity, and low surface areas. Utilizing a mixed metal salt ionothermal approach, we report the synthesis of a series of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene and 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetracyanoanthracene to form the corresponding COFs named M&#8208;pPPCs and M&#8208;anPPCs, respectively. The obtained COFs followed the Irving&#8208;Williams series in their metal contents, surface areas, and pore volume and featured excellent CO2 uptake capacities up to 7.6 mmol g&#8208;1 at 273 K, 1.1 bar. We also investigated the growth of the Co&#8208;pPPC and Co&#8208;anPPC on a highly conductive carbon nanofiber and demonstrated their high catalytic activity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction, which showed Faradaic efficiencies towards CO up to 74% at &#8208;0.64 V vs. RHE.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis with Gaseous Molecular Ions: Harvesting [B12Br11N2]&#8722; From a Mass Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass spectrometry frequently reveals the existence of transient gas phase ions that have not been synthesized in solution or in bulk. These elusive ions are, therefore, often considered to be primarily of analytical value in fundamental gas phase studies. Here, we provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the products of ion&#8208;molecule reactions in mass spectrometers may be collected on surfaces to generate condensed matter and thus serve as building blocks to synthesize new compounds. The highly reactive fragment anion [B12Br11]&#8722; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B12Br11N2]&#8722; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass&#8208;selection and soft&#8208;landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B12Br11N2]&#8722;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B12Br11N2]&#8722; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N2 and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B12Br11]&#8722; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Thus, isolation of [B12Br11N2]&#8722; expands the repertoire of the available diazo ions that can be employed as versatile intermediates in various chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework&#8208;Hotspot Enhanced Trans Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Clinical Samples Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generate framework&#8208;hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities and investigate their impact on trans cleavage activity of Cas12a. Further, a modular platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction is developed, which enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples.







Abstract
The trans&#8208;cleavage property of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system makes it an excellent tool for disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, most methods based on CRISPR&#8208;Cas system still require pre&#8208;amplification of the target to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. Here we generate Framework&#8208;Hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities to investigate their effect on trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a. We find that the cleavage efficiency increases and the cleavage rate accelerates with increasing reporter density. We further construct a modular sensing platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction. Encouragingly, this modular platform enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples. The design provides a facile strategy for enhanced trans cleavage of Cas12a, which accelerates and broadens its applications in biosensing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trans-cleavage property of CRISPR-Cas12a system makes it an excellent tool for disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, most methods based on CRISPR-Cas system still require pre-amplification of the target to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. Here we generate Framework-Hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities to investigate their effect on trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a. We find that the cleavage efficiency increases and the cleavage rate accelerates with increasing reporter density. We further construct a modular sensing platform with CRISPR-Cas12a-based target recognition and FHR-based signal transduction. Encouragingly, this modular platform enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&amp;lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre-amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples. The design provides a facile strategy for enhanced trans cleavage of Cas12a, which accelerates and broadens its applications in biosensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Thiazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Lithium&#8208;Sulphur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline and porous materials, which offer a platform for integrating functional moieties in their backbone. Also, these materials can be post&#8208;synthetically modified for targeted applications. Herein, using molecular sulphur (S8), a post&#8208;synthetic topochemical conversion of an imine&#8208;linked COF into a thiazole&#8208;linked COF was performed for enhancing energy storage performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulphur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are a promising alternative power source, as they can provide a higher energy density than current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Porous materials are often used as cathode materials as they can act as a host for sulphur in such batteries. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have also been used, however they typically suffer from stability issues, resulting in limited and thus insufficient durability under practical conditions and applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based dimethoxybenzo&#8208;dithiophene functionalized COF (TTT&#8208;DMTD) incorporating high&#8208;density redox sites. The imine linkages were further post&#8208;synthetically transformed to yield a robust thiazole&#8208;linked COF (THZ&#8208;DMTD) by utilizing a sulphur&#8208;assisted chemical conversion method, while maintaining the crystallinity. As a synergistic effect of its high crystallinity, porosity and the presence of redox&#8208;active moieties, the thiazole&#8208;linked THZ&#8208;DMTD exhibited a high capacity and long&#8208;term stability (642&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;C; 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles) when applied as a cathode material in a Li&#8722;S battery.

         <title>Fucose Binding Motifs on Mucin Core Glycopeptides Impact Bacterial Lectin Recognition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable studies of fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins, a library of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides carrying Lewis&#8208; and H&#8208;antigen structures on mucin core glycans was prepared using a chemoenzymatic approach. This library was applied to evaluate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB and the Clostridium difficile toxin A binding preferences to explore the importance of the glycan core and peptide backbone presentation for lectin recognition.







Abstract
Mucin glycoproteins are essential components of the mucosal barrier, which protects the host from pathogens. Throughout evolution, bacteria have developed strategies to modulate and penetrate this barrier, and cause virulence by interacting with mucin O&#8208;glycans at the epithelial cell&#8208;surface. O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes on mucins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. Here, a chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy is described to prepare a library of fucosylated mucin core glycopeptides to enable studies of mucin&#8208;interacting and fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins. Glycan cores with biologically important Lewis and H&#8208;antigens were prepared decorating the peptide backbone at different sites and densities. The fucosylated mucin glycopeptides were applied in microarray binding studies to explore the importance of glycan core and peptide backbone presentation of these antigens in binding interactions with the P.&#8197;aeruginosa lectin LecB and the C.&#8197;difficile toxin&#8197;A.

         <title>Identifying the Role of Lewis&#8208;base Sites for the Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base site of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 is capable of capturing Li+ during the discharge process, which can optimize the adsorption strength of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2 intermediates, thereby leading to the solution&#8208;mediated growth of Li2O2 and ultimately improving the discharge capacity of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery. In addition, Lewis&#8208;base site can promote the activation of O2 and Li2O2 to reduce the overpotential of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery.







Abstract
Lewis&#8208;base sites have been widely applied to regulate the properties of Lewis&#8208;acid sites in electrocatalysts for achieving a drastic technological leap of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Whereas, the direct role and underlying mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base in the chemistry for LOBs are still rarely elucidated. Herein, we comprehensively shed light on the pivotal mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base sites in promoting the electrocatalytic reaction processes of LOBs by constructing the metal&#8211;organic framework containing Lewis&#8208;base sites (named as UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can act as electron donors that boost the activation of O2/Li2O2 during the discharged&#8208;charged process, resulting in the accelerated reaction kinetics of LOBs. More importantly, the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra and DFT calculations firstly demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can convert Li2O2 growth mechanism from surface&#8208;adsorption growth to solvation&#8208;mediated growth due to the capture of Li+ by Lewis&#8208;base sites upon discharged process, which weakens the adsorption energy of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2. As a proof of concept, LOB based on UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can achieve a high discharge specific capacity (12&#8201;661&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low discharged&#8208;charged overpotential (0.87&#8197;V) and long cycling life (169&#8197;cycles). This work reveals the direct role of Lewis&#8208;base sites, which can guide the design of electrocatalysts featuring Lewis&#8208;acid/base dual centers for LOBs.

         <title>Facile Tuned TSCT&#8208;TADF in Donor&#8208;Acceptor MOF for Highly Adjustable Photonic Modules based on Heterostructures Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) were realized. Furthermore, heterostructures crystals featuring highly adjustable emissions in wide wavelength range was fabricated, illustrating its potential as photonic modules for photonic integrated circuit applications.







Abstract
Highly adjustable photonic modules were constructed based on the heterostructures crystals of a new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By introducing N&#8208;phenylcarbazole and derivatives as donor guests into the acceptor host NKU&#8208;111, highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer based TADF could be achieved through the engineering of heavy atom effect, which result in modulatable emission wavelength (540 to 600&#8197;nm) and enhanced quantum yield (up to 30.86&#8201;%). Furthermore, by rationally integrating the D&#8208;A MOFs with distinctive emissions, rod&#8208;like heterostructures crystals featuring excitation position dependent tip emissions in wide wavelength range (495 to 598&#8197;nm) could be fabricated, which could serve as highly potential photonic modules for photonic circuit applications.

         <title>Developing Insoluble Polyoxometalate Clusters to Bridge Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Water Oxidation Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cobalt(II)&#8208;containing polyoxometalate (POM) cluster&#8208;based solid catalysts were synthesized with different counter&#8208;cations and applied to photocatalytic water oxidation. Candidates in the series bridge homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts by offering activity comparable to the parent homogeneous catalyst and good recyclability.







Abstract
Cluster catalysts are attractive for their atomically precise structures, defined compositions, tunable coordination environments, uniform active sites, and their ability to transfer multiple electrons, but they suffer from poor stability and recyclability. Here, we report a general approach to the direct insolubilization of a water soluble polyoxometalate (POM) [{(B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PW9O34)Co3(OH)(H2O)2(O3PC(O)&#8208;(C3H6NH3)PO3)}2Co]14&#8722; (Co7) and formation of a series of POM&#8208;based solid catalysts with the counter&#8208;cations Ag+, Cs+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Y3+, and Ce3+. They exhibit improved catalytic activities for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation following the trend CsCo7&gt;SrCo7&gt;AgCo7&gt;CeIIICo7&gt;BaCo7&gt;YCo7&gt;PbCo7. While CsCo7 exhibits mainly homogeneous catalysis, the others are predominantly heterogeneous catalysts. An optimal oxygen yield of 41.3&#8201;% and a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 30.6&#8201;% for SrCo7 is obtained, which is comparable to that of the parent homogeneous POM. Band gap structures, UV/Vis spectra, and real&#8208;time laser flash photolysis experiments collectively suggest that easier electron transfer from the solid POM catalyst to the photosensitizer promotes photocatalytic water oxidation performance. These solid POM catalysts exhibit good stability, which is directly confirmed by a combination of Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, five cycles of tests, and poisoning experiments.

         <title>A Pro&#8208;Fluorescent Ubiquitin&#8208;Based Probe to Monitor Cysteine&#8208;Based E3 Ligase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an increased interest in E3 ligases as drug targets. Here we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye Rhodol triggering a strong fluorescence signal. Our platform allows detection of changes in E3 transthiolation activity in real time for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract ligases, as well as the discovery of new ligands for E3 ligases.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modification with ubiquitin (Ub) is a versatile signal regulating almost all aspects of cell biology, and an increasing range of diseases is associated with impaired Ub modification. In this light, the Ub system offers an attractive, yet underexplored route to the development of novel targeted treatments. A promising strategy for small molecule intervention is posed by the final components of the enzymatic ubiquitination cascade, E3 ligases, as they determine the specificity of the protein ubiquitination pathway. Here, we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe, which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye, amenable to profile the E3 transthiolation activity for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract E3 ligases. UbSRhodol enabled detection of changes in transthiolation efficacy evoked by enzyme key point mutations or conformational changes, and offers an excellent assay reagent amenable to a high&#8208;throughput screening setup allowing the identification of small molecules modulating E3 activity.

         <title>Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different reaction types (homolytic, heterolytic, and electrocyclic cleavage) can be selectively activated in the gas phase through a modulation of noncovalent interactions for a multifunctional amino&#8208;azoalkane, as shown by mass spectrometry, transition&#8208;state modeling, and DFT calculations. Three different &#963; bonds are being broken, demonstrating a supramolecular control of chemoselectivity that is reminiscent of mode&#8208;selective chemistry.







Abstract
In the gas phase, thermal activation of supramolecular assemblies such as host&#8211;guest complexes leads commonly to noncovalent dissociation into the individual components. Chemical reactions, for example of encapsulated guest molecules, are only found in exceptional cases. As observed by mass spectrometry, when 1&#8208;amino&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;2&#8208;ene (DBOA) is complexed by the macrocycle &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, its protonated complex undergoes collision&#8208;induced dissociation into its components, the conventional reaction pathway. Inside the macrocyclic cavity of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), a competitive chemical reaction of monoprotonated DBOA takes place upon thermal activation, namely a stepwise homolytic covalent bond cleavage with the elimination of N2, while the doubly protonated CB7&#8901;DBOA complex undergoes an inner&#8208;phase elimination of ethylene, a concerted, electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction. These chemical reaction pathways stand in contrast to the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of uncomplexed monoprotonated DBOA, for which an elimination of NH3 predominates upon collision&#8208;induced activation, as a heterolytic bond cleavage reaction. The combined results, which can be rationalized in terms of organic&#8208;chemical reaction mechanisms and density&#8208;function theoretical calculations, demonstrate that chemical reactions in the gas phase can be steered chemoselectively through noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized chiral cis&#8208;decalins was realized by merging Birch reduction and a tandem olefin migration/asymmetric IEDDA reaction. Up to six contiguous and two quaternary stereocenters could be formed in one step by efficient kinetic resolution. The synthetic value of the approach is illustrated by the concise total synthesis of (+)&#8208;occidentalol and the synthesis of a key intermediate for seven triterpenes.







Abstract
Herein, we show that the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well&#8208;modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/CuII complex, a wide range of polysubstituted cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds with up to six contiguous stereocenters were generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of the sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes formed in situ are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2&#8208; and/or C3&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates. DFT calculations elucidated that the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion and revealed the origins of the stereoselectivities.

         <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Pathologically Activated Assay for Efficient Bioorthogonal Catalytic Selective Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>

A representative acid/H2S&#8208;responsive molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) has been constructed for selective antibiofilm therapy. The Cu&#8208;POM NCs not only self&#8208;assemble into larger aggregates for biofilm&#8208;responsive and efficient alkyne&#8208;azide click (CuAAC) reactions to generate antibacterial molecules, but also produce a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect, switchable by H2S in pathogens for selective therapy.







Abstract
Since polyoxometalates (POMs) can undergo reversible multi&#8208;electron redox transformations, they have been used to modulate the electronic environment of metal nanoparticles for catalysis. Besides, POMs possess unique electronic structures and acid&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly ability. These properties inspired us to tackle the drawbacks of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction in biomedical applications, such as low catalytic efficiency and unsatisfactory disease selectivity. Herein, we construct molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM nanoclusters doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) as a highly efficient bioorthogonal catalyst, which is responsive to pathologicallyacid and H2S for selective antibiofilm therapy. Leveraging the merits of POMs, the Cu&#8208;POM NCs exhibit biofilm&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior, efficient CuAAC&#8208;mediated in situ synthesis of antibacterial molecules, and a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect selectively triggered by H2S in pathogens. The consumption of bacterial H2S at the pathological site by Cu&#8208;POM NCs extremely decreases the number of persisterbacteria, which is conducive to the inhibition of bacterial tolerance and elimination of biofilms. Unlocked at pathological sites and endowed with NIR&#8208;II photothermal property, the constructed POM&#8208;based bioorthogonal catalytic platform provides new insights into the design of efficient and selective bioorthogonal catalysts for disease therapy.

         <title>Direct Comparison of Lysine versus Site&#8208;Specific Protein Surface Immobilization in Single&#8208;Molecule Mechanical Assays
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface immobilization technique for atomic force microscopy/single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy is crucial for experimental yield, accuracy and resolution. Reported herein is that a commonly used lysine&#8208;based immobilization can result in significant signal deterioration, including lowering of rupture forces, effective shortening of linkers, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway polyprotein system.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force&#8208;transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site&#8208;specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site&#8208;specific vs. lysine&#8208;based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine&#8208; vs. ybbR&#8208;based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine&#8208;based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin&#8208;biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin&#8208;Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site&#8208;specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface&#8208;bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo&#8208;derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.

         <title>Programmed Pore&#8208;Shape Fixing in a Soft Porous Molecular Crystal&#8212;Navigating the Phase Interconversion Landscape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;known organic soft porous crystal is shown to undergo pore&#8208;shape fixing in response to high&#8208;pressure uptake of CO2 gas. Despite two decades of studies of this material, this work formulates, for the first time, an unambiguous phase interconversion Scheme to facilitate navigation of the metastable phase landscape, which now includes a 4th guest&#8208;free polymorph with enhanced porosity.







Abstract
Pore&#8208;shape fixing effects (PSFEs) in soft porous crystals are a relatively unexplored area of materials chemistry. We report the PSFE in the prototypical dynamic van der Waals solid p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (TBC4). Starting with the high&#8208;density guest&#8208;free phase, two porous shape&#8208;fixed phases were programmed using the stimuli of CO2 pressure and temperature. A suite of complementary in situ techniques, including variable&#8208;pressure (VP) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP differential scanning calorimetry, volumetric sorption analysis, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy was used to track dynamic guest&#8208;induced transformations, providing molecular&#8208;level insight into the PSFE. The interconversion between the two metastable phases is particle size dependent, making this the second example of the PSFE by crystal downsizing, and the first example involving a porous molecular crystal: larger particles undergo reversible transitions while smaller particles remain fixed in the metastable phase. A complete phase interconversion scheme was constructed for the material, thus allowing navigation of the phase interconversion landscape of TBC4 using the easily applied stimuli of CO2 pressure and thermal treatment.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;scan ultraselective heteronuclear polarization transfer (UHPT) NMR method is presented. When applied to chromopeptide pharmaceuticals and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide with highly complex NMR signals in both the 1H and 13C dimension, this method provided accurate 1H&#8208;13C correlation and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra of individual subunits, which enabled unambiguous structure assignment.







Abstract
Complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of organic compounds containing multiple analogous substructures or mixtures pose a significant challenge to structural identification, thus resulting in frequent misassignment of structures. The GEMSTONE method, a single&#8208;scan technique that selectively excites a specific proton signal among the crowded NMR signals, was recently proposed as a solution. However, its extension to the polarization transfer method for heteronuclear spin systems was unsuccessful. Herein, we present an extension method that addresses the altered heteronuclear polarization transfer efficiency and enables the acquisition of ultraselective 13C and 1H&#8208;13C correlation NMR subspectra with hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the structural analysis of a chromopeptide pharmaceutical and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide.

         <title>Unraveling the Oxidation Behaviors of MXenes in Aqueous Systems by Active&#8208;Learning&#8208;Potential Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation kinetics of MXenes were studied using active&#8208;learning&#8208;potential molecular dynamics. MXenes spontaneously oxidize to transition&#8208;metal oxides in water, which form oxide protection layers on the surface to further inhibit the oxidation process. The free protons in water also impair the water's motility, inhibiting its attack on the MXene surface.

MXenes are 2D materials with great potential in various applications. However, the degradation of MXenes in humid environments has become a main obstacle in their practical use. Here we combine deep neural networks and an active learning scheme to develop a neural network potential (NNP) for aqueous MXene systems with ab initio precision but low cost. The oxidation behaviors of super large aqueous MXene systems are investigated systematically at nanosecond timescales for the first time. The oxidation process of MXenes is clearly displayed at the atomic level. Free protons and oxides greatly inhibit subsequent oxidation reactions, leading to the degree of oxidation of MXenes to exponentially decay with time, which is consistent with the oxidation rate of MXenes measured experimentally. Importantly, this computational study represents the first exploration of the kinetic process of oxidation of super&#8208;sized aqueous MXene systems. It opens a promising avenue for the future development of effective protection strategies aimed at controlling the stability of MXenes.

&lt;p&gt;The oxidation kinetics of MXenes were studied using active-learning-potential molecular dynamics. MXenes spontaneously oxidize to transition-metal oxides in water, which form oxide protection layers on the surface to further inhibit the oxidation process. The free protons in water also impair the water's motility, inhibiting its attack on the MXene surface.

         <title>Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 27 oligosaccharides as heparan sulfate mimetics were efficiently synthesized from the natural aminoglycoside tobramycin in 7&#8211;12 steps. Rapid generation of these sulfated aminoglycans will provide a tool to decipher HS&#8208;protein interactions and develop HS therapeutic potential.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high&#8208; and low&#8208;sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure&#8208;function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well&#8208;defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7&#8211;12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps as compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insight, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from the aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off&#8208;target platelet factor&#8208;4 protein.

         <title>Illustrating the Fate of Methyl Radical in Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fleeting intermediates such as methyl radical (&#8901;CH3), methoxy radical and formaldehyde, were captured during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry, which sheds light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8901;CH3.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has emerged as an ideal method for the direct activation and conversion of methane under mild conditions. In this reaction, methyl radical (&#8901;CH3) was deemed a key intermediate that affected the yields and selectivity of the products. However, direct observation of &#8901;CH3 and other intermediates is still challenging. Here, a rectangular photocatalytic reactor coupled with in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS) was developed to detect reactive intermediates within several hundred microseconds during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO. Gas phase &#8901;CH3 generated by photogenerated holes (O&#8722;) was directly observed, and its formation was demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by coadsorbed oxygen molecules. Methoxy radical (CH3O&#8901;) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were confirmed to be key C1 intermediates in photocatalytic methane overoxidation to CO2. The gas&#8208;phase self&#8208;coupling reaction of &#8901;CH3 contributes to the formation of ethane, which indicates the key role of &#8901;CH3 desorption in the highly selective synthesis of ethane. Based on the observed intermediates, the reaction network initiated from &#8901;CH3 of photocatalytic methane oxidation could be clearly illustrated, which is helpful for studying the photocatalytic methane conversion processes.

         <title>New Anderson&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrodes for Energy Storage Boosted Through Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineering of novel nanostructured electrode materials represents a viable strategy to obtain devices with high energy and power density. We present the synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) with superior electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (125&#8197;F/g), energy and power density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg and 3.7&#8197;kW/kg, respectively) and high cyclability (5000 cycles).







Abstract
The unique electrochemical properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) render them ideal components for the fabrication of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems. However, their practical applications have been hindered by their high solubility in common electrolytes. This problem can be overcome by the effective hybridization of POMs with other materials. Here we present the design and synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) via one&#8208;pot solvothermal strategy between an amino&#8208;functionalized Anderson&#8208;type POM and a trialdehyde&#8208;based building unit. We show that structural and functional complexity can be enriched by adding hydroxyl groups in the 2,4,6 position to the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde allowing to exploit for the first time in POCOFs the keto&#8208;enol tautomerization as additional feature to impart greater chemical stability to the COFs and enhanced properties leading to large specific surface area (347&#8197;m2/g) and superior electrochemical performance of the POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes, when compared with POCOF&#8208;2 electrodes that possess only imine&#8208;type linkage and with pristine POM electrodes. Specifically, POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes display remarkable specific, areal, and volumetric capacitance (125&#8197;F/g, 248&#8197;mF/cm2 and 41.9&#8197;mF/cm3, respectively) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A/g, a maximum energy density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg), a maximum power density (3.7&#8197;kW/kg) and an outstanding cyclability (90&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).

         <title>Quantifying Degradation Parameters of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The cycling stability shows an inverse relationship with the thickness of the NiO surface layer. Simulation analysis further indicates that the slower Li+ diffusivity of NiO mainly accounts for the performance decay of the cathode.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal LiNixCoyMnzO2 (SC&#8208;NCM, x+y+z=1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long&#8208;term cycling. While advances have been made using SC&#8208;NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC&#8208;NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC&#8208;NCM65 cells showed &gt;77&#8201;% capacity retention below 4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56&#8201;% for 4.7&#8197;V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO&#8208;type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition&#8208;metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock&#8208;salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modeling analysis further indicate that the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.

&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SC-NCM, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;=1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long-term cycling. While advances have been made using SC-NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single-crystalline LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SC-NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC-NCM65 cells showed &amp;gt;77&#8201;% capacity retention below 4.6&#8197;V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56&#8201;% for 4.7&#8197;V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC-NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock-salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO-type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition-metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock-salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modeling analysis further indicate that the charge-transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise O2&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Disassembly of the [NiFe4(OH)(&#956;3&#8208;S)4] Active Site Cluster of CO Dehydrogenase</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) are inactivated by dioxygen. High&#8208;resolution crystallography was used to show how O2 induces a stepwise rearrangement of the Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster in the active site, with evidence for a reversible and an irreversible phase of cluster destruction. The open coordination site on Ni renders the cluster vulnerable, and its protection offers strategies to prevent inactivation.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. CODHs are found in anaerobic microorganisms and can rapidly lose their activity when exposed to air. What causes the loss of activity is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the time&#8208;dependent structural changes induced by the presence of air on the metal centers of CODH&#8208;II. We show that inactivation is a multistep process. In a reversible step, the open coordination site on the Ni ion is blocked by a Ni,Fe&#8208;bridging &#956;&#8208;sulfido or chlorido ligand. Blocking this open coordination site with a cyanide ligand stabilizes the cluster against O2&#8208;induced decomposition, indicating that O2 attacks at the Ni ion. In the subsequent irreversible phase, nickel is lost, the Fe ions rearrange and the sulfido ligands disappear. Our data are consistent with a reversible reductive reactivation mechanism to protect CODHs from transient over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of a Giant [Mn86] Nanocage&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Specific CO2 Binding Pockets for Highly Selective CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bioinspired design strategy, a CO2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a, is fabricated, which possesses unprecedented [Mn86] nanocage&#8208;based structure and high structure robustness. Attributed to the unique enzyme&#8208;like CO2&#8208;binding pockets, NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a can selectively remove CO2 from CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures with high selectivities.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures has demonstrated great potential for solving energy security and environmental sustainability challenges. However, due to similar physicochemical properties between CO2 and other gases as well as the co&#8208;adsorption behavior, the selectivity of CO2 is severely limited in currently reported CO2&#8208;selective sorbents. To address the challenge, we create a bioinspired design strategy and report a robust, microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with unprecedented [Mn86] nanocages. Attributed to the existence of unique enzyme&#8208;like confined pockets, strong coordination interactions and dipole&#8208;dipole interactions are generated for CO2 molecules, resulting in only CO2 molecules fitting in the pocket while other gas molecules are prohibited. Thus, this MOF can selectively remove CO2 from various gas mixtures and show record&#8208;high selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures. Highly efficient CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 separations are achieved, as verified by experimental breakthrough tests. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of adsorbents with high CO2 selectivity and provides important guidance for designing highly effective adsorbents for gas separation.

A one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation process applied to 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones under borane catalysis with PhSiH3 for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines is presented. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism. The diastereoselectivity was found to originate from a C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines. However, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective access to trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines remains much less explored. Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene with HB(C6F5)2 allows for the one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones with commercially available PhSiH3 to exclusively afford trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, this reaction can be rendered asymmetric by using an enantioenriched borane&#8208;based catalyst derived from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene to give rise to enantioenriched trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with almost complete diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A wide substrate scope, good tolerance of diverse functionality and up to 20&#8208;gram scale production are demonstrated. The enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol are achieved by the judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane. The catalytic pathway and the origin of the excellent stereoselectivity are elucidated by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanodots Can Act as Molecular Catalysts in Chemical and Photochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral carbon nanodots (CNDs) is synthesized through a hydrothermal treatment of molecular precursors. The surface amino functionalities along with the photophysical and redox properties of the material allowed its exploitation as a multifunctional catalytic platform. The CNDs promote enantioselective organocatalytic reactions, photochemical processes and organophotoredox transformations.







Abstract
In this work, a microwave synthesis followed by a simple purification process produces a new type of chiral Carbon Nanodots (CNDs). These CNDs are soluble in organic solvents, exhibit amino groups on their surface and display interesting absorption and emission properties along with mirror image profiles in the electronic circular dichroism spectrum.

     alt="Chiral Carbon Nanodots Can Act as Molecular Catalysts in Chemical and Photochemical Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new type of chiral carbon nanodots (CNDs) is synthesized through a hydrothermal treatment of molecular precursors. The surface amino functionalities along with the photophysical and redox properties of the material allowed its exploitation as a multifunctional catalytic platform. The CNDs promote enantioselective organocatalytic reactions, photochemical processes and organophotoredox transformations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a microwave synthesis followed by a simple purification process produces a new type of chiral Carbon Nanodots (CNDs). These CNDs are soluble in organic solvents, exhibit amino groups on their surface and display interesting absorption and emission properties along with mirror image profiles in the electronic circular dichroism spectrum. All these features set the stage for CNDs to act as multifunctional catalytic platforms, able to promote diverse chemical transformations. In particular, the outer shell composition of CNDs was instrumental to carry out organocatalytic reactions in an enantioselective fashion. In addition, the redox and light-absorbing properties of the material are suitable to drive photochemical processes. Finally, the photoredox and organocatalytic activations of CNDs were exploited at the same time to promote a cross-dehydrogenative coupling. This work demonstrates that CNDs can be used as catalysts to promote multiple reactivities, previously considered exclusive domain of molecular catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Design for Improving Mechanical Stability of Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging electrolyte design, which can construct high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes, is proposed for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. High&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI effectively restricts its fracture and ongoing reactions of electrolytes on lithium metal anodes, which notably improves the stability of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur coin and pouch cells.







Abstract
Practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are severely plagued by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in routine ether electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte with 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (TO) and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) as co&#8208;solvents is proposed to construct a high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI by enriching organic components in Li&#8722;S batteries. The high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI works compatibly in Li&#8722;S batteries. TO with high polymerization capability can preferentially decompose and form organic&#8208;rich SEI, strengthening mechanical stability of SEI, which mitigates crack and regeneration of SEI and reduces the consumption rate of active Li, Li polysulfides, and electrolytes. Meanwhile, DME ensures high specific capacity of S cathodes. Accordingly, the lifespan of Li&#8722;S batteries increases from 75&#8197;cycles in routine ether electrolyte to 216&#8197;cycles in TO&#8208;based electrolyte. Furthermore, a 417&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Li&#8722;S pouch cell undergoes 20&#8197;cycles. This work provides an emerging electrolyte design for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Synthesis and Optoelectronic Applications of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; Conjugated Polymers with a Di&#8208;metallaaromatic Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a di&#8208;metallaaromatic acceptor with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and introduced it to a series of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated metallopolymers using a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology. These metallopolymers can be applied as electron transport layer materials of an organic solar cell, improving the power conversion efficiency considerably.







Abstract
The development of conjugated polymers especially n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. Herein, a strong acceptor building block with di&#8208;metallaaromatic structure was designed and synthesized by connecting two electron&#8208;deficient metallaaromatic units through a &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. Then, a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers. The isolated well&#8208;defined model oligomers indicated polymer structures. Kinetic studies based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopies shed light on the polymerization process. Interestingly, the resulted metallopolymers with d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugations are very promising electron transport layer materials which can boost photovoltaic performance of an organic solar cell, with power conversion efficiency up to 18.28&#8201;% based on the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;EH&#8208;HD&#8208;4F non&#8208;fullerene system. This work not only provides a facile route to construct metallaaromatic conjugated polymers with various functional groups, but also discovers their potential applications for the first time.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents is reported wherein two alkyl&#8208;alkyl bonds are generated in one step.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents. The reaction produces &#947;&#8208;arylated alkanecarbonyl compounds with the generation of two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at the vicinal carbons of alkenes. This reaction is effective for the use of primary, secondary and tertiary &#945;&#8208;halocarboxylic esters, amides and ketones in conjunction with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents as the sources of two C(sp3) carbons for the dialkylation of terminal and cyclic internal alkenes.

         <title>Dimerization of a Reactive Azaacene Diradical: Synthesis of a Covalent Azaacene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of two reactive dicyanomethyl diradicals forms a covalent azaacene cage. In this cascade, four new, elongated &#963;&#8208;CC&#8208;bonds (marked in red) are formed and the internal alkynes transformed into cumulenes. The cage was investigated via several spectroscopy methods at different temperatures, suggesting the reformation of its constituting diradical.







Abstract
Two series of regioisomeric dicyanomethylene substituted dithienodiazatetracenes with formal para&#8208; or ortho&#8208;quinodimethane subunits were synthesized and characterized. Whereas the para&#8208;isomers (p&#8208;n, diradical index y0=0.01) are stable and isolable, the ortho&#8208;isomer (y0=0.98) dimerizes into a covalent azaacene cage. Four elongated &#963;&#8208;CC bonds are formed and the former triisopropylsilyl(TIPS) &#8208;ethynylene groups transformed into cumulene units. The azaacene cage dimer (o&#8208;1)2 was characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis and temperature&#8208;dependent infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, solid&#8208;state), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopies (solution) indicating reformation of o&#8208;1.

         <title>Directly Imaging and Regulating the Nanoscale Inhomogeneity of S&#8208;Vacancies in Molybdenum Disulfide Monolayer during Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of activity of molybdenum disulfide monolayer with potential during hydrogen evolution is observed by opto&#8208;electrochemical imaging. The inhomogeneous spatial distribution of local active sites and uncharged impurities is identified with high sensitivity. The WE, RE and CE represent the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.







Abstract
The study of electron transfer event on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides has attracted tremendous attentions attributing to their promising applications in electrochemical devices. Herein, we demonstrate an opto&#8208;electrochemical strategy to directly map and regulate electron transfer event on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer by combining bright field (BF) imaging technique with electrochemical modulation. The heterogeneity of electrochemical activity on MoS2 monolayer down to nanoscale is resolved spatiotemporally. The thermodynamics of MoS2 monolayer is measured during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the Arrhenius correlations are obtained. We validate that the defect generation engineered by oxygen plasma bombardment dramatically enhances the local electrochemical activity of MoS2 monolayer, which can be attributed to point defects of S&#8208;vacancies as evidenced. Furthermore, by comparing the difference of electron transfer event on MoS2 with various layers, the interlayer coupling effect is uncovered. This study represents a facile method to image the heterogeneity of electrochemical properties for nanomaterials with atomic thickness and regulate the local activity within the plane by extrinsic factors. It also has potential applications in the design and evaluation of high&#8208;performance layered electrochemical systems down to nanoscale.

         <title>Bright Free&#8208;Radical Emission in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole ionic liquids have been used to protect photoinduced radical emissions from carbonyl through electrostatic interactions and spin delocalization effects, with a highest emission efficiency of 53.3&#8201;% achieved. The radical system could be used to build multi&#8208;color and heat&#8208;responsive luminescence materials. They could also be used to detect different amine compounds based on the change in the emission and photoactivation times.







Abstract
It is challenging to achieve stable and efficient radical emissions under ambient conditions. Herein, we present a rational design strategy to protect photoinduced carbonyl free radical emission through electrostatic interaction and spin delocalization effects. The host&#8208;guest system is constructed from tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules and a series of imidazolium ionic liquids as the guest and host, respectively, whereby the carbonyl anion radical emission can be in situ generated under the light irradiation and further stabilized by electrostatic interaction. More importantly, the anion species and the alkyl chain length of imidazolium ionic liquids show a noticeable effect on luminescence efficiency, with the highest radical emission efficiency is as high as 53.3&#8201;% after optimizing the imidazole ionic liquid's structure, which is about four times higher than the polymer&#8208;protected radical system. Theoretical calculations confirm the synergistic effect of strong electrostatic interactions and that the spin delocalization effect significantly stabilizes the radical emission. Moreover, such a radical emission system also could be integrated with a fluorescent dye to induce multi&#8208;color or even white light emission with reversible temperature&#8208;responsive characteristics. The radical emission system can also be used to detect different amine compounds on the basis of the emission changes and photoactivation time.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped Ni0 Systems Featuring Cationic Tetrylenes: Direct Observation of L/Z&#8208;type Ligand Duality, and Alkene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic low&#8208;coordinate tetrylenes are shown to behave as Z&#8208;type ligands towards Ni0, forming rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 complexes. These selectively bind classical N&#8208;bases at EII (E=Ge, Sn), which switches the nature of this ligand centre from Z&#8208; to L&#8208;type, concomitant with a geometry switch at Ni to trigonal planar. T&#8208;shaped systems are active catalysts for alkene hydrogenation, establishing a new class of catalyst for this challenging transformation.







Abstract
We report a facile synthetic method for accessing rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 species, stabilised by low&#8208;coordinate cationic germylene and stannylene ligands which behave as Z&#8208;type ligands toward Ni0. An in&#8208;depth computational analysis indicates significant Nid&#8594;Ep donation (E=Ge, Sn), with essentially no E&#8594;Ni donation. The tetrylene ligand's Lewis acidity can be modulated in situ through the addition of a donor ligand, which selectively binds at the Lewis acidic tetrylene site. This switches this binding centre from a Z&#8208;type to a classical L&#8208;type ligand, with a concomitant geometry switch at Ni0 from T&#8208;shaped to trigonal planar. Exploring the effects of this geometry switch in catalysis, isolated T&#8208;shaped complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c and 4&#8201;a&#8211;c are capable of the hydrogenation of alkenes under mild conditions, whilst the closely related trigonal planar and tetrahedral Ni0 complexes 5, D, and E, which feature L&#8208;type chloro&#8208; or cationic&#8208;tetrylene ligands, are inactive under these conditions. Further, addition of small amounts of N&#8208;bases to the catalytic systems involving T&#8208;shaped complexes significantly reduces turnover rates, giving evidence for the in situ modulation of ligand electronics for catalytic switching.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones via Tandem Allylboration/Lactonization: a Kinetic Resolution Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via a tandem allylboration/lactonization approach was achieved using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex. The kinetic resolution of the allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization was found to be a key aspect responsible for the success of this transformation. Stereodivergent syntheses and total syntheses of eupomatilones 2, 5 and 6 proved its synthetic utility.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motif is a widely encountered unit in many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, a practical and efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones from readily available allylic boronates and benzaldehyde derivatives was developed with chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex as the catalyst. The key success of this transformation was the kinetic resolution of allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization. This protocol enabled to assemble all of four stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials upon variable lactonization. Taking advantage of the current method as the key step, catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of eupomatilones 2, 5, and 6 was accomplished. Control experiments were carried out to probe into the tandem reaction as well as the origin of stereoselectivities.

The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promoted the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process and thus results in a low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite with enriched Al pairs.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;exchanged low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites (Si/Al&#8804;4) synthesized without organic templates are promising candidate catalysts for ammonia selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NH3&#8208;SCR), but their practical application is restricted due to the low hydrothermal stability. Here, inspired by the transcription from duplex DNA to RNA, we synthesized Al pairs enriched low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite (CHA&#8208;SPAEI, Si/Al=3.7) by using silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) featured by strict alternation of &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; tetrahedra as seed. The proportion of Al pairs in CHA&#8722;SPAEI is 78&#8201;%, which is much higher than that in the conventional low&#8208;silica CHA (CHA&#8208;LS, 52&#8201;%). After hydrothermal ageing at 800&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h, Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;SPAEI shows NO conversion above 90&#8201;% within 225&#8211;500&#8201;&#176;C under a gas hourly space velocity of 200,000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much better than that of Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;LS. The spatial close proximity of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is confirmed by the 27Al double&#8208;quantum single&#8208;quantum two&#8208;dimensional NMR analyses. The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8208; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate&#8208;based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.

         <title>Expedient Access to Enantioenriched 1&#8208;Azaspiro Cyclobutanones Enabled by Modified Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a unified strategy for the asymmetric construction of [3,4]&#8208;azaspirocycles by employing the Heyns reactivity upon its electrophilic modification. The chiral phosphoric acid is an efficient catalyst for this transformation and allows to access a wide range of cyclobutanone containing 1&#8208;azaspirocycles with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Leveraging the unexplored regions of chemical space, the integration of spirocyclic cyclobutane in a molecular scaffold opens up a new vista in modern drug discovery. Despite recent advancements in achieving the synthesis of such motifs, strategies for their asymmetric construction have not been well&#8208;recognized and remain a formidable challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have demonstrated a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;azaspiro cyclobutanone enabled by an unusual reactivity of enamine that explore the potentiality of Heyns rearrangement upon electrophilic modification. This design strategy offers viable access to a wide range of cyclobutanone containing spiroindoline and spiropyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, the practicality of this methodology has been shown by a scale&#8208;up synthesis of spirocyclic products and their facile post&#8208;synthetic modifications.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer from Xanthates to Acyl Azoliums: Divergent Ketone Synthesis via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile NHC&#8208;catalyzed method has been developed for synthesizing ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives through SET (single electron transfer) between photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums. This approach further facilitates the generation of structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones by incorporating alkenes and enynes.







Abstract
Considering the prevalence of alcohols and carboxylic acids, their fragment cross&#8208;coupling reactions could hold significant implications in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a versatile method for synthesizing a diverse range of ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums undergo single electron transfer (SET) under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, generating NHC&#8208;derived ketyl radicals and alkyl radicals. These open&#8208;shell intermediates subsequently undergo the radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction, yielding valuable ketones. Furthermore, this approach can be employed in three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and enynes, resulting in structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones. The unified strategy offers a unique opportunity for the fragment coupling of a diverse range of alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives, accommodating diverse functional groups even in complex settings.

         <title>Revealing Active Sites and Reaction Pathways in Methane Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling over Iron&#8208;Containing Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siliceous iron&#8208;containing zeolites were synthesized for methane non&#8208;oxidative coupling. Advanced spectroscopic investigations elucidated the active sites including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores, and revealed the gas&#8208;phase reaction pathways starting from methyl radicals towards (poly)aromatic species.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane is a promising route to obtain ethylene directly from natural gas. We synthesized siliceous [Fe]zeolites with MFI and CHA topologies and found that they display high selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% for MFI and &gt;99&#8201;% for CHA) to ethylene and ethane among gas&#8208;phase products. Deactivated [Fe]zeolites can be regenerated by burning coke in air. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Fe3+ centers in zeolite framework of fresh catalysts are reduced during the reaction to the active sites, including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores. Photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy results show that methyl radicals are the reaction intermediates formed upon methane activation. Ethane is formed by methyl radical coupling, followed by its dehydrogenation to ethylene. Based on the observation of intermediates including allene, vinylacetylene, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, 2&#8208;butyne, and cyclopentadiene over [Fe]MFI, a reaction network is proposed leading to polyaromatic species. Such reaction intermediates are not observed over the small&#8208;pore [Fe]CHA, where ethylene and ethane are the only gas&#8208;phase products.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Gated and Self&#8208;Protected Bioorthogonal Catalyst for Nanozyme&#8208;Assisted Safe Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a self&#8208;protected and responsive bioorthogonal catalyst to achieve efficient and precise intracellular drug synthesis for safe cancer combination therapy. This appealing strategy will promote the development of bioorthogonal catalyst&#8208;mediated novel antineoplastic platforms.







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal uncaging catalysis has sparked increasing interest in prodrug activation. However, due to their &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA&#8208;gated and self&#8208;protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme&#8208;Pd0 with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy. Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities could improve the catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will promote the development of secure and efficient bioorthogonal catalytic systems and provide new insights into novel antineoplastic platforms.

     alt="A DNA-Gated and Self-Protected Bioorthogonal Catalyst for Nanozyme-Assisted Safe Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We described a self-protected and responsive bioorthogonal catalyst to achieve efficient and precise intracellular drug synthesis for safe cancer combination therapy. This appealing strategy will promote the development of bioorthogonal catalyst-mediated novel antineoplastic platforms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal uncaging catalysis has sparked increasing interest in prodrug activation. However, due to their &#8220;always-on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic-detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA-gated and self-protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme-Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy. Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen-doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)-like activities could improve the catalytic-detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will promote the development of secure and efficient bioorthogonal catalytic systems and provide new insights into novel antineoplastic platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Carbazole Building Blocks and &#957;&#8208;DABNA Heteroatom Alignment for a Double Boron&#8208;Embedded MR&#8208;TADF Emitter with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collocating carbazole building blocks with &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment, a novel double boron&#8208;embedded multiple resonance emitter &#928;&#8208;CzBN is obtained and exhibits superior photophysical properties. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on &#928;&#8208;CzBN achieve an exceptional efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a mild roll&#8208;off and a narrow full width at half maximum of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV in the bluish&#8208;green region.







Abstract
Building blocks and heteroatom alignments are two determining factors in designing multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. Carbazole&#8208;fused MR emitters, represented by CzBN derivatives, and the heteroatom alignments of &#957;&#8208;DABNA are two star series of MR&#8208;TADF emitters that show impressive performances from the aspects of building blocks and heteroatom alignments, respectively. Herein, a novel CzBN analog, &#928;&#8208;CzBN, featuring &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment is developed via facile one&#8208;shot lithium&#8208;free borylation. &#928;&#8208;CzBN exhibits superior photophysical properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% and narrowband sky blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm/85&#8197;meV. It also gives efficient TADF properties with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy offset of 40&#8197;meV and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 2.9&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. The optimized OLED using &#928;&#8208;CzBN as the emitter achieves an exceptional external quantum efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 20&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a narrowband emission at 495&#8197;nm with FWHM of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV, making it one of the best reported devices based on MR emitters with comprehensive performance.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Catalysts from Melting Glass&#8208;Forming Cobalt&#8208;Based Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework for Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. A MOF glass catalyst was synthesized via a melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62). Introducing the MOF glass catalyst on various metal oxide semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer constructs the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, and thus improve PEC performance.







Abstract
Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics and serious charge recombination restrict the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving PEC water splitting performance. Herein, a MOF glass catalyst through melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62) was introduced on various metal oxide (MO: Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4) semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer, constructing the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. Owing to the excellent conductivity, stability and open active sites of MOF glass, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes exhibit a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity and stability in comparison to pristine MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and thus improve PEC performance. This MOF glass not only serves as an excellent OER cocatalyst on tunable photoelectrodes, but also enables promising opportunities for PEC devices for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Tandem Guest&#8208;Host&#8208;Receptor Recognitions Precisely Guide Ciprofloxacin to Eliminate Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions was proposed to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to effectively eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M was obtained through guest&#8208;host recognition. After targeting S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected macrophages via ligand&#8208;receptor recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M underwent intracellular caspase&#8208;1&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form ciprofloxacin nanoparticle, leading to enhanced antibacterial efficiency.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) is able to hide within host cells to escape immune clearance and antibiotic action, causing life&#8208;threatening infections. To boost the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics, new intracellular delivery approaches are urgently needed. Herein, by rational design of an adamantane (Ada)&#8208;containing antibiotic&#8208;peptide precursor Ada&#8208;Gly&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Asp&#8208;Cys(StBu)&#8208;Lys(Ciprofloxacin)&#8208;CBT (Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada), we propose a strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Via guest&#8208;host recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada is decorated with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;heptamannoside (CD&#8208;M) derivative to yield Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M, which is able to target mannose receptor&#8208;overexpressing macrophages via multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor recognition. After uptake, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M undergoes caspase&#8208;1 (an overexpressed enzyme during S.&#8197;aureus infection)&#8208;initiated CBT&#8208;Cys click reaction to self&#8208;assemble into ciprofloxacin nanoparticle Nano&#8208;Cip. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that, compared with ciprofloxacin or Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M shows superior intracellular bacteria elimination and inflammation alleviation efficiency in S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected RAW264.7 cells and mouse infection models, respectively. This work provides a supramolecular platform of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide antibiotics to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus infection efficiently.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into the Interlayer Characteristics and Oxygen Reactivity of Bilayer Borophene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was used to study the local chemical properties of bilayer synthetic two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) with atomic&#8208;scale spatial resolution. TERS established the chemical fingerprint of bilayer borophene that is correlated with the vibration of interlayer B&#8722;B bonds and revealed its chemical stability with single&#8208;bond (B&#8722;O) sensitivity by exposure to controlled oxidizing conditions in ultrahigh vacuum.







Abstract
Bilayer (BL) two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) has recently been synthesized and computationally predicted to have promising physical properties for a variety of electronic and energy technologies. However, the fundamental chemical properties of BL borophene that form the foundation of practical applications remain unexplored. Here, we present atomic&#8208;level chemical characterization of BL borophene using ultrahigh vacuum tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV&#8208;TERS). UHV&#8208;TERS identifies the vibrational fingerprint of BL borophene with angstrom&#8208;scale spatial resolution. The observed Raman spectra are directly correlated with the vibrations of interlayer boron&#8211;boron bonds, validating the three&#8208;dimensional lattice geometry of BL borophene. By virtue of the single&#8208;bond sensitivity of UHV&#8208;TERS to oxygen adatoms, we demonstrate the enhanced chemical stability of BL borophene compared to its monolayer counterpart by exposure to controlled oxidizing atmospheres in UHV. In addition to providing fundamental chemical insight into BL borophene, this work establishes UHV&#8208;TERS as a powerful tool to probe interlayer bonding and surface reactivity of low&#8208;dimensional materials at the atomic scale.

         <title>Activation of Bulk Li2S as Cathode Material for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Organochalcogenide&#8208;Based Redox Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of oxidation reaction kinetics of bulk Li2S was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators. Among them, phenyl ditelluride can significantly lower the charge overpotential, accelerate the redox reaction kinetics, and alleviate the shuttle effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides. Consequently, the Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.







Abstract
Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising cathode material for sulfur&#8208;based batteries. However, its activation remains to be one of the key challenges against its commercialization. The extraction of Li+ from bulk Li2S has a high activation energy (Ea) barrier, which is fundamentally responsible for the initial large overpotential. Herein, a systematic investigation of accelerated bulk Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators, in which phenyl ditelluride (PDTe) can significantly reduce the Ea of Li2S and lower the initial charge potential. Simultaneously, it can alleviate the polysulfides shuttling effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides and converting them into insoluble lithium phenyl tellusulfides (PhTe&#8208;SxLi, x&gt;1). This alters the redox pathway and accelerates the reaction kinetics of Li2S cathode. Consequently, the Li||Li2S&#8208;PDTe cell shows excellent rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. The Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <title>Tailoring Extremely Narrow FWHM in Hypsochromic and Bathochromic Shift of Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin MR&#8208;TADF Materials for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic heteraborin multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent scaffolds (NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR) based on role&#8208;play with HOMO energy to achieve the extremely narrow FWHM of 14&#8197;nm were proposed and synthesized via lithium free one&#8208;shot double borylation. The organic light emitting diode employing the NO&#8208;DBMR/Cz&#8208;DBMR manifested state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with high color purity and external quantum efficiency of 29.8/33.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing double boron&#8208;based emitters with extremely narrow band spectrum and high efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is crucial and challenging. Herein, we report two materials, NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, hinge on polycyclic heteraborin skeletons based on role&#8208;play of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The NO&#8208;DBMR contains an oxygen atom, whereas the Cz&#8208;DBMR has a carbazole core in the double boron&#8208;embedded &#957;&#8208;DABNA structure. The synthesized materials resulted in an unsymmetrical pattern for NO&#8208;DBMR and surprisingly a symmetrical pattern for Cz&#8208;DBMR. Consequently, both materials showed extremely narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14&#8197;nm in hypsochromic (pure blue) and bathochromic (Bluish green) shifted emission without losing their high color fidelity. Furthermore, both materials show high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of over 82&#8201;%, and an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.04&#8197;eV, resulting in high reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC) of 105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the fabricated OLEDs based on these heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 33.7 and 29.8&#8201;% for NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow emission spectrum in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.

         <dc:description>
The large shift in luminescent properties between near&#8208;infrared and visible emissions without any loss in quantum yield was achieved by massive structural changes of an organic&#8211;inorganic luminescent hybrid.







Abstract
We synthesized a (1&#8208;propylpyridinium)2[ReN(CN)4]&#8208;type organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid exhibiting water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced drastic structural changes of the [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; assemblies. Specifically, upon exposure to water vapor, dehydrated nitrido&#8208;bridged chains were converted to hydrated cyanido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear clusters via rearrangements of large molecular building units in the crystals. These switchable assembly forms display substantially different photo&#8208;physical properties, although in both cases the emission is caused by a metal&#8208;centered d&#8211;d transition. The nitrido&#8208;bridged chain exhibited a near&#8208;infrared (749&#8197;nm) emission, which blue&#8208;shifted as the temperature increased, while a visible (561&#8197;nm) emission and its red shift was demonstrated by the cyanido&#8208;bridged cluster.

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;Fused Sterically Shielded Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Deep Blue OLEDs with Reduced Dexter Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically shielded yet extremely rigid multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitter (Tp&#8208;DABNA), based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core, has been developed. The bulky fins of the triptycene moieties enable Tp&#8208;DABNA to achieve narrowed emission and reduced Dexter energy transfer while maintaining efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. The corresponding deep blue OLEDs demonstrate a high EQE of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
Designing multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission and suppressed intermolecular interactions is challenging for realizing high color purity and stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a sterically shielded yet extremely rigid emitter based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core (Tp&#8208;DABNA) is proposed to address the issue. Tp&#8208;DABNA exhibits intense deep blue emissions with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a high horizontal transition dipole ratio, superior to the well&#8208;known bulky emitter, t&#8208;DABNA. The rigid MR skeleton of Tp&#8208;DABNA suppresses structural relaxation in the excited state, with reduced contributions from the medium&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrational modes to spectral broadening. The hyperfluorescence (HF) film composed of a sensitizer and Tp&#8208;DABNA shows reduced Dexter energy transfer compared to those of t&#8208;DABNA and DABNA&#8208;1. Notably, deep blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs with the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter display higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax=24.8&#8201;%) and narrower FWHMs (&#8804;26&#8197;nm) than t&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based OLEDs (EQEmax=19.8&#8201;%). The HF&#8208;OLEDs based on the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter further demonstrate improved performance with an EQEmax of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.

         <title>Photonic Modulation Enabled by Controlling the Edge Structures of Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) that were achieved by sequential cyclization. Three as&#8208;synthesized BMCs, featuring the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with controlled edges, display well&#8208;tunable aromatic structures, decreased band gaps and intriguing photonic properties. Notably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits unprecedented stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property.







Abstract
Control over topological edges of molecular carbons (MCs) is of importance for achieving diverse molecular topologies and desirable physical properties. However, it remains very challenging for heteroatom&#8208;doped MCs due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, we report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) via the sequential cyclization strategy. Three BMC molecules that feature the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with selective cove/fjord or cove/bay edges, respectively, were synthesized through the rational combination of Mallory photoreaction and Scholl reaction. We not only obtain the largest boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system reported so far, but also disclose that fine control of their edges and length greatly affects electronic structures and thereby photonic properties of BMCs, such as tunable aromaticity, decreased band gaps, as well as redshifted absorptions and fluorescence. Remarkably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property, both of which have never been reported for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems, thus demonstrating the potential of BMCs as optical gain materials for laser cavities.

         <title>Ruptenes: A Family of Terpene Analogs Give Insight into Cyclisation Mechanisms by Cascade Disruption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpenoid substrate analogs with a saturated C6&#8722;C7 bond were converted with terpene synthases. Their blocked reactivity caused interruption of the cyclisation cascade leading to ruptenes that represent cationic intermediates of the natural cyclisation reaction. Such intermediates are difficult to observe directly and thus the ruptenes deepen our understanding of terpene synthase catalysis.







Abstract
The terpenoid substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GGPP) and (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylfarnesyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP) were synthesised from (S)&#8208;citronellol and enzymatically converted with nine diterpene and two sesterterpene synthases, respectively. In two cases the substrate analogs were converted into diterpenes in cyclisation reactions corresponding to those observed for the native substrate GGPP, while the cyclisation cascade was disrupted or redirected in the other nine cases, leading to products that were named ruptenes. Several of the isolated ruptenes represent deprotonation products of cationic intermediates that are analogs of the intermediates proposed along the cyclisation cascades for the native substrates GGPP or GFPP, thus giving insights into the complex reaction mechanisms of terpene synthase mediated biosynthesis.

         <title>Highly Efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System in Piezo&#8208;catalytic Process for Organic Pollutants Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;cycled Fenton (PSF) system has been constructed. The rapid FeIII/FeII cycle couple with the greatly improved two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production kinetics, providing an exceptional Fenton degradation efficiency far exceeding that of the classical FeII PSF system.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;Fenton (PSF) system has been emerging as a promising technique for wastewater treatment, while the competing O2 reductive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and FeIII reduction seriously limited the reaction kinetics. Here, we develop a two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production (WOR&#8722;H2O2) coupled with FeIII reduction over a FeIII/BiOIO3 piezo&#8208;catalyst for highly efficient PSF. It is found that the presence of FeIII can simultaneously initiate the WOR&#8722;H2O2 and reduction of FeIII to FeII, thereby enabling a rapid reaction kinetics towards subsequent Fenton reaction of H2O2/FeII. The FeIII initiating PSF system offers exceptional self&#8208;recyclable degradation of pollutants with a degradation rate constant for sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) over 3.5 times as that of the classic FeII&#8208;PSF system. This study offers a new perspective for constructing efficient PSF systems and shatters the preconceived notion of FeIII in the Fenton reaction.

         <title>Unprecedented Chiral Three&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylamine, EA=Ethylamine) have been constructed by introducing chiral and achiral cations into the 3D &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic framework. The realization of 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provides a new route for developing chiral materials toward spintronics and chiroptoelectronics applications.







Abstract
Chiral three&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (3D HOIPs) would show unique chiroptoelectronic performance due to the combination of chirality and 3D structure. However, the synthesis of 3D chiral HOIPs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we constructed a pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylammonium, EA=ethylammonium), in which the large chiral cations can be contained in the big &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic frameworks induced by mixing cations. Notably, 3D 1&#8208;R/S shows natural chiroptical activity, as evidenced by its significant mirror circular dichroism spectra and the ability to distinguish circularly polarized light. Moreover, based on the unique 3D structure, 1&#8208;S presents sensitive X&#8208;ray detection performance with a low detection limit of 398&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is 14&#8197;times lower than the regular medical diagnosis of 5.5&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. In this work, 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provide a new route to develop chiral material in spintronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Tailoring Ion Ordering in Perovskite Oxide for High&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the ion ordering of perovskite and high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was investigated in PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948;. It was found that high&#8208;temperature OER activity was enhanced by the A&#8208;site cation ordering but suppressed by the oxygen vacancy ordering.







Abstract
Perovskites exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities as the anodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the relationship between ion ordering and OER performances is rarely investigated. Herein, a series of PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948; perovskites with tailored ion orderings are constructed. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the oxygen bulk migration and surface transport capacities as well as the OER activities are promoted by the A&#8208;site cation ordering, but weakened by the oxygen vacancy ordering. Hence, SOEC with the A&#8208;site&#8208;ordered and oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;disordered PrBaCo2O5+&#948; anode exhibits the highest performance of 3.40&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 2.0&#8197;V. This work sheds light on the critical role of ion orderings in the high&#8208;temperature OER performance and paves a new way for screening novel anode materials of SOECs.

         <title>Conformational Kinetics in Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: A Dynamic P/M Memory Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination between the conformational control of the pendant group in a chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) with the steric hindrance at the poly(diphenylacetylene) main chain results in the selective memorization of either P or M helical senses in the polymer.







Abstract
Dynamic P/M (plus/minus) helical memory in chiral dissymmetric poly(diphenylacetylene)s (PDPA) is shown using a PDPA that bears the benzamide of (L)&#8208;alanine methyl ester as pendant. For a single chiral polymer, it is possible to obtain either P or M helical structures in a specific solvent without the presence of any chiral external stimuli. To do that, it is necessary to combine the conformational control at the pendant group with a high steric hindrance at the backbone. In this case, by thermal annealing in low&#8208;polar solvents, an anti&#8208;conformer is stabilized at the pendant which commands a P helix in the PDPA. Next, solvent removal followed by addition of a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), results in the kinetic conformationally trapped P helix. However, in this medium, the preferred handedness and the thermodynamic macromolecular helix for poly&#8208;(L)&#8208;1 is M. This process also occurs in the opposite way. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) studies show that the dynamic memory effect is present both in ground and excited states.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Transfer Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose: High Monomeric Yield with Switchable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a hydrogen&#8208;transfer reductive catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose. By incorporating a hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride, high yields of aromatic monomers with switchable selectivity are achieved. Choline chloride greatly improves lignin dissolution and tailors the hydrogenolysis of lignin. The proposed strategy promotes the development of targeted lignin valorization and lignin&#8208;first biorefinery.







Abstract
Lignin solubilization and in situ hydrogenolysis are crucial for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulose to aromatic monomers. In this study, we reported a typical hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride (ChCl) to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;donating environment of the Ru/C&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose. The ChCl&#8208;tailored hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose was conducted under mild temperature and low&#8208;pressure (&lt;1&#8197;bar) conditions, which was applicable to other lignocellulosic biomass sources. We obtained an approximate theoretical yield of propylphenol monomer of 59.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 97.3&#8201;% using an optimal content of ChCl (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in ethylene glycol at 190&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h. When the content of ChCl in ethylene glycol was increased to 110&#8197;wt&#8201;%, the selectivity of propylphenol switched toward propylenephenol (yield of 36.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 87.6&#8201;%). The findings in this work provide valuable information for transforming lignin from lignocellulose into value&#8208;added products.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes with pinacolborane is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diboronates. The catalysts are generated in situ from Co(acac)2/dpephos and Co(acac)2/xantphos, respectively. The ring&#8208;opening of arylidenecyclopropanes to form single homoallylic cobalt intermediates via &#946;&#8208;C elimination is crucial for the obtained high regioselectivity.

A variety of arylidenecyclopropanes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to form the corresponding 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;diboronates in high isolated yields and with high regioselectivity. Skipped diboronate products from these reactions can undergo various transformations to allow selective installation of two different functional groups along alkyl chains. Mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions combine cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes and hydroboration of homoallylic or allylic boronate intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;Regiodivergent cobalt-catalyzed ring-opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes with pinacolborane is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,3- and 1,4-diboronates. The catalysts are generated in situ from Co(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/dpephos and Co(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/xantphos, respectively. The ring-opening of arylidenecyclopropanes to form single homoallylic cobalt intermediates via &#946;-C elimination is crucial for the obtained high regioselectivity.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides, generated in situ from 3&#8208;methyleneazetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides was described. A series of chiral quaternary prolineamide derivatives were obtained in excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition.







Abstract
We realized a highly efficient formal [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides generated from 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;azetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides. The employ of readily available chiral cobalt(II) complex of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide enabled the ring&#8208;expansion of azetidines, affording a variety of quaternary prolineamide derivatives with excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition. For the rearrangement of ammonium ylides, the installation of a pyrazoamide group as a masked brick to build chiral scaffolds proved successful. The enantioselective ring expansion process was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Polymeric STING Pro&#8208;agonists for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME), were developed for precision cancer immunotherapy with minimized side effects.







Abstract
The efficacy of combination immunotherapy has been limited by tumor specificity and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs). Herein, we report the development of polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). PSPA is composed of sonosensitizers (semiconducting polymer) and STING agonists (MSA&#8208;2) via the GSH&#8208;activatable linkers. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, PSPA serves as a sonosensitizer to generate 1O2 and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant tumor cells. Furthermore, MSA&#8208;2 is released specifically in tumor microenvironment with highly expressed GSH, minimizing off&#8208;target side effects. The activation of the STING pathway elevates the interferon&#8208;&#946; level and synergizes with SDT to enhance the anti&#8208;tumor response. Therefore, this work proposes a universal approach for spatiotemporal regulation of cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Boron Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation via 1,2&#8208;boron shift to access enantioenriched gem&#8208;diborylalkenes. In this reaction, excellent enantioselectivities were obtained by simply improving the reaction temperature via an impressive DKR process. DFT calculations and extensive mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Asymmetric cross&#8208;couplings based on 1,2&#8208;carbon migration from B&#8208;ate complexes have been developed efficiently to access valuable organoboronates. However, enantioselective reactions triggered by 1,2&#8208;boron shift have remained to be unaddressed synthetic challenge. Here, Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation enabled by 1,2&#8208;boron shift was developed. In this reaction, we disclosed that excellent enantioselectivities were achieved through an interesting dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process of allylic carbonates at the elevated temperature. Notably, the highly valuable (bis&#8208;boryl)alkenes have enabled an array of diversifications to access versatile molecules. Extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism of DKR process and clarify the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stable Hydrogen Production from Water and Lactic Acid via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis in a Porous Microreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term stable H2 production from H2O via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis using lactic acid as a sacrificial reagent and Pt/CdS as a photocatalyst is achieved in a porous microreactor (PP12), with a H2 production rate as high as 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. PP12 can be scaled up to a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2, without a decrease in H2 production efficiency, offering great potential for commercialization.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is significant to overcome challenges like fossil fuel depletion and carbon dioxide emission, but its efficiency is still far below that which is needed for commercialization. Herein, we achieve long&#8208;term stable H2 bubbling production from water (H2O) and lactic acid via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis in a porous microreactor (PP12); the catalytic system benefits from photocatalyst dispersion, charge separation, mass transfer, and dissociation of O&#8722;H bonds associated with H2O. With the widely used platinum/cadmium&#8208;sulfide (Pt/CdS) photocatalyst, PP12 leads to a H2 bubbling production rate of 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 1000&#8197;times higher than that in a traditional reactor. Even when amplifying PP12 into a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2 and extending the reaction time to 100&#8197;h, the H2 bubbling production rate still remains at around 600.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, offering great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Substituent Effect to Fine&#8208;Tune Energy Levels of Atom&#8208;Precise [MoOS3]2&#8722; Modified Copper(I) Thiolate Clusters Boosting Recyclable Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into copper clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters, which show high photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance.







Abstract
The propulsion of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is limited by the rational design and regulation of catalysts with precise structures and excellent activities. In this work, the [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into the CuI clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters of [Cu6(MoOS3)2(C6H5(CH2)S)2(P(C6H4&#8722;R)3)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xCH3CN (R=H, CH3, or F), which show high photocatalytic H2 evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects of the surface ligand, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the resultant visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance. Furthermore, MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters loaded onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 carriers significantly reduced the loss of catalysts in the collection process, efficiently addressing the recycling issues of such small cluster&#8208;based catalyst. This work not only highlights a competitively universal approach on the design of high&#8208;efficiency cluster photocatalysts for energy conversion, but also makes it feasible to manipulate the catalytic performance of clusters through a rational substituent strategy.

         <title>Blending Low&#8208;Frequency Vibrations and Push&#8211;Pull Effects Affords Superior Photoacoustic Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold, which met key requirements of high&#8208;quality PAI.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noninvasive in vivo imaging technique, has been widely used in clinical disease diagnosis. However, the design of high&#8208;performance PAI agents with three key characteristics, i.e., near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (&#955;abs&gt;800&#8197;nm), intense PA signals, and excellent photostability, remains a challenging goal. Herein, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering PAI agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA&#8208;approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; &#955;abs=788&#8197;nm), BDP1&#8208;NEt2 exhibited a UV/Vis&#8208;NIR spectrum peaked at 825&#8197;nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.

The 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocycle oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ) has been synthesized which features a semi&#8208;rigid N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture and is structurally chimeric to crown ethers and porphyrins. o&#8208;TQ has been shown to act as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand and adopt a bowl shape to capture a CuI cation. The copper complex exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission and can be used for supramolecular complexation and catalysis.







Abstract
A new 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocyclic molecular entity, oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ), was designed and synthesized. In o&#8208;TQ, three oxygen atoms were joined onto three quinoline units at the 2&#8208; and 8&#8208;positions in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion by three&#8208;fold SNAr reactions, giving rise to the characteristic N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture. o&#8208;TQ can serve as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand to capture a CuI cation and adopt a bowl shape, before supramolecular complexation with corannulene and [12]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) occurs through &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions. In the presence of the CuI cation, the non&#8208;emissive o&#8208;TQ becomes a highly emissive material in the solid state, whereby the emission wavelengths depend on the ancillary ligand on the CuI cation. The o&#8208;TQ/CuI complex is able to promote carbene catalysis to provide a range of enamines with a gem&#8208;difluorinated terminus.

         <title>Cover Picture: Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 32/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversity in chemical reactivity unfolds even in the gas phase when noncovalent tools such as macrocyclic encapsulation are being used. Two distinct reaction pathways of a&#160;multifunctional bicyclic&#160;azoalkane (bottom) can be chemoselectively activated inside the cavity of a macrocycle (in gold), leading either to ejection of molecular dinitrogen (top) or ethylene (right),&#160;depending on its protonation state. In sharp contrast, the free substrate prefers to eject ammonia upon thermal activation (left), as reported by Werner&#8197;M.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversity in chemical reactivity&lt;/b&gt; unfolds even in the gas phase when noncovalent tools such as macrocyclic encapsulation are being used. Two distinct reaction pathways of a&#160;multifunctional bicyclic&#160;azoalkane (bottom) can be chemoselectively activated inside the cavity of a macrocycle (in gold), leading either to ejection of molecular dinitrogen (top) or ethylene (right),&#160;depending on its protonation state. In sharp contrast, the free substrate prefers to eject ammonia upon thermal activation (left), as reported by Werner&#8197;M. Nau, Elina Kalenius, Tung-Chun Lee et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202303491"&gt;e202303491&lt;/a&gt;).

The unambiguous assignment of NMR signals to complex organic molecules or mixtures is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202304196), Jin&#8197;Wook Cha, Min&#8208;Seon Kim, and Jin&#8208;Soo Park suggest an ultrahigh&#8208;resolution single&#8208;scan NMR method that enables to acquire a hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both 1H, 13C and their correlation spectra. The method was applied to compounds with high NMR signal complexity, such as chromopeptide and diastereomeric mixtures, and resulted in complete 1H and 13C NMR signal assignment of individual subunits and epimers.

O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes of membrane&#8208;bound mucin glycoproteins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. In their Research Article (e202302437), Ulrika Westerlind and co&#8208;workers describe the synthesis of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides using a chemoenzymatic approach. Starting from simple building blocks, Fmoc&#8208;protected glycosylated amino acids were prepared and incorporated into peptides and enzymatically diversified. Bacteria lectin interactions were then elucidated on glycopeptide microarrays.

         <title>The Chemistry of the Cyaphide Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
128&#8197;years after the erroneously assumed synthesis of sodium cyaphide, Na(CP), and 51&#8197;years after the definitive proof of the existence of HCP, the chemistry of the cyaphide anion has finally gained momentum. This review summarizes the chemistry of the cyaphide anion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;, from its beginnings to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art.







Abstract
We review the known chemistry of the cyaphide ion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;. This remarkable diatomic anion has been the subject of study since the late nineteenth century, however its isolation and characterization eluded chemists for almost a hundred years. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore the pioneering synthetic experiments that first allowed for its isolation, as well as more recent developments demonstrating that cyaphide transfer is viable in well&#8208;established salt&#8208;metathesis protocols. The physical properties of the cyaphide ion are also explored in depth, allowing us to compare and contrast the chemistry of this ion with that of its lighter congener cyanide (an archetypal strong field ligand and important organic functional group).

     alt="The Chemistry of the Cyaphide Ion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;128&#8197;years after the erroneously assumed synthesis of sodium cyaphide, Na(CP), and 51&#8197;years after the definitive proof of the existence of HCP, the chemistry of the cyaphide anion has finally gained momentum. This review summarizes the chemistry of the cyaphide anion, (C&#8801;P)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, from its beginnings to the state-of-the art.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review the known chemistry of the cyaphide ion, (C&#8801;P)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This remarkable diatomic anion has been the subject of study since the late nineteenth century, however its isolation and characterization eluded chemists for almost a hundred years. In this mini-review, we explore the pioneering synthetic experiments that first allowed for its isolation, as well as more recent developments demonstrating that cyaphide transfer is viable in well-established salt-metathesis protocols. The physical properties of the cyaphide ion are also explored in depth, allowing us to compare and contrast the chemistry of this ion with that of its lighter congener cyanide (an archetypal strong field ligand and important organic functional group). Recent studies show that the cyaphide ion has the potential to be used as a versatile chemical regent for the synthesis of novel molecules and materials, hinting at many interesting future avenues of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Smart Materials Based on Synthetic Host Molecules: The Role of Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry in the Fabrication and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials that can respond to stimuli have the potential to revolutionize many fields such as the chemical and medical industries. This Minireview summarizes the recent development in smart materials based on synthetic host molecules (SHMs) and their associated host&#8211;guest chemistry. The role of the host&#8211;guest recognition in the material's fabrication and application is highlighted. Understanding the responsiveness of smart materials at the molecular level should empower researchers to design and prepare extremely intelligent systems that can complement the rising demands on automation and robotics.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive or smart materials have recently shown a significant impact on the frontier of material science and engineering. The exponential development of synthetic host molecules (SHMs) over the last decades and their corresponding host&#8211;guest chemistry, have empowered researchers with new opportunities to design and construct tailored or guest&#8208;specific smart materials. In this Minireview, we present the recent advancements in synthetic host based smart materials, ranging from the fabrication strategies to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications including adsorption, separation, luminescence, self&#8208;healing and actuation. The role that the host&#8211;guest chemistry plays in these systems is highlighted throughout to give a better prospective of the available possibilities for emerging materials of future economies.

         <title>Technological Pathways to Produce Compressed and Highly Pure Hydrogen from Solar Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review gives an overview of the technological pathways for direct and indirect production of H2 from solar power within the frame of the Innovation Pool project &#8220; Solar H2: Highly Pure and Compressed &#8221;. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal and plasma reactors are described in terms of their principle of operation and specifics regarding to the quality (purity, pressure) of produced H2.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) produced from renewables will have a growing impact on the global energy dynamics towards sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral standards. The share of green H2 is still too low to meet the net&#8208;zero target, while the demand for high&#8208;quality hydrogen continues to rise. These factors amplify the need for economically viable H2 generation technologies. The present article aims at evaluating the existing technologies for high&#8208;quality H2 production based on solar energy. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal reactors and plasma conversion utilize solar power directly or indirectly (as carbon&#8208;neutral electrons) and are reviewed from the perspective of their current development level, technical limitations and future potential.

         <title>Achieving White&#8208;Light Emission Using Organic Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be realized by purely organic phosphorescent emitters using either single&#8208;component or host&#8208;guest systems by mixing two fundamental colors (blue and yellow) or three primary colors (blue, green and red). Here we describe current strategies for achieving white phosphorescence at room&#8208;temperature using organic emitters.







Abstract
Artificial lighting currently consumes approximately one&#8208;fifth of global electricity production. Organic emitters with white persistent RTP have potential for applications in energy&#8208;efficient lighting technologies, due to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. Compared to heavy metal phosphorescent materials, they have significant advantages in cost, processability, and reduced toxicity. Phosphorescence efficiency can be improved by introducing heteroatoms, heavy atoms, or by incorporating luminophores within a rigid matrix. White&#8208;light emission can be achieved by tuning the ratio of fluorescence to phosphorescence intensity or by pure phosphorescence with a broad emission spectrum. This review summarizes recent advances in the design of purely organic RTP materials with white&#8208;light emission, describing single&#8208;component and host&#8208;guest systems. White phosphorescent carbon dots and representative applications of white&#8208;light RTP materials are also introduced.

         <title>Copper (I)&#8208;BOX Catalyzed Asymmetric 3&#8208;Component Reaction for the Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Propargylic Ethers and Anilines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of trifluoromethylated propargylic ethers and amines is described. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity using a simple chiral CuI&#8208;BOX system and tolerates a broad range of alcohol, aniline and alkyne substitution. With chiral alcohols, a high diastereoselectivity is observed, indicating good catalyst stereocontrol.







Abstract
An asymmetric 3&#8208;component reaction between EthynylBenziodoXoles (EBXs), 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane and nucleophiles catalyzed by a CuI&#8208;BOX (Bisoxazoline) catalyst is described. This protocol gives access to chiral trifluoromethylated propargyl ethers and anilines, which are valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity and yield with different nucleophiles such as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, as well as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor anilines. Aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes can be successfully introduced as electrophiles. In case of chiral substrates, high catalyst control was observed, leading to good diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Dihydrogen and Ethylene Activation by a Sterically Distorted Distibene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a hindered and highly distorted distibene complex capable of reacting with H2 and ethylene. NMR studies point to a feasible dissociation of the dimeric species into a fleeting stibinidene intermediate, which rapidly engages in reactivity. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity for SbI compounds provides crucial understanding towards the putative Sb redox catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a sterically distorted distibene ([4]2) and its transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity towards two fundamental feedstock chemicals: H2 and ethylene. Although [4]2 exhibits an unusually long Sb=Sb distance and noticeable backbone distortion in the solid state, NMR data suggest that [4]2 remains predominantly as a dimer in solution, even at high temperatures. However, it was proposed that the elusive reactivity of [4]2 toward H2 and ethylene results from reversible dissociation of [4]2 into the transient stibinidene ([4]), which could be observed by NMR spectroscopic techniques.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a hindered and highly distorted distibene complex capable of reacting with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ethylene. NMR studies point to a feasible dissociation of the dimeric species into a fleeting stibinidene intermediate, which rapidly engages in reactivity. Such transition-metal-like reactivity for Sb&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; compounds provides crucial understanding towards the putative Sb redox catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the synthesis of a sterically distorted distibene (&lt;b&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and its transition-metal-like reactivity towards two fundamental feedstock chemicals: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ethylene. Although &lt;b&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an unusually long Sb=Sb distance and noticeable backbone distortion in the solid state, NMR data suggest that &lt;b&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; remains predominantly as a dimer in solution, even at high temperatures. However, it was proposed that the elusive reactivity of &lt;b&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; toward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ethylene results from reversible dissociation of &lt;b&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; into the transient stibinidene (&lt;b&gt;[4]&lt;/b&gt;), which could be observed by NMR spectroscopic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Nitromethane to Construct Isoxazoline Aldoximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented approach to isoxazoline aldoximes via the reactions of nitromethane and olefins is achieved. Nitromethane is electrochemically activated to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes.







Abstract
Activation of nitromethane to endow new reactivity is an interesting and meaningful but also challenging topic. Herein, we report an electrochemical activation of nitromethane to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes. The isoxazoline aldoximes that are prepared by four steps with the reported strategy are synthesized in a single step from low&#8208;cost and readily available nitromethane and olefins with moderate to excellent yields under our electrochemical conditions. The reaction also takes advantage of high atom&#8208;economy and E&#8208;selectivity. Moreover, the mechanism is studied by control experiments, a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study, cyclic voltammogram (CV) experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanistic results reveal that nitromethane may be activated under electrochemical conditions to deliver a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole 2&#8208;oxide intermediate, which undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with olefins to yield isoxazoline aldoximes.

         <title>Synthetic Modulation of an Unstable Dehydrosecodine&#8208;type Intermediate and Its Encapsulation into a Confined Cavity Enable Its X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Observation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a labile dehydrosecodine&#8208;type intermediate was achieved by designing a functionally modulated analogue, enabling its inclusion within a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage. The unique folded conformation of this intermediate, stabilized inside the hydrophobic cavity, was supported by DFT calculations and supports the postulation of its involvement in divergent metabolic pathways to various monoterpene indole alkaloids.







Abstract
Numerous indole alkaloids such as the iboga&#8208; and aspidosperma&#8208;type are believed to be biosynthesized via a common hypothetical intermediate, dehydrosecodine. The highly reactive nature of dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compounds has hampered their isolation and structural elucidation. In this study, we achieved the first X&#8208;ray structural determination of a dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compound by integrating synthetic optimization of the reactivity and stabilizing the fragile molecule by encapsulation into a supramolecular host. Formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex of the dehydrosecodine&#8208;type labile guest bearing both vinyl indole and dihydropyridine units with the host was observed. This integrated approach not only provides insights into the biosynthetic conversions but also allows stabilization and storage of the reactive and otherwise short&#8208;lived intermediate within the confined hydrophobic cavity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Thiamyxins A&#8211;C and Thiamyxin E, a Potent Class of RNA&#8208;Virus&#8208;Inhibiting (Cyclo)depsipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first total synthesis of thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and E, an interesting group of natural products with antiviral activity and an acid&#8208;labile C2 exomethine position, is described. Overcoming the problem of inseparable diastereomers of the open&#8208;chain variants, thiamyxin&#8197;C and E were obtained by opening the cyclic thiamyxins&#8197;A and B.







Abstract
We present the first total synthesis of the thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and the now fully characterized thiamyxin&#8197;E, an interesting class of thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich depsipeptides with diverse antiviral activity. The synthesis features a parallel closing of two methyl thiazoline units, with low epimerization of the very labile adjacent stereocenter. It also includes the three&#8208;step synthesis of an uncommon hydroxy acid and the oxidation&#8208;free elimination of a phenylselenide to form a dehydroalanine moiety. The exploitation of the acid&#8208;labile stereocenter at the isoleucine moiety and the reopening of the macrolactones gave access to the four thiamyxins with good yields and diastereomeric purities from a single precursor. The modular total synthesis allows further testing of the biological activity and gives opportunities to explore the pharmacophore and antiviral target through derivatization.

         <title>Observation of Confinement&#8208;Free Neutral Group Three Transition Metal Carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl Sc(CO)7 and octacarbonyl TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) complexes have been prepared using a laser vaporization&#8208;supersonic expansion source and characterized by size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy. Theoretical analyses show that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase.







Abstract
Spectroscopic characterization of neutral highly&#8208;coordinated compounds is essential in fundamental and applied research, but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in mass selection. Here, we report the preparation and size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet (IR&#8208;VUV) spectroscopic identification of group&#8208;3 transition metal carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) in the gas phase, which are the first confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes. The results indicate that Sc(CO)7 has a C2v structure and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) have a D4h structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. These highly&#8208;coordinated carbonyls are 17&#8208;electron complexes when only those valence electrons that occupy metal&#8722;CO bonding orbitals are considered, in which the ligand&#8208;only 4b1u molecular orbital is ignored. This work opens new avenues toward the design and chemical control of a large variety of compounds with unique structures and properties.

         <title>Photosensitized [4+2]&#8208; and [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of N&#8208;Sulfonylimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions and azetidine&#8208;forming [2+2] cycloadditions (aza&#8208;Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions) of sulfonylimines are presented. The divergent reactivity was achieved though substrate modulation. In both cases, the reactions lead to the synthesis of complex polycyclic scaffolds from simple components. The mechanistic details and the utility of the products are described.







Abstract
The synthesis of polycyclic compounds is of high interest due to the prevalence of these motifs in drugs and natural products. Herein, we report on the stereoselective construction of 3D bicyclic scaffolds and azetidine derivatives by modulation of N&#8208;sulfonylimines to achieve either [4+2]&#8208; or [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. The utility of the method was established by further modulation of the product. Mechanistic studies are also included, which support reaction via Dexter energy transfer.

         <title>Direct Observation of the Ethyl Radical in the Pyrolysis of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We directly detect the ethyl radical intermediate in ethane pyrolysis for the first time, and reveal new insights into the reaction mechanism based upon our observations. This advance was enabled by a combination of isotopic microreactor studies, master equation based kinetics calculations, and threshold photoelectron&#8208;photoion coincidence spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report the first direct detection of ethyl radical in the pyrolysis of ethane. Observation of this vital intermediate was made possible in this extremely reactive environment by the use of a microreactor coupled with synchrotron radiation and photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy, despite its short lifetime and low concentration. Together with ab&#8208;initio master equation&#8208;calculated rates and fully coupled computational fluid dynamics simulations, our measurements show that even under the low pressures and short residence times in our experiment, ethyl formation can only be explained by bimolecular reactions; the most important is the catalytic attack of ethane by H atoms, which are then regenerated by decomposition of the nascent ethyl radicals. Our results complete the observation of all hypothesized intermediates in this industrially important process and highlight the need for further studies under additional conditions using similar methods to improve existing models and optimize process chemistries.

         <title>Elusive Double Perovskite Iodides: Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unicorn double perovskite iodides [A2MIMIIII6] are elusive, but with the help of rational design rules, can indeed be synthesized. The Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy) family demonstrate optical properties that are red shifted compared to related halide materials and their magnetic properties show weak interaction parameters.







Abstract
Halide double perovskites [A2MIMIIIX6] are an important class of materials that have garnered substantial interest as non&#8208;toxic alternatives to conventional lead iodide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. While numerous studies have examined chloride and bromide double perovskites, reports of iodide double perovskites are rare, and their definitive structural characterization has not been reported. Predictive models have aided us here in the synthesis and characterization of five iodide double perovskites of general formula Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy). The complete crystal structures, structural phase transitions, optical, photoluminescent, and magnetic properties of these compounds are reported.

         <title>Preparation and Reactivity Study of a Versatile Trifluoromethylthiolating Agent: S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Trifluoromethanesulfonothioate (TTST)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel CF3S reagent named TTST has been prepared in one step using commercially inexpensive materials. TTST is easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, highly reactive, and can be used to prepare many CF3S reagents. TTST can generate one CF3S+, two CF3S&#8722;, or both CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. TTST exhibits high atom economy&#8211;all atoms except the oxygens can be used. TTST enabled to reach a new type of molecule, ArOSCF3, and revealed a novel catalytic CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement.







Abstract
A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF3SO2SCF3 (1), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF3SO2Na and Tf2O. 1 is a highly versatile and atom&#8208;efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF3S+, two equivalents of CF3S&#8722;, or a combination of CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. Many high&#8208;yielding CF3S reactions of C, O, S, and N&#8208;nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple&#8208;step preparations of many reported CF3S reagents. 1 delivered a hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize ArOSCF3 that was followed by a novel CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph3P combinations, 1 generated two equivalents of CF3S anion species, and the photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenes with 1 provided CF3/CF3S&#8208;containing products in high atom&#8208;efficiency.

         <title>A General Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalytic Platform for the Activation of Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with light, can activate via single electron reduction a wide variety of typically inert electron&#8208;rich substrates, including strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The protocol is also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates, exhibiting high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Due to their strong covalent bonds and low reduction potentials, activating inert substrates is challenging. Recent advances in photoredox catalysis offered a number of solutions, each of which useful for activating specific inert bonds. Developing a general catalytic platform that can consistently target a broad range of inert substrates would be synthetically useful. Herein, we report a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with 405&#8197;nm light, acquires a strongly reducing power. This excited&#8208;state reactivity served to activate, by single&#8208;electron reduction, strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic platform was versatile enough to promote the reduction of generally recalcitrant electron&#8208;rich substrates (Ered&lt;&#8722;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE), including arenes that afforded 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. The protocol was also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates with a high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies identified an excited&#8208;state thiolate anion as responsible of the highly reducing reactivity.

This excited-state reactivity served to activate, by single-electron reduction, strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic platform was versatile enough to promote the reduction of generally recalcitrant electron-rich substrates (E&lt;sub&gt;red&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;&#8722;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE), including arenes that afforded 1,4-cyclohexadienes. The protocol was also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates with a high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies identified an excited-state thiolate anion as responsible of the highly reducing reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Amide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a protocol for the reduction of amides to amines using a cationic BiIII catalyst with a tridentate ligand framework in combination with a simple and cheap silane as the reducing agent. Various amides can be reduced and a variety of functional groups can be tolerated. Kinetic analyses and modelling were used to elucidate the orders of each component and to generate a kinetic model that is in agreement with the observed experimental data.







Abstract
In this article we report that a cationic version of Akiba's BiIII complex catalyzes the reduction of amides to amines using silane as hydride donor. The catalytic system features low catalyst loadings and mild conditions, en route to secondary and tertiary aryl&#8208; and alkylamines. The system tolerates functional groups such as alkene, ester, nitrile, furan and thiophene. Kinetic studies on the reaction mechanism result in the identification of a reaction network with an important product inhibition that is in agreement with the experimental reaction profiles.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes with Internal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes and internal olefins has been developed, providing a wide range of multisubstituted gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes. This reaction shows an example where the &#8220;CF2&#8221; motif can be kept upon ring extension. The process is atom&#8208;economic and allows to reach numerous gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules represents a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) and internal olefins has been developed, enabling the efficient synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good functional group compatibility, excellent regioselectivity and good diastereoselectivity. The resulting gem&#8208;difluorinated products can undergo downstream transformations to access various mono&#8208;fluorinated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This reaction demonstrates the use of gem&#8208;DFCPs as a type of &#8220;CF2&#8221; C3 synthon for cycloaddition under transition metal catalysis, which provides potential strategy for synthesizing other gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules.

         <title>A Divergent Polyene Cyclization for the Total Synthesis of Greenwayodendrines, Greenwaylactams, Polysin and Polyveoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of nine alkaloid sesquiterpenoids has been accomplished in only 5&#8211;8&#8197;steps in excellent overall yield (3&#8211;21&#8201;%). The dual nucleophilicity of the indole enabled two divergent termination pathways to be unlocked: an unprecedented N&#8208;termination and a previously challenging C&#8208;termination step. Furthermore, a bioinspired late&#8208;stage Witkop oxidation enabled the first total synthesis of greenwaylactams A&#8722;C.







Abstract
We present a concise asymmetric total synthesis (5&#8211;8&#8197;steps) of nine sesquiterpenoid alkaloids featuring four different tetra&#8208;/pentacyclic scaffolds. To this end, a novel, bioinspired indole N&#8208;terminated cationic tricyclization has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of greenwayodendrines and polysin. Subtle variation of the C2&#8208;substituted indole cyclization precursor allowed switching between indole N&#8208; and C&#8208;termination. For the latter, a subsequent Witkop oxidation enabled conversion of the cyclopentene&#8208;fused indole into the eight&#8208;membered benzolactam to directly furnish the family of greenwaylactams. In addition, a diastereomeric C&#8208;termination product has been elaborated to provide access to polyveoline.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the scientists in the Highly Operational Team (HOT) led by the Shustova group from the University of South Carolina (USA). HOT researchers are located at four universities (the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, the University of Florida, and Chulalongkorn University) and one national laboratory (Savannah River National Laboratory) from two different countries, USA and Thailand. The team recently published an article using the synergy among the HOT participants to reveal the synthetic pathways toward preparation of transuranic heterometallic extended metal&#8211;organic materials, providing mechanistic details for their formation, and establishing a structure&#8211;property relationship: &#8220;f&#8208;block MOFs: A Pathway to Heterometallic Transuranics&#8221;, K.&#8197;C.

         <title>A Radical Pathway and Stabilized Li Anode Enabled by Halide Quaternary Ammonium Electrolyte Additives for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of the sulfur cathode by insulating lithium sulfide restricts the reversibility and sulfur utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. 3D nucleation of Li2S enabled by radical conversion may significantly boost the redox kinetics. Electrolytes with high donor number (DN) solvents allow for tri&#8208;sulfur (S3&#8226;&#8722;) radicals as intermediates, however, the catastrophic reactivity of such solvents with Li anodes pose a great challenge for their practical application. Here, we propose the use of quaternary ammonium salts as electrolyte additives, which can preserve the partial high&#8208;DN characteristics that trigger the S3&#8226;&#8722; radical pathway, and inhibit the growth of Li dendrites. Li&#8208;S batteries with tetrapropylammonium bromide (T3Br) electrolyte additive deliver the outstanding cycling stability (700 cycles at 1 C with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle), and high capacity under a lean electrolyte of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1. This work opens a new avenue for the development of electrolyte additives for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Steric Hindrance of Porous Organic Polymers in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes to Induce the Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium fluoride (LiF) at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) contributes to the stable operation of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Currently, most of the methods for constructing lithium fluoride SEI are based on the design of polar groups of fillers. However, the mechanism behind how steric hindrance of fillers impacts LiF formation remains unclear. This study synthesizes three kinds of porous polyacetal amides (PAN&#8208;X, X=NH2, NH&#8208;CH3, N&#8208;(CH3)2) with varying steric hindrances by regulating the number of methyl substitutions of nitrogen atoms on the reaction monomer, which are incorporated into polymer composite solid electrolytes, to investigate the regulation mechanism of steric hindrance on the content of lithium fluoride in SEI. The results show that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8208;) will compete for the charge without steric effect, while excessive steric hindrance hinders the interaction between TFSI&#8208; and polar groups, reducing charge acquisition. Only when one hydrogen atom on the amino group is replaced by a methyl group, steric hindrance from the methyl group prevents TFSI&#8208; from capturing charge in that direction, thereby facilitating the transfer of charge from the polar group to a separate TFSI&#8208; and promoting maximum LiF formation. This work provides a novel perspective on constructing LiF&#8208;rich SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report for the first time that Pd nanocrystals can absorb H via a &#8220;single&#8208;phase pathway&#8221; when particles with a proper combination of shape and size are used. Specifically, when Pd icosahedral nanocrystals of 7&#8208; and 12&#8208;nm in size are exposed to H atoms, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide each particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of phase boundaries is no longer favored. As such, absorption of H atoms is dominated by the single&#8208;phase pathway and one can readily obtain PdHx with any x in the range of 0&#8722;0.7. When switched to Pd octahedral nanocrystals, the single&#8208;phase pathway is only observed for particles of 7 nm in size. We also establish that the H&#8208;absorption kinetics will be accelerated if there is a tensile strain in the nanocrystals due to the increase in lattice spacing. Besides the unique H&#8208;absorption behaviors, the PdHx (x = 0&#8211;0.7) icosahedral nanocrystals show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward the formic acid oxidation because of the decrease in chemical potential for H atoms in a Pd lattice under tensile strain.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Photochromic&#8208;Photothermal Processes for Catalytic Plastic Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating high&#8208;energy ultraviolet (UV) photons into photothermal catalytic processes may enable photothermal&#8208;photochemical synergistic catalysis, which represents a transformative technology for waste plastic recycling. The major challenge is avoiding side reactions and by&#8208;products caused by these energetic photons. Here, we break through the limitation of the existing photothermal conversion mechanism and propose a photochromic&#8208;photothermal catalytic system based on polyol&#8208;ligated TiO2 nanocrystals. Upon UV or sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols can rapidly capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. The resulting abundant defect energy levels boost sunlight&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, and simultaneously the oxygen vacancies facilitate polyester glycolysis by activating the nucleophilic addition&#8208;elimination process. As a result, compared to commercial TiO2 (P25), we achieve 6&#8208;fold and 12.2&#8208;fold performance enhancements under thermal and photothermal conditions, respectively, while maintaining high selectivity to high&#8208;valued monomers. This paradigm&#8208;shift strategy directs energetic UV photons for activating catalysts and avoids their interaction with reactants, opening the possibility of substantially elevating the efficiency of more solar&#8208;driven catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic &#946;&#8208;Scission of C&#8211;H and C&#173;&#8211;C Bonds for Selective Dimerization and Subsequent Sulfur&#8208;Free RAFT Polymerization of &#945;&#8208;Methylstyrene and Isobutylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds ((CH3)2C(PhY)&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)PhY) were prepared by selective cationic dimerization of &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene (&#945;MS) derivatives (CH2=C(CH3)PhY) with p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) via &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H scision. They were subsequently used as reversible chain transfer agents for sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization of &#945;MS via &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;C scission in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts such as SnCl4. In particular, exo&#8208;olefin compounds with electron&#8208;donating substituents, such as a 4&#8208;MeO group (Y) on the aromatic ring, worked as efficient cationic RAFT agents for &#945;MS to produce poly(&#945;MS) with controlled molecular weights and exo&#8208;olefin terminals. Other exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)(4&#8208;MeOPh)) with various R groups were prepared by different methods to examine the effects of R groups on the cationic RAFT polymerization. A sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization also proceeded for isobutylene (IB) with the exo&#8208;olefin &#945;MS dimer ((CH3)2C(Ph)&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)Ph). Furthermore, telechelic poly(IB) with exo&#8208;olefins at both terminals was obtained with a bifunctional RAFT agent containing two exo&#8208;olefins. Finally, block copolymers of &#945;MS and MMA were prepared via mechanistic transformation from cationic to radical RAFT polymerization using exo&#8208;olefin terminals containing 4&#8208;MeOPh groups as common sulfur&#8208;free RAFT groups for both cationic and radical polymerizations.</dc:description>

In particular, exo-olefin compounds with electron-donating substituents, such as a 4-MeO group (Y) on the aromatic ring, worked as efficient cationic RAFT agents for &#945;MS to produce poly(&#945;MS) with controlled molecular weights and exo-olefin terminals. Other exo-olefin compounds (R&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)(4-MeOPh)) with various R groups were prepared by different methods to examine the effects of R groups on the cationic RAFT polymerization. A sulfur-free cationic RAFT polymerization also proceeded for isobutylene (IB) with the exo-olefin &#945;MS dimer ((CH3)2C(Ph)&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)Ph). Furthermore, telechelic poly(IB) with exo-olefins at both terminals was obtained with a bifunctional RAFT agent containing two exo-olefins. Finally, block copolymers of &#945;MS and MMA were prepared via mechanistic transformation from cationic to radical RAFT polymerization using exo-olefin terminals containing 4-MeOPh groups as common sulfur-free RAFT groups for both cationic and radical polymerizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coupling in Anti&#8208;Perovskite Nitride via Cation Doping for Efficient Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complexes of metal center and nitrogen ligands are the most representative systems for catalyzing hydrogenation reactions in small molecule conversion. Developing heterogenous catalysts with similar active metal&#8208;nitrogen functional centers, nevertheless, still remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that the metal&#8208;nitrogen coupling in anti&#8208;perovskite Co4N can be effective modulated by Cu doping to form Co3CuN, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation process during electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;RR) to ammonia. The combination of advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that Cu dopants strengthen the Co&#8208;N bond and upshifted the metal d&#8208;band towards the Fermi level, promoting the adsorption of NO3&#8208; and *H and facilitating the transition from *NO2/*NO to *NO2H/*NOH. Consequently, the Co3CuN delivers noticeably better NO3&#8208;RR activity than the pristine Co4N, with optimal Faradaic efficiency of 97% and ammonia yield of 455.3 mmol h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance heterogenous catalyst for electrochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective 1,4&#8208;Oxyamination of Conjugated gem&#8208;Difluorodienes via Coupling with Carboxylic Acids and Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes afforded 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives in excellent 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeded via rhodium(III) catalysis through an &#951;3&#8208;allyl intermediate.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine atoms in organics improves their bioactivity and lipophilicity. Catalytic functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorodienes represents one of the most straightforward approaches to access fluorinated alkenes. In contrast to the regular 1,3&#8208;dienes that undergo diverse asymmetric di/hydrofunctionalizations, the regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes remains untouched. Herein, we report asymmetric 1,4&#8208;oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodiene by chiral rhodium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling with readily available carboxylic acid and dioxazolone, affording gem&#8208;difluorinated 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives. Our asymmetric protocol exhibits high 1,4&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Stoichiometric experiments provide evidences for the &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium pathway. Related oxyamination was also realized when trifluoroethanol was used as an oxygen nucleophile.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Difluoromethylation&#8208;Alkynylation of Olefins by Solving the Dilemma between Acidities and Reduction Potentials of Difluoromethylating Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and substituent constants (&#963;) of aryl difluoromethyl sulfones provides a powerful strategy to solve the dilemma of acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. The strategy enabled achieving enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation reactions of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone.







Abstract
Molecules containing a difluoromethyl group or a propargylic stereocenter are widely used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and 1,2&#8208;functionalization of olefins is an important method for introducing the two groups into molecules simultaneously. The construction of the propargylic stereocenter with terminal alkynes usually requires bases. However, difluoromethylating agents with high reduction potentials often decompose in the presence of bases because of their acidities, and those with low reduction potentials are stable but difficult to undergo the desired single electron transfer (SET) reduction. Using the linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and Hammett substituent constants (&#963;) of difluoromethyl aryl sulfones, we solved the dilemma between acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. Herein, we report the first enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone with high enantioselectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). We also extended this asymmetric fluoroalkylation&#8208;alkynylation reaction with other fluoroalkyl sulfones, which enabled efficient installation of trifluoromethyl, difluoroalkyl, difluorobenzyl, (benzenesulfonyl)&#8208;difluoromethyl and monofluoromethyl groups into products.

         <title>Unlocking Reversible Silicon Redox for High&#8208;Performing Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible Si redox has been unlocked in Cl&#8208;based batteries through rational electrolyte dilution and anode passivation, which demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and high practicability. It enables us to revisit the overlooked Cl&#8208;based batteries and to harness them for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage.







Abstract
Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;based batteries such as Li/Cl2 batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl&#8208;based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well&#8208;documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl&#8208;based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl&#8208;based batteries.

     alt="Unlocking Reversible Silicon Redox for High-Performing Chlorine Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversible Si redox has been unlocked in Cl-based batteries through rational electrolyte dilution and anode passivation, which demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and high practicability. It enables us to revisit the overlooked Cl-based batteries and to harness them for sustainable and high-performance energy storage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorine (Cl)-based batteries such as Li/Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl-based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well-documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl-based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl-based batteries. Here we show, for the first time, reversible Si redox in Cl-based batteries through efficient electrolyte dilution and anode/electrolyte interface passivation using 1,2-dichloroethane and cyclized polyacrylonitrile as key mediators. Our Si anode chemistry enables significantly increased cycling stability and shelf lives compared with conventional Li metal anodes. It also avoids the use of a large excess of anode materials, thus enabling the first rechargeable Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full battery with remarkable energy and power densities of 809&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4,277&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The Si anode chemistry affords fast kinetics with remarkable rate capability and low-temperature electrochemical performance, indicating its great potential in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity as Solid Ion Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes based on polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) are proposed as ideal solid electrolytes for lithium batteries. Benefiting from rational material selection and structure design, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries deliver high discharge specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and prolonged cycling life (247&#8197;cycles). The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries can operate steadily for over 100&#8197;cycles after a series of abuse tests (bending and twisting).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity and superior stability are considered to be a key technology for the safe operation of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, current SSEs are incapable of meeting the requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here we report a general strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance SSEs by engineering polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs). Taking advantage of the interconnected ion pathways generated from the ionizable groups, high ionic conductivity (1.06&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) is achieved for the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs. The mechanically strong (50.0&#8197;MPa) and non&#8208;flammable SSEs combine the two superiorities of outstanding Li+ conductivity and electrochemical stability, which can restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short&#8208;circuiting even after more than 2200&#8197;h cycling. Benefiting from the rational design of SSEs, PIMs&#8208;based SSEs Li&#8208;metal batteries can achieve good cycling performance and superior feasibility in a series of withstand abuse tests including bending, cutting, and penetration. Moreover, the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs endow high specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (247&#8197;cycles) for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The PIMs&#8208;based SSEs present a powerful strategy for enabling safe operation of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C(sp2)&#8722;F Bond Alkylation of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefin HFO&#8208;1234yf</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of inexpensive industrial chemical HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents has been developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the less electron&#8208;rich pyridine&#8208;oxazoline or bipyridine&#8208;based ligands feature comparable or even higher rates of C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands in the presence of lithium bromide.







Abstract
The selective transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization of inexpensive industrial fluorochemicals represents one of the most attractive approaches to valuable fluorinated compounds. However, the selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond carbofunctionalization of refrigerant hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) remains challenging. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents. The resulting 2&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes can serve as a versatile synthon for diversified transformations, including the anti&#8208;Markovnikov type hydroalkylation and the synthesis of bioactive molecule analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that lithium salt is essential to promote the oxidative addition of Ni0(Ln) to the C&#8722;F bond; the less electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;based ligands, such as bipyridine and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, feature comparable or even higher oxidative addition rates than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands; the strong &#963;&#8208;donating phosphine ligands, such as PMe3, are detrimental to transmetallation, but the less electron&#8208;rich and bulky N&#8208;based ligands, such as pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, facilitate transmetallation and reductive elimination to form the final product.

         <title>From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions through Fragment Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linked fragments for molecular glue development for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are described. Two classes of fragments were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule that was further optimized, guided by 20 crystal structures, resulting in a selective 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; PPIs.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule stabilization of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy in chemical biology and drug discovery. However, the systematic discovery of PPI stabilizers remains a largely unmet challenge. Herein we report a fragment&#8208;linking approach targeting the interface of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and a peptide derived from the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) protein. Two classes of fragments&#8212;a covalent and a noncovalent fragment&#8212;were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule in which the original fragment interactions were largely conserved. Supported by 20 crystal structures, this initial hybrid molecule was further optimized, resulting in selective, 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; interaction. The high&#8208;resolution structures of both the single fragments, their co&#8208;crystal structures and those of the linked fragments document a feasible strategy to develop orthosteric PPI stabilizers by linking to an initial tethered fragment.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Responsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Capsule Displaying Unusual Encapsulation&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative assembly of bent amphiphiles with two ferrocene units leads to a ferrocene&#8208;based capsule in water. Besides redox&#8208;responsive disassembly/assembly properties, the new capsule displays unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions upon encapsulation of electron&#8208;accepting molecules in the multi&#8208;ferrocene cavity. The CT interactions are facilely dissociated by a redox&#8208;triggered stimulus.







Abstract
A ferrocene&#8208;based capsule is spontaneously and quantitatively formed in water by the assembly of bent amphiphiles carrying two ferrocene units. The disassembly and assembly of the new organometallic capsule, with a well&#8208;defined and highly condensed ferrocene core, are demonstrated by chemical redox stimuli in a fully reversible fashion under ambient conditions. In contrast to previously reported multiferrocene assemblies, only the present capsule efficiently encapsulates typical organic/inorganic dyes as well as electron&#8208;accepting molecules in water. As a result, unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, displaying relatively wide absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;=650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm), are observed upon the encapsulation of acceptors (i.e., chloranil and TCNQ). The resultant encapsulation&#8208;induced CT interactions can be released by a redox stimulus through the disassembly of the capsule.

The resultant encapsulation-induced CT interactions can be released by a redox stimulus through the disassembly of the capsule.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long persistent luminescence (LPL) of 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites based on the self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. Through doping engineering, the LPL decay time is increased, the emission color is adjustable, and the thermal stability of PL enhances dramatically. Furthermore, we highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;halide perovskites have been enriched over recent years to offer remarkable features from diverse chemical structures and environmental stability endowed with exciting functionalities in photoelectric detectors and phosphorescence systems. However, the low conversion efficiency of singlet to triplet in 2D hybrid halide perovskites reduces phosphorescence lifetimes. In this study, the long persistent luminescence of 2D all&#8208;inorganic perovskites with a self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. The results show that the decay time of the long persistent luminescence increases from 450&#8197;s to 600&#8197;s, and the luminescence color changes from cyan to orange, and the thermal stability of photoluminescence enhances dramatically after replacing Cd2+ by appropriate Mn2+ ions in 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites. Furthermore, diversified anti&#8208;counterfeiting modes are fabricated to highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems with tunable persistent luminescence in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Therefore, our studies provide a novel model for realizing tunable long persistent luminescence of perovskite with 2D self&#8208;assembled layered structure for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry makes the next move in advancing organometallic synthesis. In their Research Article (e202305775), Riina Aav, Dzmitry G. Kananovich et&#8197;al. report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes the limitations of the classic solvent&#8208;based approach. Mechanochemical activation enables the rapid generation of Grignard reagents&#160;in situ, making the process resistant to air and allowing solid Br&#248;nsted acids to be used as additives to improve yields.

         <title>An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Tackling Conformational Energy Uncertainties in Chiroptical Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assignment of the absolute configuration of chiral compounds critically depends on the comparison with predictions of chiroptical spectra with intrinsically inaccurate quantum chemical calculations. Wybren&#8197;Jan Buma, Valentin&#8197;Paul Nicu et&#8197;al. report in their Research Article (e202307053) a novel protocol based on genetic algorithm analyses and hierarchical clustering that overcomes these inaccuracies as demonstrated by the elucidation of the absolute configuration and conformational landscape of natural products derived from the Haliclona sp. marine sponge.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Water and Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2O2 is a significant chemical widely utilized in the environmental and industrial fields, with growing global demand. Without sacrificial agents, simultaneously photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels from seawater is green and sustainable but still challenging. Herein, two novel thiophene&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (TD&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF) were first constructed and served as catalysts for H2O2 synthesis via indirect 2e&#8208; ORR and direct 2e&#8208; WOR channels. The photocatalytic H2O2 production performance can be regulated by adjusting the N&#8208;heterocycle modules (pyridine and triazine) in COFs. Notably, with no sacrificial agents, just using air and water as raw materials, TD&#8208;COF exhibited high H2O2 production yields of 4060 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, and 3364 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 in deionized water and natural seawater, respectively. Further computational mechanism studies revealed that the thiophene was the primary photoreduction unit for ORR, while the benzene ring (linked to the thiophene by the imine bond) was the central photooxidation unit for WOR. The current work exploits thiophene&#8208;containing COFs for overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via ORR and WOR dual channels and provides fresh insight into creating innovative catalysts for photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Microbial Corrosion by Magnetite and Electrically Conductive Pili through Direct Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;Microbe Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrobiocorrosion, the process in which microbes extract electrons from metallic iron (Fe0) through direct Fe0&#8208;microbe electrical connections, is thought to contribute to the costly corrosion of iron&#8208;containing metals that impacts many industries. However, electrobiocorrosion mechanisms are poorly understood. We report here that electrically conductive pili (e&#8208;pili) and the conductive mineral magnetite play an important role in the electron transfer between Fe0 and Geobacter sulfurreducens, the first microbe in which electrobiocorrosion has been rigorously documented. Genetic modification to express poorly conductive pili substantially diminished corrosive pitting and rates of Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;microbe electron flux. Magnetite reduced resistance to electron transfer, increasing corrosion currents and intensifying pitting. Studies with mutants suggested that the magnetite promoted electron transfer in a manner similar to the outer&#8208;surface c&#8208;type cytochrome OmcS. These findings, and the fact that magnetite is a common product of iron corrosion, suggest a potential positive feedback loop of magnetite produced during corrosion further accelerating electrobiocorrosion. The interactions of e&#8208;pili, cytochromes, and magnetite demonstrate mechanistic complexities of electrobiocorrosion, but also provide insights into detecting and possibly mitigating this economically damaging process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Borylcyclopropanation of Alkenes with a (Diborylmethyl)iodide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane skeletons play a prominent role in the development of organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a stable, multifunctional (diborylmethyl)iodide reagent (CHI(Bpin)2) for the photoinduced cyclopropanation of alkenes, providing an array of 1,2&#8208;substituted cyclopropylboronates in good yields. This &#945;&#8208;haloboronic ester can be readily synthesized on a multigram scale from commercially available starting materials. Furthermore, this protocol displays high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, excellent functional group tolerance, and allows for late&#8208;stage borylcyclopropanation of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the borylcyclopropanation proceeds via a radical addition/polar cyclization pathway mediated by the photocatalyst fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 and visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Lewis Acid&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium&#8208;Aryloxide Catalysis: Pyrazolone Addition to Nitroolefins as Entry to Diaminoamides</title>

         <dc:description>
Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. A polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst which enables their addition to nitroolefins with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol is presented. DFT studies show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The products were used to form bioactive compounds, pyrazolidinones and &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides.







Abstract
Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Their asymmetric synthesis is thus widely studied. Still, a generally highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to nitroolefins providing products with adjacent stereocenters is elusive. In this article, a new polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst is presented which enables this reaction type with high stereocontrol. DFT studies revealed that the triazolium stabilizes the transition state by hydrogen bonding between C(5)&#8722;H and the nitroolefin and verify a cooperative mode of activation. Moreover, they show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage/pore structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, by which stereocontrol is achieved. Control catalyst systems confirm the crucial role of the triazolium, aryloxide and CuII, requiring a sophisticated structural orchestration for high efficiency. The addition products were used to form pyrazolidinones by chemoselective C=N reduction. These heterocycles are shown to be valuable precursors toward &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides by chemoselective nitro and N&#8722;N bond reductions. Morphological profiling using the Cell painting assay identified biological activities for the pyrazolidinones and suggest modulation of DNA synthesis as a potential mode of action. One product showed biological similarity to Camptothecin, a lead structure for cancer therapy.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxidation of Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites as the most promising absorber materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved the record efficiency of over 14%. Although suppressing the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is a frequently concerned topic for Sn&#8208;based PSCs, many studies have given vague explanations and the mechanisms are still under debate. This is in principal due to the lack of the in&#8208;depth understanding of various and complex intrinsic and extrinsic factors causing the oxidation process. In this context, we critically review the chemical mechanism of facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and differentiate its detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level. More importantly, we classify and introduce the intrinsic factors (raw materials and solvent of perovskite precursors) and extrinsic factors (exposure to neutral oxygen and superoxide) causing the oxidation with their corresponding anti&#8208;oxidation improvement methods. The presented comprehensive understanding and prospect of the oxidation provide insightful guidance for suppressing the oxidation in Sn&#8208;based PSCs &#8220;from the beginning to the end&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Semiconducting Polymers Based on Simple Electron&#8208;Deficient Cyanated trans&#8208;1, 3&#8208;Butadienes for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance but low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers remains a significant challenge in the commercialization of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). To achieve this objective, it is essential to design the key electron&#8208;deficient units with simple molecular structure and facile preparation process, which can directly facilitate the production of low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers. Herein, by sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene &#960;&#8208;skeleton, we developed a series of structurally simple but highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNDE), 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNFDE), and 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNDFDE), featuring highly coplanar backbone and deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (&#8208;3.03&#8208;4.33 eV), which render them highly attractive building blocks for developing n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. Notably, all these electron&#8208;deficient units can be easily accessed via a two&#8208;step high&#8208;yield synthetic protocol from low&#8208;cost raw materials, thus rendering them highly promising candidates for commercial applications. Upon polymerized with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units, three copolymers are developed and demonstrated unipolar n&#8208;type transport characteristics in OFETs with the highest electron mobility &gt; 1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. Hence, CNDE, CNFDE, and CNDFDE represent a class of novel, simple, and efficient electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers, providing valuable insights for the OFET applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(Ethylene Piperidinium)s for Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) that possess both high hydroxide conductivity and stable mechanical and chemical properties poses a major challenge to the development of high&#8208;performance fuel cells. Improving one side of the balance between conductivity and stability usually means sacrificing the other. Herein, we used facile, high&#8208;yield chemical reactions to design and synthesize a piperidinium polymer with a polyethylene backbone for AEM fuel cell applications. To improve the performance, we introduced ionic crosslinking into high&#8208;cationic&#8208;ratio AEMs to suppress high water uptake and swelling while further improving the hydroxide conductivity. Remarkably, PEP80&#8208;20PS achieved a hydroxide conductivity of 354.3 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C while remaining mechanically stable. Compared with the base polymer PEP80, the water uptake of PEP80&#8208;20PS decreased by 69% from 813% to 350%, and the swelling decreased substantially by 85% from 350.0% to 50.2% at 80 &#176;C. PEP80&#8208;20PS also showed excellent alkaline stability, 84.7% remained after 35 days of treatment with an aqueous KOH solution. The chemical design in this study represents a significant advancement toward the development of simultaneously highly stable and conductive AEMs for fuel cell applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Generation Through Singlet Fission in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: An Alternative Route to Inefficient Singlet&#8208;Triplet Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High quantum yield triplets, populated by initially prepared excited singlets, are desired for various energy conversion schemes in solid working compositions like porous MOFs. However, a large disparity in the distribution of the excitonic center of mass, singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) in such assemblies is inhibited, so much so that a carboxy&#8208;coordinated zirconium heavy metal ion cannot effectively facilitate the ISC through spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Circumventing this sluggish ISC, singlet fission (SF) is explored as a viable route to generating triplets in solution&#8208;stable MOFs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High quantum yield triplets, populated by initially prepared excited singlets, are desired for various energy conversion schemes in solid working compositions like porous MOFs. However, a large disparity in the distribution of the excitonic center of mass, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) in such assemblies is inhibited, so much so that a carboxy-coordinated zirconium heavy metal ion cannot effectively facilitate the ISC through spin-orbit coupling. Circumventing this sluggish ISC, singlet fission (SF) is explored as a viable route to generating triplets in solution-stable MOFs. Efficient SF is achieved through a high degree of interchromophoric coupling that facilitates electron super-exchange to generate triplet pairs. Here we show that a predesigned chromophoric linker with extremely poor ISC efficiency (kISC) but  &#160;form triplets in MOF in contrast to the frameworks that are built from linkers with sizable kISC but . This work opens a new photophysical and photochemical avenue in MOF chemistry and utility in energy conversion schemes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides by Using Ball Milling and a Piezoelectric Material as the Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8208;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine &#160;and a terminal reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Reactivity of Borocarbonitride in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borocarbonitride (BCN) materials are newly developed oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes. However, BCN materials tend to form bulky B2O3 due to over&#8208;oxidation at the high reaction temperature, resulting in significant deactivation. Here, we report a series of super stable BCN nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance of the BCN nanosheets can be easily regulated by changing the guanine dosage. The control experiment and structural characterization indicate that the introduction of a suitable amount of carbon could prevent the formation of excessive B2O3 from BCN materials and maintain the 2D skeleton at a high temperature of 520 oC. The best&#8208;performing catalyst BCN exhibits 81.9% selectivity towards olefins with a stable propane conversion of 35.8%, and the propene productivity reaches 16.2 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, much better than commercial BN catalysts. Density functional theory calculation results show&#160;that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can significantly affect the electronic microenvironment of hexagonal BN (h&#8208;BN), thereby boosting the catalytic activity of BCN.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Interactions on Platinum/(Metal&#8208;Oxide)&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Boost Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By supporting platinum (Pt) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles on indium oxide (In2O3), we fabricate a CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst. Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) is achieved on CdS/Pt/In2O3 having electronic Pt&#8208;In2O3 interactions, with CH4 selectivity reaching to 100%, which is higher than that on CdS/Pt/In2O3 without electronic Pt&#8208;In2O3 interactions (71.7%). Moreover, enhancement effect of electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions on selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 also occurs by using other common metal oxides as photocatalyst supports, including titanium oxide, gallium oxide, zinc oxide and tungsten oxide. The electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions separate photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and convert CO2 into CO2&#948;&#8208; which can be easily hydrogenated into CH4 via a CO2&#948;&#8208; &#8594; HCOO* &#8594; HCO* &#8594; CH* &#8594; CH4 path, thus boosting selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. This offers a new way to achieve selective photoreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Modulation Enhances Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Deep Cycling of Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable Zn anodes with a high utilization efficiency pose a challenge due to notorious dendrite growth and severe side reactions. Therefore, electrolyte additives are developed to address these issues. However, the additives are always consumed by the electrochemical reactions over cycling, affecting the cycling stability. Here, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is reported as an electrolyte additive for achieving stable cycling of Zn anodes. HMPA reshapes the solvation structures and promotes anion decomposition, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. More interestingly, this anion decomposition does not involve HMPA, preserving its long&#8208;term impact on the electrolyte. Thus, the symmetric cells with HMPA in the electrolyte survive ~500 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8208;2 or ~200 h at 40 mA cm&#8208;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8208;2 with a Zn utilization rate of 85.6%. The full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio = 12 &#956;L mAh&#8208;1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio = 1.8) and a high areal capacity (6.6 mAh cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diboriranides are the smallest conceivable monoanionic aromatic cycles, yet only limited examples have been reported and their reactivity and complexation behavior remain completely unexplored. We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; as its lithium salt via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane from a readily available 1,2&#8208;dichlorodiborane(4) (Dur = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl). With the preparation and complete characterization of representative complexes with tin, copper, gold and zinc, we demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring&#8217;s 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Controlled CdS/Ti3C2 MXene Schottky Junction for Highly Selective and Active Photocatalytic Dehydrogenation&#8208;Reductive Amination&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic valorization and selective transformation of biomass&#8208;derived platform compounds offer great opportunities for efficient utilization of renewable resources under mild conditions. Here, the novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction (MCdS) composed of surface&#8208;controlled CdS and pretreated Ti3C2 MXene is created for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived amino acid production under ambient temperature with unprecedented activity and selectivity. Schottky junction efficiently promotes photoexcited charge migration and separation and inhibits photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination, which results in a super&#8208;high activity. Meanwhile, CdS with the reduced surface energy supplies sufficient hydrogen sources for imine reduction and induces the preferential orientation of alanine, thus contributing superior selectivity. Moreover, a wide range of hydroxyl acids are successfully converted into corresponding amino acids and even one&#8208;pot conversion of glucose to alanine is easily achieved over MCdS. This work illustrates the mechanism of crystal orientation control and heterojunction construction in controlling catalytic behavior of photocatalytic nanoreactor, providing a paradigm for construction of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8216;material of choice&#8217; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three&#8208;dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208;oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electrolysis to Formic Acid over a Wide Potential Window: An Electrocatalyst Comprised of Indium Nanoparticles on Chitosan&#8208;Derived Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium nanoparticles on chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) create bifunctional active centers that integrate chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for CO2 electrolysis. The electrocatalyst demonstrated outstanding performance for the CO2 reduction reaction with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward HCOOH across a wide potential window and with high current density.







Abstract
Realizing industrial&#8208;scale production of HCOOH from the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is very important, but the current density as well as the electrochemical potential window are still limited to date. Herein, we achieved this by integration of chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for the CO2RR via anchoring In nanoparticles (NPs) on biomass&#8208;derived substrates to create In/X&#8722;C (X=N, P, B) bifunctional active centers. The In NPs/chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) catalyst had outstanding performance for the CO2RR with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH across a wide potential window. Particularly, at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, the FE of HCOOH was as high as 96.0&#8201;%, and the reduction potential was as low as &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs RHE. When using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), a pure HCOOH solution could be obtained at the cathode without further separation and purification. The FE of HCOOH was still up to 93.3&#8201;% at 0.52&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the HCOOH production rate could reach 9.051&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our results suggested that the defects and multilayer structure in In/N&#8208;dG could not only enhance CO2 chemical adsorption capability, but also trigger the formation of an electron&#8208;rich catalytic environment around In sites to promote the generation of HCOOH.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;cis Disubstituted Cycloalkanes by Convergent NiH Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiH&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) of easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixture of cycloalkenes and a NiH&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization transformation of prochiral cyclic alkenes are reported. This migratory hydroalkylation process produces enantioenriched thermodynamically disfavored 1,2&#8208;cis cycloalkanes with excellent levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enantioenriched multi&#8208;substituted cycloalkanes constitute an essential class of compounds in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Here we report an NiH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric migratory hydroalkylation process for the efficient and selective construction of such compounds. Through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT), easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixtures of cycloalkenes could be directly utilized as starting materials, convergently producing thermo&#8208;dynamically disfavored chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes bearing vicinal stereocenters with high levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In addition, prochiral cyclic alkenes can be also employed, and deliver chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes through desymmetrization process.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed&#8208;loop recycling of vinylogous urethane vitrimers made from acetoacetate&#8208;terminated polyethyleneglycol and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine is presented. Treatment with water allows the selective and quantitative recovery of the monomers, even from mixed waste streams. The modular synthetic approach allows the synthesis of materials that cover a broad range of mechanical properties and that are easy to reprocess.







Abstract
Devising energy&#8208;efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis&#8208;polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (&#8776;98&#8201;%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG&#8208;based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed&#8208;loop recycling characteristics.

Novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step approach for the synthesis of polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) by incorporating nanogels into microgels via droplet&#8208;based microfluidics yielding different internal morphologies including phase&#8208;separated coacervates, statistically distributed coacervates and core&#8211;shell like arrangements by variation of synthesis parameters such as nanogel concentration, ionic strength and pH value.







Abstract
In pH&#8208;responsive drug carriers, the distribution of charges has been proven to affect delivery efficiency but is difficult to control and verify. Herein, we fabricate polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) and show that the arrangement of the nanogels (NG) can easily be manipulated by adapting synthesis conditions. Positively and negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive NG are synthesized by precipitation polymerization and labelled with different fluorescent dyes. The obtained NG are integrated into microgel (MG) networks by subsequent inverse emulsion polymerization in droplet&#8208;based microfluidics. By confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we verify that depending on NG concentration, pH value and ionic strength, NiM&#8722;C with different NG arrangements are obtained, including Janus&#8208;like phase&#8208;separation of NG, statistical distribution of NG, and core&#8211;shell arrangements. Our approach is a major step towards uptake and release of oppositely charged (drug) molecules.

         <title>In situ Generated Iridium Nanoparticles as Hydride Donors in Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions with Deuterium and Tritium Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the synergistic approach of in situ generated iridium nanoparticles in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization hydrogen isotope exchange with deuterium and tritium gas.







Abstract
We have studied the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reaction with deuterium or tritium gas as isotope sources and in situ formed transition metal nanoparticles as hydrogen atom transfer pre&#8208;catalysts. By this means we have found synergistic reactivities applying two different HIE mechanisms, namely photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization HIE leading to the synthesis of highly deuterated complex molecules. Finally, we adopted these findings successfully to tritium chemistry.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a Bond&#8208;Localized C2h Structure and a Challenge for Computational Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a computational challenge. Highly correlated methods and popular DFT functionals predict a bond&#8208;delocalized D2h symmetry, but excellent agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts suggests a true C2h geometry.







Abstract
Whether tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a symmetric D2h structure or a bond&#8208;alternating C2h structure remains a standing puzzle. Close agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts based on minima structures optimized at the M06&#8208;2X, &#969;B97X&#8208;D, and M11 levels confirm a bond&#8208;localized C2h symmetry, which is consistent with the expected strong antiaromaticity of TtB&#8208;s&#8208;indacene.

         <title>Polymerization Induced Microphase Separation for the Fabrication of Nanostructured Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) uses the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers during bulk polymerization to create nanostructured materials with highly tunable domain sizes and morphologies, including highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PIMS chemistry, and explores the wide variety of materials and applications accessible by the PIMS technique.







Abstract
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed with at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nanostructured materials with the highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11&#8197;years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence&#8208;based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.

         <title>Protein&#8208;based Nanoparticles: From Drug Delivery to Imaging, Nanocatalysis and Protein Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, significant progress was made in the development of protein nanoparticles, transitioning from artificial assemblies for drug delivery, to multifunctional systems for nanocatalysis and protein therapy. Advanced biohybrid materials, combined with dynamic chemistries and mild methods of particle formation produce nanoparticles that take advantage of the catalytic activity or targeting capabilities of the underlying proteins and enzymes.







Abstract
Proteins and enzymes are versatile biomaterials for a wide range of medical applications due to their high specificity for receptors and substrates, high degradability, low toxicity, and overall good biocompatibility. Protein nanoparticles are formed by the arrangement of several native or modified proteins into nanometer&#8208;sized assemblies. In this review, we will focus on artificial nanoparticle systems, where proteins are the main structural element and not just an encapsulated payload. While under natural conditions, only certain proteins form defined aggregates and nanoparticles, chemical modifications or a change in the physical environment can further extend the pool of available building blocks. This allows the assembly of many globular proteins and even enzymes. These advances in preparation methods led to the emergence of new generations of nanosystems that extend beyond transport vehicles to diverse applications, from multifunctional drug delivery to imaging, nanocatalysis and protein therapy.

         <title>Acidic Media Impedes Tandem Catalysis Reaction Pathways in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis effects in electrochemical CO2 reduction were investigated through an isotopic labelling strategy involving the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures. The results provide evidence that tandem catalysis does indeed occur in neutral electrolyte but is curtailed under acidic conditions. This is due to Cu becoming less effective at utilizing tandem&#8208;supplied CO in the presence of hydronium ions.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) in acidic media with Cu&#8208;based catalysts tends to suffer from lowered selectivity towards multicarbon products. This could in principle be mitigated using tandem catalysis, whereby the *CO coverage on Cu is increased by introducing a CO generating catalyst (e.g. Ag) in close proximity. Although this has seen significant success in neutral/alkaline media, here we report that such a strategy becomes impeded in acidic electrolyte. This was investigated through the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures using a series of Cu and CuAg catalysts. These experiments provide strong evidence for the occurrence of tandem catalysis in neutral media and its curtailment under acidic conditions. Density functional theory simulations suggest that the presence of H3O+ weakens the *CO binding energy of Cu, preventing effective utilization of tandem&#8208;supplied CO. Our findings also provide other unanticipated insights into the tandem catalysis reaction pathway and important design considerations for effective CO2R in acidic media.

         <title>MET&#8208;Activating Ubiquitin Multimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric small protein ligands, referred to as U&#8208;body constructs, were developed from ubiquitin and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via genetic implantation (lasso&#8208;grafting) and spacer optimization, showing antagonist or &#8220;enhancer&#8221; activity for a receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Subsequently, multimeric U&#8208;body&#8208;based proteins, U&#8208;bodies, were constructed, exhibiting potent agonist activity for MET.







Abstract
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U&#8208;bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET and are derived from MET&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U&#8208;body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso&#8208;grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U&#8208;body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U&#8208;body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF&#8208;induced MET&#8208;phosphorylation. Their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U&#8208;bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation&#8208;promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso&#8208;grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein&#8208;based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.

     alt="MET-Activating Ubiquitin Multimers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monomeric small protein ligands, referred to as U-body constructs, were developed from ubiquitin and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via genetic implantation (lasso-grafting) and spacer optimization, showing antagonist or &#8220;enhancer&#8221; activity for a receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Subsequently, multimeric U-body-based proteins, U-bodies, were constructed, exhibiting potent agonist activity for MET.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)-based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U-bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET and are derived from MET-binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U-body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso-grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U-body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U-body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF-induced MET-phosphorylation. Their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U-bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation-promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso-grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein-based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Type&#8208;II Red Phosphorus: Wavy Packing of Twisted Pentagonal Tubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of type&#8208;II red phosphorus is investigated by various structural characterizations, including 3D electron diffraction, atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. A triclinic unit cell with a large volume containing around 250 phosphorus atoms is identified via 3D electron diffraction. The twisted wavy tubular motif, a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, is also revealed via STEM.







Abstract
Elemental phosphorus exhibits fascinating structural varieties and versatile properties. The unique nature of phosphorus bonds can lead to the formation of extremely complex structures, and detailed structural information on some phosphorus polymorphs is yet to be investigated. In this study, we investigated an unidentified crystalline phase of phosphorus, type&#8208;II red phosphorus (RP), by combining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural characterization techniques. Electron diffraction tomography, atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were concurrently used to elucidate the hidden structural motifs and their packing in type&#8208;II RP. Electron diffraction tomography, performed using individual crystalline nanowires, was used to identify a triclinic unit cell with volume of 5330&#8197;&#197;3, which is the largest unit cell for elemental phosphorus crystals up to now and contains approximately 250 phosphorus atoms. Atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, which was performed along different crystal&#8208;zone axes, confirmed that the twisted wavy tubular motif is the basic building block of type&#8208;II RP. Our study discovered and presented a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, and it provides insights to clarify the complexities observed in phosphorus as well as other relevant systems.

         <title>Autohydrolysis of Diglycine&#8208;Activated Succinic Esters Boosts Cellular Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxy&#8208;terminal diglycine&#8208;modified succinate compounds undergo autohydrolysis at physiological pH. This process converts supramolecular assemblies from nanofibers to nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. This approach also restores drug efficacy, promoting effective intracellular therapeutics.







Abstract
Rapid cellular uptake of synthetic molecules remains a challenge, and the motif frequently employed to generate prodrugs, succinic ester, unfortunately lowers the efficacy of the desired drugs due to their slow ester hydrolysis and low cell entry. Here we show that succinic ester&#8208;containing diglycine drastically boosts the cellular uptake of supramolecular assemblies or prodrugs. Specifically, autohydrolysis of the diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters turns the nanofibers of the conjugates of succinic ester and self&#8208;assembling motif into nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. The autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters and drug conjugates also restores the efficacy of the drugs. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests that a &#8220;U&#8208;turn&#8221; of diglycine favors intramolecular hydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters to promote autohydrolysis. As an example of rapid autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters for instant cellular uptake, this work illustrates a nonenzymatic bond cleavage approach to develop effective therapeutics for intracellular targeting.

         <title>Fluorogenic and Cell&#8208;Permeable Rhodamine Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Live&#8208;Cell Protein Labeling in Bioimaging and Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the equilibrium between a nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion state (protein&#8208;bound), fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamine dyes have been developed for high&#8208;contrast protein labeling in living cells. Such new generation of probes offer exceptional performance in multi&#8208;color/lifetime imaging, superresolution microscopy, single protein tracking, and chemigenetic biosensors.







Abstract
The advancement of fluorescence microscopy techniques has opened up new opportunities for visualizing proteins and unraveling their functions in living biological systems. Small&#8208;molecule organic dyes, which possess exceptional photophysical properties, small size, and high photostability, serve as powerful fluorescent reporters in protein imaging. However, achieving high&#8208;contrast live&#8208;cell labeling of target proteins with conventional organic dyes remains a considerable challenge in bioimaging and biosensing due to their inadequate cell permeability and high background signal. Over the past decade, a novel generation of fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable dyes has been developed, which have substantially improved live&#8208;cell protein labeling by fine&#8208;tuning the reversible equilibrium between a cell&#8208;permeable, nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion (protein&#8208;bound) of rhodamines. In this review, we present the mechanism and design strategies of these fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamines, as well as their applications in bioimaging and biosensing.

Polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF)&#8208;based battery separator as an ideal lightweight barrier (ca. 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was first directly involved in the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (Li&#8722;S) system to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect through supramolecularly recognizing polysulfide guests and then catalyzing their conversion while simultaneously accelerating Li+ ions diffusion in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Developing polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF) still remains challenging due to an extremely difficult task in rationally interconnecting two dissimilar building blocks. Here we report an unprecedented POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF crystalline structure produced through the self&#8208;assembly process of a Krebs&#8208;type POM, [Zn2(WO2)2(SbW9O33)2]10&#8722;, and two &#946;&#8208;CD units. The as&#8208;prepared POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF&#8208;based battery separator can be applied as a lightweight barrier (approximately 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The designed Li&#8722;S batteries equipped with the POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF modified separator exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, attributed to fast Li+ diffusion through the supramolecular channel of &#946;&#8208;CD, efficient polysulfide&#8208;capture ability by the dynamic host&#8211;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD, and improved sulfur redox kinetics by the bidirectional catalysis of POM cluster. This research provides a broad perspective for the development of multifunctional supramolecular POM frameworks and their applications in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Managing Excess Lead Iodide with Functionalized Oxo&#8208;graphene Nanosheets for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stability issues could refrain from commercializing lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) despite having comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long&#8208;term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets (Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7% in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) PSCs. Devices retain 93.8% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stability issues could refrain from commercializing lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) despite having comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long-term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo-graphene nanosheets (Dec-oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec-oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec-oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7% in inverted (p-i-n) PSCs. Devices retain 93.8% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one-sun illumination, and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fragment Screening and Fast Micromolar Detection on a Benchtop NMR Spectrometer Boosted by Photoinduced Hyperpolarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fragment&#8208;based drug design is a well&#8208;established strategy for rational drug design, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on high&#8208;field spectrometers as the method of reference for screening and hit validation. However, high&#8208;field NMR spectrometers are not only expensive, but require specialized maintenance, dedicated space, and depend on liquid helium cooling which became critical over the recurring global helium shortages. We propose an alternative to high&#8208;field NMR screening by applying the recently developed approach of fragment screening by photoinduced hyperpolarized NMR on a cryogen&#8208;free 80 MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer yielding signal enhancements of up to three orders in magnitude. It is demonstrated that it is possible to discover new hits and kick&#8208;off drug design using a benchtop NMR spectrometer at low micromolar concentrations of both protein and ligand. The approach presented performs at higher speed than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;field NMR approaches while exhibiting a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Photoinduced hyperpolarization is known to be inexpensive and simple to be implemented, which aligns greatly with the philosophy of benchtop NMR spectrometers. These findings open the way for the use of benchtop NMR in near&#8208;physiological conditions for drug design and further life science applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polymethacrylates made by ATRP and RAFT Polymerization: High&#8208;Yielding Depolymerization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although controlled radical polymerization is an excellent tool to make precision polymeric materials, reversal of the process to retrieve the starting monomer is far less explored despite the significance of chemical recycling. Here, we investigate the bulk depolymerization of RAFT and ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers under identical conditions. RAFT&#8208;synthesized polymers undergo a relatively low&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free depolymerization back to monomer thanks to the partial in&#8208;situ transformation of the RAFT end&#8208;group to macromonomer. Instead, ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers can only depolymerize at significantly higher temperatures (&gt;350 &#730;C) through random backbone scission. To aid a more complete depolymerization at even lower temperatures, we performed a facile and quantitative end&#8208;group modification strategy in which both ATRP and RAFT end&#8208;groups were successfully converted to macromonomers. The macromonomers triggered a lower temperature bulk depolymerization with an onset at 150 &#730;C yielding up to 90% of monomer regeneration. The versatility of the methodology was demonstrated by a scalable depolymerization (~10 g of starting polymer) retrieving 84% of the starting monomer intact which could be subsequently used for further polymerization. This work presents a new low&#8208;energy approach for depolymerizing controlled radical polymers and creates many future opportunities as high&#8208;yielding, solvent&#8208;free and scalable depolymerization methods are sought.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real&#8208;time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative in situ technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non&#8208;invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light&#8208;driven catalysts enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Hydrolytically Degradable Block Copolymer Nanoparticles via Reverse Sequence Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrolytically degradable block copolymer nanoparticles are prepared via reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in aqueous media. This efficient one&#8208;pot protocol involves the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMAC) using a monofunctional or bifunctional trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) precursor. DMAC monomer is employed as a co&#8208;solvent to solubilize the hydrophobic PCL chains. At an intermediate DMAC conversion of 20&#8208;60%, the homogeneous reaction mixture is diluted with water to 10&#8208;25% w/w solids. The growing amphiphilic block copolymer chains undergo nucleation to form sterically&#8208;stabilized PCL&#8208;core nanoparticles with PDMAC coronas. 1H NMR studies confirm &gt;99% DMAC conversion while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) studies indicate well&#8208;controlled RAFT polymerizations (Mw/Mn &#8804; 1.30). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicate spheres of 20&#8208;120 nm diameter. As expected, hydrolytic degradation occurs within days at 37 &#186;C in either acidic or alkaline solution. Degradation is also observed in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 37 &#186;C. However, no degradation can be detected over a three&#8208;month period when these nanoparticles are stored at 20 &#186;C in deionized water (pH 6.7).

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Bromination, Chlorination and Thiocyanation Using Inorganic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative halogenations of alkyl carboxylic acids are highly valuable reactions for the synthesis of stucturally diverse alkyl halides. However, many reported protocols rely on stoichiometric strong oxidants or highly electrophilic halogenating agents. Herein, we describe visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative halogenations of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide&#8208;activated carboxylic acids that avoid stiochiometric oxidants and use inexpensive inorganic halide salts as the halogenating agents. Brominations with lithium bromide proceed under simple, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using an organic photoredox catalyst and no other additives, whereas dual photoredox&#8211;copper&#8208;catalysis is required for chlorinations with lithium chloride. The mild conditions display excellent functional group tolerance, which is demonstrated through the transformation of a diverse range of structurally complex carboxylic acid&#8208;containing natural products into the corresponding alkyl bromides and chlorides. In addition, we show the generality of the dual photoredox&#8211;copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalizations with inorganic salts by extension to a thiocyanation with potasium thiocyanide, which was applied to the synthesis of complex alkyl thiocyanates.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Access to a Bowl&#8208;Type Macrocycle and a Barrel&#8208;Type Heptanuclear Complex Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) is a powerful and widely applied tool in modern synthetic chemistry, which is based on the reversible cleavage and formation of covalent bonds. One of the inherent strengths of this approach is the perspective to reversibly generate novel structural motifs in an operationally simple approach, which are difficult or impossible to access with more traditional methods and require multiple bond cleaving and bond forming steps. To date, these fundamentally important synthetic and conceptual challenges in the context of DCvC have predominantly been tackled by exploiting compounds of lighter p&#8208;block elements, albeit heavier p&#8208;block elements show low bond dissociation energies and appear to be ideally suited for this approach. Here we show that a dinuclear organometallic bismuth compound, containing BiMe2 groups that are connected by a thioxanthene linker, readily undergoes selective and reversible cleavage of its Bi&#8211;C bonds upon exposure to external stimuli. The exploitation of DCvC in the field of organometallic heavy p&#8208;block chemistry grants access to unprecedented macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type oligonuclear compounds.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) is a powerful and widely applied tool in modern synthetic chemistry, which is based on the reversible cleavage and formation of covalent bonds. One of the inherent strengths of this approach is the perspective to reversibly generate novel structural motifs in an operationally simple approach, which are difficult or impossible to access with more traditional methods and require multiple bond cleaving and bond forming steps. To date, these fundamentally important synthetic and conceptual challenges in the context of DCvC have predominantly been tackled by exploiting compounds of lighter p-block elements, albeit heavier p-block elements show low bond dissociation energies and appear to be ideally suited for this approach. Here we show that a dinuclear organometallic bismuth compound, containing BiMe2 groups that are connected by a thioxanthene linker, readily undergoes selective and reversible cleavage of its Bi&#8211;C bonds upon exposure to external stimuli. The exploitation of DCvC in the field of organometallic heavy p-block chemistry grants access to unprecedented macrocyclic and barrel-type oligonuclear compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Metallic Superionic Layers Suppressing Voltage Fading of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Towards Superior&#8208;Stable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs) with greater specific capacity density are constrained by voltage attenuation and inferior rate performance because of irreversible oxygen release, metal dissolving and poor lithium&#8208;ion transport capacity. Herein, a simple surface modification is designed to solve the performance degradation and structural collapse of LRLOs. Combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO) with spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, is introduced to the surface of the cathode restrains the activated surficial lattice oxygen ions by its stable oxygen vacancies. Additionally, Ni doping results in a fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 structure (LNO) with lowered lithium ions diffusion barrier, which is tightly conjugating to substrate and synergistically reinforces the Li diffusion path through the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Moreover, Mn dissolution is successfully relieved due to the decrease in Mn concentration in the coating layers. As a result, the modified material (LRLO@LMO@LNO) exhibits an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 120.4 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 10 C with a very small discharge voltage attenuation of 313 mV after 600 cycles (0.52 mV per cycle) at 1 C. Undoubtedly, this method discloses a simple and effective approach to promote the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density.</dc:description>

         <title>Alignment and Dynamic Inversion of Planar Chirality in Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pillar[n]arenes are symmetrical macrocyclic compounds composed of benzene panels with para&#8208;methylene linkages. Each panel usually exhibits planar chirality and prefers chirality&#8208;aligned states. Because of this feature, pillar[n]arenes are attractive scaffolds for chiroptical materials that are easy to prepare and optically resolve and show intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. In addition, rotation of the panels endows the chirality of pillar[n]arenes with a dynamic nature. The chirality in tubular oligomers and supramolecular assemblies sometimes show time&#8208; and procedure&#8208;dependent alignment phenomena. Furthermore, the CD signals of some pillar[n]arenes respond to the addition of chiral guests when their dynamic chirality is coupled with host&#8211;guest properties. By using diastereomeric pillar[n]arenes with additional chiral structures, the response can also be caused by achiral guests and changes of the environment, providing molecular sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Generation of Cyanocarbenes from Alkynyl Triazenes for the Synthesis of Nitrile Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists and especially acid&#8208;induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern involving the cleavage of the N1&#8208;N2 bond of the triazene moiety resulting in a unique approach to cyanocarbenes from a readily available, stable, and insensitive precursor. This allows to access various nitrile compounds without the use of a toxic cyanating agent by exploiting the reactivity pattern of carbenes. By variation of the reaction conditions and light sources, different substitution patterns can be obtained selectively in good yields under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions, thus introducing the alkynyl triazene unit as a photo accessible methylene nitrile synthon. Using this synthon, subclasses like &#945;&#8208;alkoxynitriles, &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrazones become easily available. These exhibit synthetically valuable substitution patterns for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, intermediates for total synthesis and amino acid synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; in the energy storage field due to their high energy density (theoretically &gt;500 Wh kg&#8208;1). Recently, tremendous efforts have been made to promote the research &amp; development (R&amp;D) of pouch&#8208;type LMBs toward practical application. This article aims to provide a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth review of recent progress on pouch&#8208;type LMBs from full cell aspect, and to offer insights to guide its future development. It will review pouch&#8208;type LMBs using both liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and cover topics related to both Li and cathode (including LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2, S and O2) as both electrodes impact the battery performance. The key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs and their relationship in between are introduced first, then the major challenges facing the development of pouch&#8208;type LMBs are discussed in detail, especially those severely aggravated in pouch cells compared with coin cells. Subsequently, the recent progress on mechanistic understandings of the degradation of pouch&#8208;type LMBs is summarized, followed with the practical strategies that have been utilized to address these issues and to improve the key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs. In the end, it provides perspectives on advancing the R&amp;Ds of pouch&#8208;type LMBs towards their application in practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Titanium and Chromium Catalysis in a Reaction Network for the Reprogramming of [BH4]&#8208; as Electron Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reagent for Radical Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We describe a unique catalytic system with an efficient coupling of Ti&#8208; and Cr&#8208;catalyst in a reaction network that allows the use of [BH4]&#8208; as stoichiometric hydrogen atom and electron donor in catalytic radical chemistry. The key feature is a relay hydrogen atom transfer from [BH4]&#8208; to Cr generating the active catalysts under mild conditions. This enables epoxide reductions, regiodivergent epoxide opening and radical cyclizations that are not possible with cooperative catalysis with radicals or by epoxide reductions via Meinwald rearrangement and ensuing carbonyl reduction. No typical SN2&#8208;type reactivity of [BH4]&#8208; salts is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective activation of strong C&#8211;Cl bond for highly selective photosynthesis of bibenzyl via homo&#8208;coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;carbon&#160;coupling of organic halides as an important process in organic synthesis has been successfully achieved in homogeneous catalysis, while the dependence on rare noble metals, complicated metal&#8208;complex and poor catalyst stability and recyclability, need&#160;to be tackled. The past few years have witnessed heterogeneous photocatalysis as&#160;green and novel methods for organic synthesis processes. However, the study on C&#8211;C coupling of chloride substrates is very limited due to the extremely high bond energy of C&#8211;Cl bond (327 kJ mol&#8208;1). Here, we report a robust heterogeneous photocatalyst (Cu/ZnO) to drive the homo&#8208;coupling of benzyl chloride with high efficiency, which achieves an unprecedented high selectivity of bibenzyl (93%) and yield rate of 92% at room temperature. Moreover, this photocatalytic process can be applied to 10 benzyl chlorides with high yields. With detailed characterisation (XPS, EPR, TPD) and DFT calculation, the high selectivity is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of reactants, stabilisation of intermediates (benzyl radicals) for the selective coupling by the Cu loading and the moderate oxidation ability of ZnO support, besides the promoted charge separation and transfer by Cu species. Therefore, this work offers a new route to highly selective synthesise bibenzyl from chloride substrates by a stable heterogeneous system.</dc:description>

         <title>NH4+ Charge Carrier Coordinated H&#8208;Bonded Organic Small Molecule for Fast and Superstable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small molecules as high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Zn&#8722;organic batteries have inspired numerous interests, but are trapped by their easy&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes. Here we knit ultrastable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks between 2, 7&#8208;dinitropyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (DNPT) and NH4+ charge carrier. DNPT with octuple&#8208;active carbonyl/nitro centers (H&#8208;bond acceptor) are redox&#8208;exclusively accessible for flexible tetrahedral NH4+ ions (H&#8208;bond donator) but exclude larger and rigid Zn2+, due to a lower activation energy (0.14 vs. 0.31 eV). NH4+ coordinated H&#8208;bonding chemistry conquers the stability barrier of DNPT in electrolyte, and gives fast diffusion kinetics of non&#8208;metallic charge carrier. A stable two&#8208;step 4e&#8722; NH4+ coordination with DNPT cathode harvests a high capacity (320 mAh g&#8722;1), a high&#8208;rate capability (50 A g&#8722;1) and an ultralong life (60,000 cycles). This finding points to a new paradigm for H&#8208;bond stabilized organic small molecules to design advanced zinc batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry Reveals Kinetics Information of Metal&#8208;Ion Battery Materials with Multiple Redox Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB) has emerged as a promising cathode material in aqueous batteries. It possesses two distinct redox centers, and the potassium ions (K+) are unevenly distributed throughout the compound, adding complexity to the interpretation of the K+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion kinetic mechanism. Traditional ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements are limited in uncovering the precise kinetic information of the PB particles, as the results are influenced by the construction of the porous composite electrode and the redox behavior from different particles. In this study, the electrochemical processes of individual PB particles were investigated using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. By varying the potentials, different types of transient current signals were obtained that revealed the kinetic mechanism of each oxidation/reduction reaction in combination with theoretical simulation. Additionally, a partially contradictory conclusion between single&#8208;particle analysis and the ensemble&#8208;averaged measurement was discussed. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the electrochemical processes of cathode materials with multiple redox centers, which facilitates the development of effective strategies to optimize these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Cation Solvation Structure for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balancing the activation of H2O is crucial for highly selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), as the protonation steps of CO2RR require fast H2O dissociation kinetics, while suppressing hydrogen evolution (HER) demands slow H2O reduction. We herein proposed one molecular engineering strategy to regulate the H2O activation using aprotic organic small molecules with high Gutmann donor number as a solvation shell regulator. These organic molecules occupy the first solvation shell of K+ and accumulates in the electrical double layer, decreasing the H2O density at the interface and the relative content of proton suppliers (free and coordinated H2O), suppressing the HER. The adsorbed H2O was stabilized via second sphere effect and its dissociation was promoted by weakening the O&#8208;H bond, which accelerates the subsequent *CO2 protonation kinetics and reduces the energy barrier from 0.93 to 0.42 eV. In the model electrolyte containing 5 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive (KCl&#8208;DMSO&#8208;5), the highest CO selectivity over Ag foil increased to 99.2%, with FECO higher than 90.0% within &#8208;0.75 to &#8208;1.15 V (vs. RHE). This molecular engineering strategy for cation solvation shell can be extended to other metal electrodes, such as Zn and Sn, and organic molecule like N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Endocyclic 1&#8208;Azaallyl Anions: Concise Synthesis of Unprotected Enantioenriched cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diarylpiperidines</title>

         <dc:description>
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized from readily available piperidines in only three operations. The key step is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and endocyclic 1&#8208;azallyl anions, elusive intermediates derived from the in situ deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction can be achieved enantioselectively with a chiral mono&#8208;phosphine ligand.







Abstract
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized through an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions. These intermediates are generated in situ by the deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines, precursors that are readily prepared in two operations from simple piperidines. An asymmetric version of this reaction with (2R, 3R)&#8208;iPr&#8208;BI&#8208;DIME as the ligand provides products in moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Platinum Hybrids for Covalent Binding of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Structural Basis and Application to Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of G4&#8208;targeting organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, designed to covalently bind to the G4 binding site, could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway, induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and stimulate potent immunotherapy in vivo. This study highlights the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent binding in G4&#8208;targeting drug design.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been revived as promising therapeutic targets with the development of immunotherapy, but the G4&#8208;mediated immune response remains unclear. We designed a novel class of G4&#8208;binding organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, with spatial matching for G4 binding and G4 DNA reactivity for binding site locking. The solution structure of L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;MYT1L G4 demonstrated the effectiveness of the covalent binding and revealed the covalent binding&#8208;guided dynamic balance, accompanied by the destruction of the A5&#8208;T17 base pairs to achieve the covalent binding of the platinum unit to N7 of the G6 residue. Furthermore, L1&#8208;cispt&#8208; and L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;mediated genomic dysfunction could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). The use of L1&#8208;cispt/L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;treated dying cells as therapeutic vaccines stimulated a robust immune response and effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent locking in G4&#8208;trageting drug design and their potential in immunotherapy.

Achieving both high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) to boost power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) is a major challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs), wherein high energy loss (Eloss) and inefficient charge transfer usually take place. Here, three new Y&#8208;series acceptors of mono&#8208;asymmetric asy&#8208;YC11 and dual&#8208;asymmetric bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC9 and bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 are developed. They share the same asymmetric D1AD2 (D1=thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and D2=selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) fused&#8208;core but have different unidirectional sidechain on D1 side, allowing fine&#8208;tuned molecular properties, such as intermolecular interaction, packing pattern, and crystallinity. Among the binary blends, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 one has better morphology with appropriate phase separation and higher order packing than the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;asy&#8208;YC9 and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC11 ones. Therefore, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs offer a higher PCE of 17.16&#8201;% with both high Voc and Jsc, due to the reduced Eloss and efficient charge transfer properties. Inspired by the high Voc and strong NIR&#8208;absorption, bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 is introduced into efficient binary PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO to construct ternary OSCs. Thanks to the broadened absorption, optimized morphology, and furtherly minimized Eloss, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion PCE of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among these annealing&#8208;free devices. Our developed unidirectional sidechain engineering for constructing bi&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptors provides an approach to boost PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Deciphering Reversible Homogeneous Catalysis of the Electrochemical H2 Evolution and Oxidation: Role of Proton Relays and Local Concentration Effects
</title>

         <dc:description>
Analytical treatment allows determining all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen mediated by DuBois/Shaw nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant bases. This analysis shed light on the key activity descriptors responsible for reversible vs. bidirectional catalysis and paves the way towards rational optimization of such molecular catalysts







Abstract
Nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant amines form a unique series of catalysts (so&#8208;called DuBois&#8217; catalysts) capable of bidirectional/reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen. This unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed close to the metal center. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a mechanistic model and its kinetic treatment that may apply to all DuBois&#8217; catalysts and show that it allows for a good fit of experimental data measured at different pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from balanced equilibria related to hydrogen uptake/evolution on one side and (metal)&#8208;hydride installation/capture on the other side, both controlled by concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays and connected by two square schemes corresponding to proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. We show that the catalytic bias is controlled by the kinetic of the H2 uptake/evolution step. Reversibility does not require that the energy landscape be flat, with redox transitions occurring at potentials up to 250&#8197;mV away for the equilibrium potential, although such large deviations from a flat energy landscape can negatively impacts the rate of catalysis when coupled with slow interfacial electron transfer kinetics.

         <title>Atomically Precise Copper Nanoclusters for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 towards Hydrocarbons via Breaking the Coordination Symmetry of Cu Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the coordination symmetry of Cu site in atomically precise Cu6 cluster to form Cu&#8208;S2N1 site, which rank the dx2&#8208;y2 orbital as the highest occupied d orbital to favor the specific coordination between C atom of CO2 and Cu&#8722;S2N1 site. This binding mode is conductive to the generation of *COOH instead of *OCHO, thereby switching the product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons.







Abstract
We propose an effective highest occupied d&#8208;orbital modulation strategy engendered by breaking the coordination symmetry of sites in the atomically precise Cu nanocluster (NC) to switch the product of CO2 electroreduction from HCOOH/CO to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons. An atomically well&#8208;defined Cu6 NC with symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 active sites (named Cu6(MBD)6, MBD=2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole) was designed and synthesized by a judicious choice of ligand containing both S and N coordination atoms. Different from the previously reported high HCOOH selectivity of Cu NCs with Cu&#8722;S3 sites, the Cu6(MBD)6 with Cu&#8722;S2N1 coordination structure shows a high Faradaic efficiency toward hydrocarbons of 65.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (including 42.5&#8201;% CH4 and 23&#8201;% C2H4), with the hydrocarbons partial current density of &#8722;183.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 sites can rearrange the Cu 3d orbitals with 
 as the highest occupied d&#8208;orbital, thus favoring the generation of key intermediate *COOH instead of *OCHO to favor *CO formation, followed by hydrogenation and/or C&#8722;C coupling to produce hydrocarbons. This is the first attempt to regulate the coordination mode of Cu atom in Cu NCs for hydrocarbons generation, and provides new inspiration for designing atomically precise NCs for efficient CO2RR towards highly&#8208;valued products.

         <title>Catalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation with Polyhydride Ni/Ga Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic cluster [Ni3(GaTMP)7] reversibly forms di&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and hexahydride species under hydrogen pressure in solution, that were characterized by low temperature COSY and ROESY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. The work conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal main&#8208;group bimetallic clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.







Abstract
The bimetallic, decanuclear Ni3Ga7&#8208;cluster of the formula [Ni3(GaTMP)3(&#956;2&#8208;GaTMP)3(&#956;3&#8208;GaTMP)] (1, TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl) reacts reversibly with dihydrogen under the formation of a series of (poly&#8208;)hydride clusters 2. Low&#8208;temperature 2D NMR experiments at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C show that 2 consist of a mixture of a di&#8208; (2Di), tetra&#8208; (2Tetra) and hexahydride species (2Hexa). The structures of 2Di and 2Tetra are assessed by a combination of 2D NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The cooperation of both metals is essential for the high hydrogen uptake of the cluster. Polyhydrides 2 are catalytically active in the semihydrogenation of 4&#8208;octyne to 4&#8208;octene with good selectivity. The example is the first of its kind and conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal/main group metal clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial MVs induced silent secondary metabolite production in a wide range of bacteria by imitating interbacterial interactions. X.&#8197;innexi activated the production of xeinamides, xeidopeptides and xenoamicins through quorum sensing suppression by B.&#8197;multivorans MVs treatment. Xenoamicins carried in X.&#8197;innexi MVs suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, indicating interbacterial hostile interaction by MVs and secondary metabolites.







Abstract
Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B.&#8197;multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X.&#8197;innexi. In turn, the X.&#8197;innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B.&#8197;multivorans and X.&#8197;innexi through MV exchange.
