      <title>Fast and Stable N&#8208;Terminal Cysteine Modification via Thiazolidino Boronate Mediated Acyl Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a novel conjugation chemistry of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (NCys) that proceeds with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity, allowing facile modification of NCys&#8208;bearing proteins in complex biological milieu. This new NCys conjugation proceeds with  a thiazolidine boronate (TzB) intermediate  that results from fast (  k  2  : ~5000 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) and reversible conjugation of NCys with 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA). We have designed a FPBA derivative that upon TzB formation elicits an intramolecular acyl transfer to give N&#8208;acyl thiazolidines. In contrast to the quick hydrolysis of TzB, the N&#8208;acylated thiazolidines exhibit robust stability under physiologic conditions. The utility of the TzB mediated NCys conjugation is demonstrated by rapid and non&#8208;disruptive labeling of two enzymes. Furthermore, applying this chemistry to bacteriophage allows facile chemical modification of phage libraries, which greatly expands the chemical space amenable to phage display.</dc:description>

      <title>Shedding Light on the Diverse Reactivity of an Al(I) Compound with N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>The aluminum (I) compound NacNacAl (  1  ) shows diverse and substrate&#8208;controlled reactivity in reactions with  N  &#8208;heterocycles. DMAP, a basic substrate in which the 4&#8208;position is blocked, induces rearrangement of NacNacAl by shifting a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of the NacNac backbone to the aluminum center. In contrast, CH activation of the methyl group of 4&#8208;picoline takes place to produce a species with a reactive terminal methylene. Reaction of  1  with 3,5&#8208;lutidine results in the first example of an uncatalyzed, room temperature cleavage of an sp  2  C&#8208;H bond (in the 4&#8208;position) by Al(I). Another reactivity mode was observed for quinoline which undergoes 2,2&#8217;&#8208;coupling. Finally, reaction with phthalazine produces the product of N&#8208;N bond cleavage.</dc:description>

      <title>Selection of DNA&#8208;encoded Dynamic Chemical Libraries for Direct Inhibitor Discovery</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) is a powerful tool for ligand discovery in biomedical research; however, the development of DCL has been hampered by its low diversity. Recently, the concept of DNA encoding has been employed in DCL to create DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic libraries (DEDLs); however, all current DEDLs are limited to fragment identification, and a challenging process of fragment linking is required after selection. We report an anchor&#8208;directed DEDL approach that can identify full ligand structures from large&#8208;scale DEDLs. This method is also able to convert unbiased libraries to focused ones targeting specific protein classes. We demonstrated this method by selecting DEDLs against five proteins, and novel inhibitors have been identified for all targets. Notably, several selective BD1/BD2 inhibitors were identified from the selections against BRD4 (bromodomain 4), an important anti&#8208;cancer drug target. This work may provide a broadly applicable method for inhibitor discovery.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) is a powerful tool for ligand discovery in biomedical research; however, the development of DCL has been hampered by its low diversity. Recently, the concept of DNA encoding has been employed in DCL to create DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic libraries (DEDLs); however, all current DEDLs are limited to fragment identification, and a challenging process of fragment linking is required after selection. We report an anchor&#8208;directed DEDL approach that can identify full ligand structures from large&#8208;scale DEDLs. This method is also able to convert unbiased libraries to focused ones targeting specific protein classes. We demonstrated this method by selecting DEDLs against five proteins, and novel inhibitors have been identified for all targets. Notably, several selective BD1/BD2 inhibitors were identified from the selections against BRD4 (bromodomain 4), an important anti&#8208;cancer drug target. This work may provide a broadly applicable method for inhibitor discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Abstract:&#160; In this minireview, we describe synthetic polymers densely functionalized with sequence&#8208;defined biomolecular sidechains. We focus on synthetic brush polymers of oligonucleotides, oligosaccharides, and oligopeptides, prepared via graft&#8208;through polymerization from biomolecule functionalized monomers. The resulting structures are brush polymers wherein a biomolecular graft is positioned at each monomer backbone unit.

      <title>Bridge Bonded Oxygen Ligands between Approximated FeN4 Sites Confer the Catalysts with High ORR Performance</title>
      <dc:description>The applications of the most promising Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts are prohibited by their limited intrinsic activity. Manipulating the Fe energy level through anchoring electron withdrawing ligands is found effective in boosting the catalytic performance. However, such regulation remains  elusive  as the ligands are only uncontrollably introduced owning to their energetically instable nature. Here we report a rational manipulation strategy for introducing axial bonded O to the Fe sites, attained through hexa&#8208;coordinating Fe with oxygen functional groups in the precursor. Moreover, the O modifier is stabilized by forming the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bridge bond, with the approximation of two FeN  4  sites. The energy level modulation thus created confers the sites with an intrinsic activity over 10 times higher than the normal FeN  4  site. Our finding opens up a novel strategy to manage coordination environment at atomic scale towards high activity ORR catalysts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) AA&#8242;n&#8722;1MnX3n+1 type halide perovskites incorporating straight chain symmetric diammonium cations define a new type of structure that holds potential of both highly efficient charge transport and high environmental stability. Unfortunately, their optoelectronic properties are largely unexplored and there is lack of high quality single crystals in large dimension for practical application. Here, we ventured into synthesizing centimeter&#8208;sized AA&#8242;n&#8722;1MnX3n+1 type perovskite BDAPbI4 (BDA = NH3C4H8NH3) single crystal and reported its charge transport properties under X&#8208;ray excitation. The crystals were grown via a modified temperature crystallization method. It is found that the crystal shows a staggered configuration of the [PbI6]4&#8208; layers, a bandgap of 2.37 eV and a low trap density of 3.1 &#215; 109 cm&#8208;3. The single crystal X&#8208;ray detector exhibits an excellent sensitivity of 242 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 under the 10 V bias (0.31 V &#956;m&#8208;1), a detection limit as low as 430 nGyair s&#8208;1, ultra&#8208;stable response current, a stable baseline with the lowest dark current drift of 6.06 &#215;10&#8208;9 nA cm&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 V&#8208;1, and rapid response time of &#964;rise = 7.3 ms and &#964;fall = 22.5 ms. The effective synthesis method and excellent charge transport properties of AA&#8242;n&#8722;1MnX3n+1 type 2D perovskite single crystals make them promising candidates for the next generation of optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced Olefin Diamination with Alkylamines</title>
      <dc:description>Vicinal diamines are ubiquitous materials in organic and medicinal chemistry, and methods for their preparation are of relevance to a broad range of chemical applications. The direct coupling of olefin and amine building blocks would represent an ideal approach to construct these motifs. However, alkene diamination remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic synthesis, especially when two different amine components need to be introduced. Here we report a general strategy for the direct and selective assembly of vicinal 1,2&#8208;diamines using readily available olefin and amine building blocks. This mild and straightforward approach exploits the  in situ  formation and photoinduced activation of  N  &#8208;chloroamines leading to aminium radicals that enable efficient alkene aminochlorination. Owing to the ambiphilic nature of the b &#8208;chloroamines accessed, conversion into tetra&#8208;alkyl aziridinium ions was possible, thus enabling diamination by regioselective ring&#8208;opening with both primary and secondary amines. Overall, this strategy streamlines the preparation of vicinal diamines from current multi&#8208;step sequences to a single chemical transformation. This operationally simple process has broad functional group compatibility and enables the use of advanced building blocks for the preparation of drug&#8208;like small molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Emergence of Radical&#8208;Stabilizing Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a New Type of Radio&#8208;Photoluminescence Dosimeter</title>
      <dc:description>Radio&#8208;photoluminescence (RPL) materials display a distinct phenomenon of radiation induced permanent luminescence center, therefore finding critical applications in detection of ionizing radiation doses. The current inventory of RPL materials have been limited to a small range of metal ion doped inorganic materials with several demerits while old strategy for finding new RPL materials is serendipitous and challenging. Here we document the RPL property in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) for the first time by accumulating the X&#8208;ray induced free radicals on the organic linker, which are subsequently stabilized in the conjugated fragment in the structure while the metal center act as the X&#8208;ray attenuator. These radicals afford new emission features in both UV&#8208;excited and X&#8208;ray excited luminescence spectra, allowing for the establishment of linear relationships between radiation dose and the normalized intensity of the new emission feature. The MOF based RPL materials exhibit advantages in the dose detection range, reusability, emission stability, and energy threshold. Based on a comprehensive electronic structure and energy diagram study, a rational design philosophy and a substantial candidate expansion of RPL materials with application potentials can be anticipated.</dc:description>

      <title>Heteroatom dopants&#8208;promoted two&#8208;electron O2 reduction for photocatalytic production of H2O2 on polymeric carbon nitride</title>
      <dc:description>Polymeric carbon nitride modified with selected heteroatom dopants in a cyclic melon was prepared and used as a model photocatalyst to identify and understand the key mechanisms required for efficient photoproduction of H  2  O  2  via selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The photochemical production of H  2  O  2  was achieved at a millimolar level per hour under visible light irradiation along with 100% apparent quantum yield (in 360&#8208;450 nm region) and 96% selectivity in an electrochemical system (0.1 V vs. RHE). Spectroscopic analysis in spatiotemporal resolution and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic association of alkali and sulfur dopants in polymeric matrix promoted the interlayer charge separation and polarization of trapped electrons for preferable oxygen capture and reduction in ORR kinetics. This work highlights the key features that are responsible for controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward the two&#8208;electron ORR, which should be the basis of further development of solar H  2  O  2  production.</dc:description>

      <title>A Multitargeted Approach in the Discovery of an Organorhodium Anticancer Agent Based On Vorinostat as a Potent Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>The combination of more than one bioactive moiety in a mulitargeted anticancer agent may result in synergistic activity of its components. Using this concept, bioorganometallic compounds were designed to feature a metal center, a 2&#8208;pyridinecarbothioamide (PCA), and a hydroxamic acid, which is found in the anticancer drug vorinostat (SAHA). The organometallics showed inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range against histone deacetylases (HDACs) as the key target for SAHA. In particular, Rh complex  4c  was a potent inhibitor of HDAC6 over HDAC1 and HDAC8. While especially  4c  was highly cytotoxic in human cancer cells, it showed low toxicity in hemolysis studies and zebrafish, demonstrating the role of the metal center. For  4c  , a slightly reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was established, which was upregulated by SAHA. This indicates that the new organometallics display different modes of action than their components, supporting the development of non&#8208;conventional anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

While especially  4c  was highly cytotoxic in human cancer cells, it showed low toxicity in hemolysis studies and zebrafish, demonstrating the role of the metal center. For  4c  , a slightly reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was established, which was upregulated by SAHA. This indicates that the new organometallics display different modes of action than their components, supporting the development of non&#8208;conventional anticancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sequential and timely combination of cancer nanovaccine with immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits tumor growth and relapse</title>
      <dc:description>Cancer nanovaccines that use nanomaterials as antigens and/or adjuvant&#8208;delivering carriers can induce tumor antigen&#8208;specific T cell immunity and have shown potential as therapeutic modalities in in vivo animal models. Moreover, the addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy to cancer nanovaccines can further potentiate the antitumor efficacy of the latter. However, little effort has been made to develop an optimal treatment regimen based on treatment sequence and the timing of each modality. The present study describes a small lipid nanoparticle (SLNP)&#8208;based nanovaccine platform and a new combination treatment regimen. Tumor antigen&#8208;displaying, CpG adjuvant&#8208;embedded SLNPs (OVAPEP&#8208;SLNP@CpG) were prepared from biocompatible phospholipids and a cationic cholesterol derivative. The resulting nanovaccine showed highly potent antitumor efficacy in both prophylactic and therapeutic E.G7 tumor models. However, this vaccine simultaneously induced T cell exhaustion by elevating PD&#8208;L1 expression, leading to tumor recurrence. Thus, the nanovaccine was combined with simultaneous anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody treatment, but the therapeutic efficacy of this regimen was comparable to that of the nanovaccine alone. Finally, mice that showed a good therapeutic response after the first cycle of immunization with the nanovaccine underwent a second cycle of immunization together with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy, resulting in effective suppression of tumor relapse. These findings suggest that the antitumor efficacy of combinations of nanovaccines with ICB therapy is dependent on treatment sequence and the timing of each modality.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD), the ability to control a proteins fate by triggering its degradation in a highly selective and effective manner, has created tremendous excitement in chemical biology and drug discovery within the past decades. The TPD field is spearheaded by small molecule induced protein degradation with molecular glues and proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) paving the way to expand the druggable space and to create a new paradigm in drug discovery.

      <title>On the Dynamic Interaction of n&#8208;Butane with Imidazolium&#8208;based Ionic Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>The impact of a reactant from the gas phase on the surface of a liquid and its transfer through this gas/liquid interface are crucial for various concepts applying ionic liquids (ILs) in catalysis. We investigated the first step of the adsorption dynamics of n&#8208;butane on a series of 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ILs ([C  n  C  1  Im][Tf  2  N]; n = 1, 2, 3, 8). Using a supersonic molecular beam in ultra&#8208;high vacuum, the trapping of n&#8209;butane on the frozen ILs was determined as a function of surface temperature, between 90 and 125&#160;K. On the C  8  &#8208; and C  3  &#8208;ILs, n&#8208;butane adsorbs at 90&#160;K with an initial trapping probability of ~0.89. The adsorption energy increases with increasing length of the IL alkyl chain, whereas the ionic headgroups seem to interact only weakly with n&#8208;butane. The absence of adsorption on the C  1  &#8208; and C  2  &#8208;ILs is attributed to a too short residence time on the IL surface to form nuclei for condensation even at 90&#160;K.</dc:description>

      <title>N2 Electroreduction to NH3 via Selenium Vacancy&#8208;Rich ReSe2 Catalysis at an Abrupt Interface</title>
      <dc:description>Vacancy engineering has been proved repeatedly as an adoptable strategy to boost electrocatalysis, while its poor selectivity restricts the usage in nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as overwhelming competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Revealed by density functional theory calculations, the selenium vacancy in ReSe  2  crystal can enhance its electroactivity for both NRR and HER by shifting the  d  &#8208;band from &#8208;2.91 to &#8208;2.33 eV. To restrict the HER, we report a novel method by burying selenium vacancy&#8208;rich ReSe  2  @carbonized bacterial cellulose (V  r  &#8208;ReSe  2  @CBC) nanofibers between two CBC layers, leading to boosted Faradaic efficiency of 42.5% and ammonia yield of 28.3 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  at a potential of &#8208;0.25 V at an abrupt interface. As demonstrated by the nitrogen bubble adhesive force, superhydrophilic measurements, and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, the hydrophobic and porous CBC layers can keep the internal V  r  &#8208;ReSe  2  @CBC nanofibers away from water coverage, leaving more unoccupied active sites for the N  2  reduction (especially for the potential determining step of proton&#8208;electron coupling and transferring processes as *HNNH  2  &#8594; *H  2  NNH  2  ).</dc:description>

To restrict the HER, we report a novel method by burying selenium vacancy&#8208;rich ReSe  2  @carbonized bacterial cellulose (V  r  &#8208;ReSe  2  @CBC) nanofibers between two CBC layers, leading to boosted Faradaic efficiency of 42.5% and ammonia yield of 28.3 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  at a potential of &#8208;0.25 V at an abrupt interface. As demonstrated by the nitrogen bubble adhesive force, superhydrophilic measurements, and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, the hydrophobic and porous CBC layers can keep the internal V  r  &#8208;ReSe  2  @CBC nanofibers away from water coverage, leaving more unoccupied active sites for the N  2  reduction (especially for the potential determining step of proton&#8208;electron coupling and transferring processes as *HNNH  2  &#8594; *H  2  NNH  2  ).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Studying natural Buckyballs and Buckybowls in fossil materials</title>
      <dc:description>Buckyballs (Fullerenes) were first reported over 30 years ago, but still little is known regarding their natural occurrence, as they were only found at sites of high energy incidents, such as lightning strikes or meteor impacts but not reported in low energy materials like fossil fuels. Here, using ultrahigh&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, a wide range of Fullerenes from C  20  to C  114  was detected in an asphaltene fraction of a heavy crude oil, together with their building blocks of C  10n  H  10  &#8208;stoichiometry. High level DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) calculations corroborate their stability as spherical and hemi&#8208;spherical species. Interestingly, the maximum intensity of the Fullerenes was found at C  40  instead of the major Fullerene C  60  . Hence, experimental evidence supported by calculations show the existence of not only buckyballs, but also buckybowls as 3&#8208;dimensional polyaromatic compounds in fossil material.</dc:description>

      <title>Can Lithium Metal Anode Cycle at 90&#176;C in Liquid Electrolyte?</title>
      <dc:description>Stable operation at elevated temperature is necessary for lithium (Li) metal anode as the promising anode for next&#8208;generation batteries in diversified scenarios. However, Li metal anode generally undergoes poor performances and even safety concerns at high temperature (&gt; 55&#176;C) due to the thermal instability of electrolyte and solid electrolyte interphase in a routine liquid electrolyte. Herein a Li metal anode working at an elevated temperature of 90&#176;C is demonstrated in a thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte. In Li | LiFePO4 battery working at 90&#176;C, Li metal anode undergoes 100 cycles compared with 10 cycles in a practical carbonate electrolyte. During the formation of solid electrolyte interphase, the independent and incomplete decomposition of Li salts and solvents aggravate. Some unstable intermediate decomposition products emerge at 90&#176;C, degenerating the uniformity of Li deposition. This work not only demonstrates a working Li metal anode at 90&#176;C, but also provides fundamental understanding of solid electrolyte interphase and Li deposition at elevated temperature for rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>When Diazo Compounds Meet&#160;Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
      <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective &#8220;cut and sew&#8221; transformations employing diazo compounds and hypervalent iodine(III) compounds involve the departure of leaving groups, a &#8220;cut&#8221; process, followed by reorganizing of fragments by bond connections, a &#8220;sew&#8221; process.

      <title>Observation of Transition&#8208;Metal Boron Triple Bonds in IrB2O&#8211; and ReB2O&#8211;</title>
      <dc:description>Multiple bonds between boron and transition metals are known in many borylene (:BR) complexes via metal dp &#174; BR back donation, despite the electron&#8208;deficiency of boron. Electron&#8208;precise metal&#8208;boron triple bond was first observed in BiB2O&#8211; [Bi&#8801;B&#8208;B&#8801;O]&#8211;, in which both boron atoms can be viewed as being engaged in sp hybridization and the [B&#8208;BO]&#8211; fragment is isoelectronic to a carbyne (CR). To search for the first electron&#8208;precise transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron triple bond species, we have produced IrB2O&#8211; and ReB2O&#8211; and investigated them by photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum calculations. Well&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectra are combined with ab initio calculations to elucidate the structures and bonding in the two clusters. We find IrB2O&#8211; has a closed&#8208;shell bent structure (Cs, 1A'), with BO&#8211; coordinated to an Ir&#8801;B unit, (&#8211;OB)Ir&#8801;B, whereas ReB2O&#8211; is found to be linear (C&#8734;, 3S&#8211;) with an electron&#8208;precise Re&#8801;B triple bond, [Re&#8801;B&#8208;B&#8801;O]&#8211;. The current result suggests the intriguing possibility of synthesizing compounds with electron&#8208;precise M&#8801;B triple bonds analogous to the classical carbyne systems.</dc:description>

      <title>A Physical Model for Understanding the Activation of MoS2 Basal&#8208;plane Sulfur Atoms for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Weak binding of hydrogen atoms to the 2H&#8208;MoS  2  basal plane renders MoS  2  inert as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Transition metal doping can activate neighboring sulfur atoms in the MoS  2  basal plane to bind hydrogen more strongly. Our density functional theory&#8208;based studies show strong variation in the degree of activation by dopants across the 3d transition metal series (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). To understand the trends in activation, we propose a theoretical model based on the electronic promotion energy required to convert the full valence shell of a local sulfur atom to be partially open and therefore ready to bond with a hydrogen atom. In general, the promotion is achieved through an electron transfer from the sulfur to neighboring metal atom sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate a specific, electronic&#8208;structure based descriptor for hydrogen binding strength: D  dp  , the local interband energy separation between the lowest empty d&#8208;states on the dopant metal atoms and occupied p&#8208;states on S. This model can be used to provide guidelines for chalcogen activation in future catalyst design based on doped transition metal dichalcogenides.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2 fixation and energy storage. However, the development of electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity in a wide potential window is challenging. Herein, atomically thin bismuthene (Bi&#8208;ene) is pioneeringly obtained via an  in situ  electrochemical transformation process from ultrathin bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic layers.

Furthermore, it even can deliver extraordinary current densities exceed 300.0 mA cm&#8208;2 without compromising selectivity in a flow cell reactor. Furthermore, by virtue of  in situ  ATR&#8208;IR spectra and DFT analysis, a new HCO3&#8208; participated reaction mechanism for formate generation was firstly unveiled, which brings new fundamental understanding of CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Production of Hydrogen Peroxide by Photocatalytic Processes</title>
      <dc:description>
Peroxide from sunlight: The production of H2O2 by photocatalysis is a sustainable process, since it uses water and oxygen as the source materials and solar light as the energy. Encouraging processes have been developed in the last decade for the photocatalytic production of H2O2, and these are discussed in this Review.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has received increasing attention because it is not only a mild and environmentally friendly oxidant for organic synthesis and environmental remediation but also a promising new liquid fuel. The production of H2O2 by photocatalysis is a sustainable process, since it uses water and oxygen as the source materials and solar light as the energy. Encouraging processes have been developed in the last decade for the photocatalytic production of H2O2. In this Review we summarize research progress in the development of processes for the photocatalytic production of H2O2. After a brief introduction emphasizing the superiorities of the photocatalytic generation of H2O2, the basic principles of establishing an efficient photocatalytic system for generating H2O2 are discussed, highlighting the advanced photocatalysts used. This Review is concluded by a brief summary and outlook for future advances in this emerging research field.

      <title>PI by NMR: Probing CH&#8208;&#960; Interactions in Protein&#8208;Ligand Complexes by NMR</title>
      <dc:description>While CH&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interactions with target proteins are crucial determinants for the affinity of arguably every drug molecule, no method exists to directly measure the strength of individual CH&#8208;&#960; interactions in drug&#8208;protein complexes. Here we present a fast and reliable methodology called PI (&#960; interactions) by NMR, which can differentiate the strength of protein&#8208;ligand CH&#8208;&#960; interactions in solution. By combining selective amino&#8208;acid side&#8208;chain labeling with  1  H&#8208;  13  C NMR, we are able to identify specific protein protons of side&#8208;chains engaged in CH&#8208;&#960; interactions with aromatic ring&#8208;systems of a ligand, based solely on  1  H chemical shift values of the interacting protein aromatic ring protons. The information encoded in the chemical shifts induced by such interactions serves as a proxy for the strength of each individual CH&#8208;&#960; interaction. PI by NMR changes the paradigm by which chemists can optimize the potency of drug candidates: direct determination of individual &#960;&#8208;interactions rather than averaged measures of all interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Advances of Nanostructure Design for Alloy&#8208;Type Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Anode via In Situ TEM</title>
      <dc:description>Nanostructure engineering is widely acknowledged as an efficient approach to improve the electrochemical performance of materials, and more rational nanostructured materials design can be identified with the assistance of in situ characterization techniques. Herein, we combine novel nanostructure design and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation to demonstrate Sb&#8208;based nanofibers composed of bunched yolk&#8208;shell building units as a significantly improved anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Particularly, a metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;engaged electrospinning strategy coupled to a confined ion&#8208;exchange followed by a subsequent thermal reduction is proposed to fabricate yolk&#8208;shell Sb@C nanoboxes  embedded  in carbon nanofibers (Sb@CNFs). Notably, in situ TEM analysis reveals that the inner Sb nanoparticles undergo a significant volume expansion/contraction during the alloying/dealloying processes, while the void space can effectively relieve the overall volume change, and the plastic carbon shell maintains the structural integrity of electrode material. This work provides an important reference for the application of advanced characterization techniques to guide the optimization of electrode material design.</dc:description>

      <title>Light/Electricity Energy Conversion and Storage for Hierarchical Porous In2S3@CNT/SS Cathode towards a Flexible Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
      <dc:description>The low actual specific capacity, high overpotentials, and poor rate capability due to sluggish kinetics of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CDRR) and evolution reaction (CDER) hinder practical application of the Li&#8208;CO2  batteries. Herein, for the first time, we report a photo&#8208;induced flexible Li&#8208;CO2  battery with well&#8208;designed, hierarchical porous, and free&#8208;standing In2S3  @CNT/SS (ICS) as a bifunctional photoelectrode to accelerate both CDRR and CDER. The photo&#8208;induced Li&#8208;CO2  battery has achieved a record&#8208;high discharge voltage of 3.14 V which surpasses the thermodynamic limit of 2.80 V, and an ultra&#8208;low charge voltage of 3.20 V, achieving a round trip efficiency of 98.1%, which is the highest value ever reported (&lt;80%) so far. These excellent properties can be ascribed to the hierarchical porous and free&#8208;standing structure of ICS, as well as the key role of photo&#8208;generated electrons and holes during discharging and charging processes. What's more, a mechanism is proposed for "pre&#8208;activating" CO2  by reducing In3+  to In+  under light illumination in this work. The mechanism of the bifunctional light&#8208;assisted process provides a promising insight into photo&#8208;induced Li&#8208;CO2  batteries and contributes to resolving the major setbacks of the system.</dc:description>

In this self&#8208;supported strategy, catalysts with moderate chain walking capabilities produced porous polymer supports during gas&#8208;phase ethylene polymerization. The chain walking ability of the catalysts, in which the metal center can move up and down the polymer chain during polymerization, ensures that the metal center can travel along the polymer chain to find suitable sites for efficient ethylene enchainment. This strategy also enables simple heterogenization of catalysts on solid supports for slurry&#8208;phase polymerization which allows the polymer morphology to be controlled.

The synthetic procedure followed a divergent approach, where the p&#8208;Cl substituents in tris(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA3Cl) were replaced in one&#8208;step and high yield by electron&#8208;donating cyclic amines (pyrrolidine (TPMAPYR), piperidine (TPMAPIP), and morpholine (TPMAMOR)) via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The [CuII(TPMANR2)Br]+ complexes exhibited larger energy gaps between frontier molecular orbitals and &gt;0.2 V more negative reduction potentials than [CuII(TPMA)Br]+, indicating &gt;3 orders of magnitude higher ATRP activity. [CuI(TPMAPYR)]+ exhibited the highest reported activity for Br&#8208;capped acrylate chain ends in DMF, and moderate activity toward C&#8208;F bonds at room temperature. [CuI(TPMANR2)]+ could react with acrylate radicals forming organometallic species. However, this side reaction is suppressed in polymerization, because of the low equilibrium concentration of [CuI(TPMANR2)]+. Indeed, ATRP of n&#8208;butyl acrylate using only 10&#8208;25 part per million loadings of [CuII(TPMANR2)Br]+ exhibited excellent control.</dc:description>

      <title>In vivo imaging of the tumor&#8208;associated enzyme NCEH1 with a covalent PET probe</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the development of an 18F&#8208;labeled, activity&#8208;based small molecule probe targeting the cancer&#8208;associated serine hydrolase NCEH1. We undertook a focused medicinal chemistry campaign to simultaneously preserve potent and specific NCEH1 labeling in live cells and animals, while permitting facile 18F radionuclide incorporation required for PET imaging. The resulting molecule, [18F]JW199, labels active NCEH1 in live cells at nM concentrations and greater than 1,000&#8208;fold selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. [18F]JW199 displays rapid, NCEH1&#8208;dependent accumulation in mouse tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that [18F]JW199 labels aggressive cancer tumor cells in vivo, which uncovered localized NCEH1 activity at the leading edge of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer tumors, suggesting roles for NCEH1 in tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. More generally, these data support the broader development of potent and specific covalent PET probes to visualize localized, active enzymes in live animals.</dc:description>

      <title>Porous Organic Polymer Nanotrap for Efficient Extraction of Palladium</title>
      <dc:description>To offset the environmental impact of platinum group element (PGE) mining, recycling techniques are being thoroughly explored. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have shown significant promise, due to their selectivity and ability to withstand harsh conditions. A series of pyridine&#8208;based POP nanotraps, POP&#8208;Py, POP&#8208;pNH2&#8208;Py, and POP&#8208;oNH2&#8208;Py, have been rationally designed and systematically explored for the capture of palladium, one of the most utilized PGEs. All the POP nanotraps demonstrated record uptakes and rapid capture, with the amino group shown to be vital in improving performance. Further testing on the POP nanotrap regeneration and selectivity found that POP&#8208;oNH2&#8208;Py outperformed POP&#8208;pNH2&#8208;Py. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis indicated that POP&#8208;oNH2&#8208;Py provided a stronger complex compared to POP&#8208;pNH2&#8208;Py due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino group and coordinated chlorine molecules.

      <title>Development of CDK2 and CDK5 Dual Degrader TMX&#8208;2172</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. Development of CDK2 inhibitors has been extremely challenging as its ATP&#8208;binding site shares high similarity with CDK1, a related kinase whose inhibition causes toxic effects. Here, we report the development of TMX&#8208;2172, a heterobifunctional CDK2 degrader with degradation selectivity for CDK2 and CDK5 over not only CDK1, but transcriptional CDKs (CDK7 and CDK9) and cell cycle CDKs (CDK4 and CDK6) as well. In addition, we demonstrate that antiproliferative activity in ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR8) depends on CDK2 degradation and correlates with high expression of cyclin E1 (CCNE1), which functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK2. Collectively, our work provides evidence that TMX&#8208;2172 represents a lead for further development and that CDK2 degradation is a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy in ovarian and other cancers that overexpress CCNE1.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>2,3,3&#8208;Trisubstituted indolenine constitutes an integral part of many biologically important monoterpene indole alkaloids. We report herein an unprecedented access to this skeleton by a TiCl  3  &#8208;mediated reductive cyclization of tetrasubstituted alkenes bearing a 2&#8208;nitrophenyl substituent. The proof of concept is demonstrated firstly by accomplishing a concise total synthesis of (+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;dehydroaspidospermidine featuring a late stage application of this key transformation. A sequence of reduction of nitroarene to nitrosoarene followed by 6&#960; electron 5 atom electrocyclization and 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift of the resulting nitrone intermediate was proposed to account for the reaction outcome. A subsequent total synthesis of (+)&#8208;condyfoline not only illustrates the generality of the reaction, but also provides a mechanistic insight on the nature of the 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift. The exclusive formation of (+)&#8208;condyfoline indicates that the 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration follows a concerted Wagner&#8208;Meerwein pathway, rather than a stepwise retro&#8208;Mannich/Mannich reaction sequence.

      <title>Direct Catalytic Conversion of Ethanol to C5+ Ketones: Role of PdZn Alloy on Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
      <dc:description>Ethanol can be used as a platform molecule for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuel precursors.

A yield of &gt;70% to C  5+  ketones was achieved over a 0.1% Pd&#8208;ZnO&#8208;ZrO  2  mixed oxide catalyst, and the catalyst was demonstrated to be stable beyond 2000 hours on stream without any catalyst deactivation.</dc:description>

      <title>Oppositely Charged Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes with 2D Nanofluidic Channels for Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the blue: Osmotic energy, known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is derived by capturing this salinity gradient energy between sea water and fresh water. Negatively and positively charged lamellar MXene membranes with confined 2D nanofluidic channels give high&#8208;efficient osmotic energy harvesting, with a high output power density of 4.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing artificial sea water (SW) and river water (RW), which is close to the commercialization benchmark (5&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2).







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis (RED) is considered as the most promising technique to harvest osmotic energy. However, the traditional membranes are limited by high internal resistance and low efficiency, resulting in undesirable power densities. Herein, we report the combination of oppositely charged Ti3C2Tx MXene membranes (MXMs) with confined 2D nanofluidic channels as high&#8208;performance osmotic power generators. The negatively or positively charged 2D MXene nanochannels exhibit typical surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport and show excellent cation or anion selectivity. By mixing the artificial sea water (0.5&#8201;m NaCl) and river water (0.01&#8201;m NaCl), we obtain a maximum power density of ca. 4.6&#8197;Wm&#8722;2, higher than most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generators, and very close to the commercialization benchmark (5&#8197;Wm&#8722;2). Through connecting ten tandem MXM&#8208;RED stacks, the output voltage can reach up 1.66&#8197;V, which can directly power the electronic devices.

      <title>Unusual Through&#8208;Space Interactions between Oxygen Atoms that Mediate Inverse Morphochromism of an AIE Luminogen</title>
      <dc:description>
Close O&#8722;O contacts make me redder: The tetrafurylethene AIE luminogen has a strong red morphochromism going from the aggregate to the crystalline phase (27&#8197;nm). This is due to unusually short O&#8722;O contacts that are facilitated by circularly delocalized &#960; electron density between the furan rings.







Abstract
We have studied the photophysics of tetrafurylethene, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen with exceptionally short intramolecular O&#8722;O distances of 2.80&#8197;&#197; and a significant red&#8208;shifted morphochromism (27&#8197;nm) when going from the aggregate to the crystal. The short O&#8722;O distances, which are substantially smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04&#8197;&#197;), are due to the fact that the oxygen atoms act as an electronic bridge connecting the furan rings on opposite ends of the central double bond, giving rise to a circular delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electron density across the rings. In the excited state the O&#8722;O distance is further reduced to 2.70&#8197;&#197;; the increased O&#8722;O interaction causes a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in the red morphochromism of the emission. Our results show the structural origin of the red&#8208;shifted emission lies in close O&#8722;O contacts, paving the way for understanding the clusteroluminescence of oxygen&#8208;rich non&#8208;conjugated systems that emit visible light.

      <title>Diverse Nanoassemblies of Graphene Quantum Dots and Their Mineralogical Counterparts</title>
      <dc:description>
Complex structures from nanoparticles are found in rocks, soils, and sea sediments but the mechanisms of their formation are poorly understood. It is shown that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into complex structures driven by coordination interactions with metal ions commonly present in the environment and play a special role in Earth's history, such as Fe3+ and Al3+.







Abstract
Complex structures from nanoparticles are found in rocks, soils, and sea sediments but the mechanisms of their formation are poorly understood, which causes controversial conclusions about their genesis. Here we show that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into complex structures driven by coordination interactions with metal ions commonly present in environment and serve a special role in Earth's history, such as Fe3+ and Al3+. GQDs self&#8208;assemble into mesoscale chains, sheets, supraparticles, nanoshells, and nanostars. Specific assembly patterns are determined by the effective symmetry of the GQDs when forming the coordination assemblies with the metal ions. As such, maximization of the electronic delocalization of &#960;&#8208;orbitals of GQDs with Fe3+ leads to GQD&#8208;Fe&#8208;GQD units with D2 symmetry, dipolar bonding potential, and linear assemblies. Taking advantage of high electron microscopy contrast of carbonaceous nanostructures in respect to ceramic background, the mineralogical counterparts of GQD assemblies are found in mineraloid shungite. These findings provide insight into nanoparticle dynamics during the rock formation that can lead to mineralized structures of unexpectedly high complexity.

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Organic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Taking the shortcut: Examples of tunneling by second&#8208;row atoms are increasing and the limits are being expanded. This Minireview summarizes recent examples of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling, highlights unique approaches for its detection, and describes computational efforts toward its prediction.

Abstract
In the past few years, numerous investigations have been reported on the role of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling in the area of pericyclic reactions, &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;shifting, and other processes. These studies illustrate unique strategies for the experimental detection of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling and the increased use of calculations to predict it. This Minireview focuses primarily on carbon tunneling in ground&#8208;state processes but also highlights nitrogen tunneling and the first example of excited&#8208;state heavy&#8208;atom tunneling. Salient features of these reactions along with potential limitations are discussed, as well as challenges and directions for future investigation.

      <title>Unraveling Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Behavior in Steric&#8208;Hindrance Photochromic System for Super Resolution Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual AIE behavior: The steric&#8208;hindrance photochromic system efficiently regulates the intramolecular rotational/vibrational magnitude and intermolecular stacking to tune aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity. The off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescent photoswitch is successfully established in super resolution imaging.







Abstract
Unprecedented dual aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior based on a steric&#8208;hindrance photochromic system is presented, with incorporation one or two bulky aryl groups, resulting in different flexibleness. The dual AIE behavior of open and closed isomers can be explained by restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR), restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV), and intermolecular stacking. The large bulky benzothiophene causes restricted rotation, enhancing the emission of open form in solution and weak &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecular packing, thereby efficiently enhancing the luminescence performance in the solid state. With incorporation of two large bulky benzothiophene groups, BBTE possesses the most outstanding AIE activity, undergoing highly efficient and reversible off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescence in film upon alternating UV and visible light irradiation along with excellent fatigue resistance. The off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescent photoswitch is successfully established in super resolution imaging.

      <title>High&#8208;Curvature Transition&#8208;Metal Chalcogenide Nanostructures with a Pronounced Proximity Effect Enable Fast and Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
The needle has landed: CdS nanostructures with sharp tips can generate large electric fields that lead to increased CO2 concentrations for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The localized electric fields are significantly enhanced when two nanoneedles are in close proximity. These advantages result in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction with a 95.5&#177;4.0&#8201;% CO Faraday efficiency.







Abstract
A considerable challenge in the conversion of carbon dioxide into useful fuels comes from the activation of CO2 to CO2.&#8722; or other intermediates, which often requires precious&#8208;metal catalysts, high overpotentials, and/or electrolyte additives (e.g., ionic liquids). We report a microwave heating strategy for synthesizing a transition&#8208;metal chalcogenide nanostructure that efficiently catalyzes CO2 electroreduction to carbon monoxide (CO). We found that the cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoneedle arrays exhibit an unprecedented current density of 212&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 95.5&#177;4.0&#8201;% CO Faraday efficiency at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; without iR correction). Experimental and computational studies show that the high&#8208;curvature CdS nanostructured catalyst has a pronounced proximity effect which gives rise to large electric field enhancement, which can concentrate alkali&#8208;metal cations resulting in the enhanced CO2 electroreduction efficiency.

      <title>Free&#8208;Standing CoO&#8208;POM Janus&#8208;like Ultrathin Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Van der Waals integration of ultrathin Janus&#8208;like 2D heterostructures can also be achieved in a single step through a solution&#8208;based approach. The structural configuration can be simply changed by proper selection of solvents. Such a heteromaterial has tunable properties and can be used as an advanced oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
A single&#8208;step solution&#8208;based strategy is used to obtain 2D Janus&#8208;like free&#8208;standing ultrathin nanosheets build from two structurally unrelated species, that is, polyoxomolybdate (POM) and CoO. A controlled 2D&#8208;to&#8208;1D morphological transition was achieved by judiciously adjusting the solvent choice. These POM&#8208;CoO heterostructures can behave as an ideal catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene. Benefiting from their amphiphilic nature, these 2D POM&#8208;CoO nanosheets have also been used as surfactant to emulsify immiscible solvents. It is anticipated that structurally diverse polyoxometalates will offer promise as design elements for variety of structurally and compositionally tunable van der Waals integrated heteromaterials having a broad range applications.
